Generate a question about the following movie plot: On Halloween night of 1963, six-year-old Michael Myers, dressed in a clown costume and mask, stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, he escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium in a car that was to take him to a court hearing, the verdict of which was for him to be locked up forever. The next day, 21-year-old Michael (Nick Castle), now wearing a mechanic's uniform and a white mask, returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois and begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) after she drops off a key at his old house (where the murder took place) so her father can sell it. Her two best friends Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) dismiss Laurie's concerns that someone is following her. Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), having anticipated Michael's return home, goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers' headstone missing. Loomis meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael. When Annie's boyfriend Paul calls her to come pick him up, she takes Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) to the Doyle house, just across the street, to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews). Michael strangles Annie after she gets into her car. While playing hide-and-seek with Lindsey, Tommy sees Michael carrying Annie's body into the Wallace house, and, believing he's the \\"boogeyman\\", tries to tell a skeptical Laurie about what he saw. Later, Lynda and her boyfriend Bob enter the Wallace house to spend the night together. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, but Michael ambushes and impales him. He then poses as Bob in a ghost costume and confronts Lynda, who kids around with him. After no response, she calls Laurie; just as Laurie answers the phone, Michael strangles Lynda with the telephone cord. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis discovers the car Michael had stolen,...

Question: The answer to the question: What composition premiered in March 1905? is inside the article: Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside., can you guess it ?

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is the drifters lawyer?, using the article: In Texas, a drifter faces the death penalty in just a few days. His only hope is that his lawyers can persuade the serial killer Richard Ramirez to confess to the crime instead. His legal team includes Kit, who is tasked with traveling to California, and visiting Ramirez in San Quentin State Prison in an attempt to persuade him to confess. She stays in a budget hotel and spends time in a bar during her time off. The murder in Texas took place before Ramirez's first known killing. Kit initially speaks with Ramirez by phone through glass; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room. There, he demands she remove her gold jewelry; he says that he is a Satanist, and gold is offensive to Satan because it is God's metal. He remains uncooperative because guards are in the room, but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she's his lawyer. Even then he remains uncooperative and insulting, demanding that she reveal personal details about herself to make herself interesting enough that she deserves to know more about him.

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity. and the situation: Over the years, the town of Euphoria has grown more successful and wealthier than anyone ever thought.

The Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert, Calif., made about 50,000 holding Republican fundraisers. And at Butterfield's Golf Car Sales in Montvale, Va., owner David Helms rang up 300 in cart rentals for the campaign of Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte (R). \\"That may pay for the light bill for about a week,\\" Helms said. \\"But we'll certainly take it.\\" Call it the midterm stimulus program. The record-breaking campaign showered billions of dollars on a broad array of companies, including broadcast conglomerates, polling firms and small-town restaurants, according to a Washington Post analysis of expenditure reports. Candidates spent at least 50 million on catering and liquor, 3.2 million at country clubs and golf courses, and 500,000 on pizza, coffee and doughnuts, the records show. Expenditures for the elections began in January 2009, although most of the money was spent in recent months. The spending came at a fortunate time for many businesses struggling with tepid growth and a national unemployment rate stuck near 10 percent. Experts predict that total spending for the congressional midterms will approach 4 billion, putting it on par with the 3 billion \\"Cash for Clunkers\\" program in 2009 aimed at boosting auto sales. \\"It's certainly had an impact on the bottom lines of many of these companies, particularly in the media area,\\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \\"It probably improved things for some of them at a critical time.\\" Campaigns paid banks to handle their money, consultants to map out their strategies and media buyers to book their advertising. The biggest winners of all were broadcasters, which together are expected to rake in about 2.5 billion in ad revenue from federal, state and local campaigns, according to industry estimates. One example is Sinclair Broadcasting of Hunt Valley, Md., which owns or operates 58 television stations nationwide, including many in Ohio, Kentucky and other battleground states. The company said last week that political ad revenue will top 41 million this year, a 35 percent increase from 2006. The rising fortunes allowed Sinclair to announce a special dividend payment to shareholders for the first time since early 2009, when payments stopped as a result of the recession. Sinclair executives did not respond to a request to comment. \\"It's helped everyone get back on their feet, because last year was terrible,\\" said Tony Lenoir, a broadcast industry analyst at SNL Kagan. \\"It's a really good thing there was a big election this year.\\" Politics is their specialty Much of the money spent on campaigns went to a relatively small number of media buyers, consultants and polling firms that specialize in politics, according to Federal Election Commission records. The records also show only part of the picture, because most political committees and independent groups have not submitted final reports. ||||| Campaign spending for the 2010 election cycle will probably surpass 4 billion, easily beating out the 2006 midterm total of 2.85 billion. The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which permitted unions and corporations to spend without limit, is partly responsible for the surge. Will all that spending help stimulate the economy? Probably not. For spending to give the economy a boost, the money has to come from some less productive use. Buying a car, for example, is better for the economy than stashing your money in a vault. (Starting your own business might be better still.) When an individual gives cash to a political campaign for, say, an attack ad, those dollars end up going to a television station or production company. That business might in turn use the money to purchase a new set of video cameras, and the manufacturer of those cameras might invest in the design of its products. In theory, that cascade of activity should help the economy to grow. But most analysts say the gains would be illusory, since campaign donations are likely to reflect shifts in consumption habits and nothing more. Most political donors wouldn't otherwise be hoarding that capital. If they weren't supporting their favorite candidates, they'd be going out for fancy dinners or buying iPads. The effect on GDP would be the same. What about corporations and unions? Corporate donations may be a net minus for the economy when they come at the expense of more direct business investment. Target, for example, could be less inclined to build a new store in Gary, Ind., after having spent 150,000 to support a candidate for Minnesota governor. Those kinds of moves are bad for the economy, because investment dollars are very good at generating economic activity. (Corporate donors may view their expenditures as investments in beneficial economic policies, but that kind of stimulus is far too speculative for economists to measure.) Unions, for their part, don't really make those sorts of investments. Their political donations function more like shifts in consumer spending. Advertisement Even if all 4 billion in 2010 campaign spending came out from under mattresses across the country, the effect on our economy would be minimal. National GDP is 14 trillion (PDF), so 4 billion represents a mere 0.03 percent surge. (For comparison, the 2009 federal stimulus plan was 787 billion, or 5.6 percent of GDP.) If we generously assume that the overall effect of every dollar would double as it moved from buyer to seller, the 2010 election would grow the economy by 0.06 percent. To put that into perspective, most economists found last quarter's two-percent growth rate disappointing. While campaign spending won't rescue the economy, it is a massive stimulus plan for local television stations. During most of the year, businesses have little trouble buying advertising time, even on short notice. The stations fill their available slots with low-cost, tentative commitments that can be pre-empted if someone comes in offering more money. But national political candidates, who desperately want their commercials to run in the days before an election, pay top rates to ensure that no one can bump them. If you called your local affiliate today, there's probably no amount of money that could buy you a slot. In addition, stations raise rates steadily throughout the campaign to squeeze as much money as they can out of their few remaining commercial spaces. The 3 billion to be spent on television ads this year will eclipse both the 2.4 billion in the 2006 midterms and the 2.7 billion during the last presidential election. As a result, some stations are ransoming their slots for two and a half times their 2008 prices. Got a question about today's news? Ask the Explainer .

Instructions: In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Goodbye, Mr. Chips Context: In 1920s Britain, Arthur Chipping is an established member of the teaching staff at the Brookfield School. He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base. Too late for his wife to share in his happiness, Chips was picked as headmaster of Brookfield that same day, and lives out his years at the school, loved by his pupils and comforted by his happy memories.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. I am facing a new situation today: People from two villages ate lots of salt. People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village had more people with enhanced health? Answer:","completion":"The village with more people with enhanced health would be the Sand village, as they used iodized salt in their diets.

We're trying to find out what 't' is in this equation. So we have: 25*t - 104*t = -1027 Now, imagine you have 25 toy cars and then you have 104 toy cars. If you put them together, you'd have (25-104) toy cars. That means you'd have -79 toy cars. That's weird, huh? But we're just playing pretend right now. So, now our equation looks like: -79*t = -1027 Now, imagine you have a big bag of candies and you need to share it with your -79 imaginary friends. To find out how many candies each imaginary friend will get, we need to divide the total candies (-1027) by the number of friends (-79). So, we divide -1027 by -79: -1027 / -79 = 13 That means 't' is equal to 13. So the solution to our math problem is t = 13. Good job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: 0 = -1719*f + 1760*f - 41 First, we need to combine the terms with \\"f\\" in them: -1719*f and 1760*f.

Then slowly, the rocks broke up into smaller and smaller pieces. Finally stones, pebbles and grains of sand were formed. Many sorts of plants and animals lived and died on the surface of the earth. Their remains mixed up with the stones, pebbles and formed soil. The outmost layer of the earth is soil. There are many ways in which large pieces of rock break into smaller ones. Wind, water, heat and cold help to break up rocks. When winds blow grains of sand against a large rock for a long time, the softer layers of the rock are slowly worn away. These leave holes and cracks in the rock, which become bigger and finally the rock breaks up into smaller pieces. The moving water of streams and rivers also helps to break up rocks. As the water moves along, it carries with it small pieces of rock. These rub the larger ones. Thus, the larger rocks are worn down to smaller pieces. The heat of the sun is also helpful to breaking up rocks. When the sun shines, the rocks become very hot. If these rocks are suddenly cooled, they may crack. Ice also plays a part in making soil. Water in the cracks can turn into ice in cold weather. As this happens, it becomes bigger and the cracks become wider, and finally break into smaller pieces. Which of the following speeds up the breaks of rocks most? A) Hot weather. B) Cold water. C) Sharp changes in temperature. D) More dead plants in the cracks.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: For a long time being happy was considered something that just happened, and there was nothing special about it. Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change. Question: The purpose for the writer to write the passage is to _ .

As one of Jesus Christ's Twelve Apostles, he played a crucial role in the early development of the Christian faith. Philip's life as an apostle began when Jesus called him to follow as a disciple. During his time with Jesus, Philip was known to have been instrumental in the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, as he helped provide the loaves of bread. This event has led to Philip's association with a basket of loaves and a tau cross - symbols often used to depict him in art and literature. After Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, Philip continued to preach the gospel. His ministry took him to various parts of the Roman Empire, including Hierapolis in Anatolia, where he met his death in 80 A.D. As a martyr for his faith, Philip was greatly honored by the early church, and his legacy continues to be celebrated today. Philip the Apostle has been canonized as a saint in the Pre-Congregation era, and his feast day is observed on different dates across various Christian denominations - 3rd November in the Eastern Orthodox Church, 1st May in the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Church, and 11th May in the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church. Over the centuries, many artists have portrayed Philip in their works, with one noteworthy example being Peter Paul Rubens' depiction in his \\"Twelve Apostles\\" series (c. 1611), which can be found in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Today, St. Philip is recognized as the patron saint of several places and professions, including Cape Felipe Pueblo and Uruguay; Verde; hatters; and pastry chefs. In conclusion, Philip the Apostle's life and ministry have had a lasting impact on the Christian faith across different denominations and regions. His dedication and selflessness in spreading the gospel, as well as his eventual martyrdom, have earned him veneration and respect in both religious and historical contexts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The story is set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, inspired by the real-life Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain spent his childhood. Although the exact years the novel takes place are not explicitly stated, it is generally accepted that the events occur in the 1840s based on references to the culture, social norms, and historical events mentioned throughout the book. The story's time period is important to understand the societal and cultural context in which the characters lived. During the mid-1800s, the U.S. was undergoing significant changes, such as westward expansion, the gold rush, and the build-up to the Civil War. These events influenced the lives of people in small Midwestern towns like St. Petersburg, as well as contributed to the moral and religious aspects prevalent in Tom Sawyer's world. Throughout the novel, readers encounter various elements that reflect the historical period, such as the importance of the Mississippi River in the lives of the inhabitants, the presence of the Christian church in their communities, and the prevailing attitudes towards Jim, a run-away slave character from Twain's sequel, \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\" Slavery was still legal during the time the story takes place, which is an important factor when considering the social environment of the region. Furthermore, the novel also introduces a detailed depiction of the daily life of children in the 19th-century Midwest. Tom's adventures include playing with his friends, attending church and school, and generally experiencing a slice of life during that era. The cultural norms of discipline, work, etiquette, and family life are woven into the development of various characters and their relationships, providing deep insights into this specific time period. In conclusion, \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" takes place in the mid-1800s in a fictionalized version of Hannibal, Missouri, during the pre-Civil War era. The historical context, social norms, and cultural aspects that are present throughout the book help to paint an accurate picture of life in the 19th-century Midwest, giving readers an immersive reading experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That was until we started talking about how to raise our kids (we’re not serious about it yet but it’s a fun or cute scenario). Until they said, I think seriously but I’m not sure, that they’re all going to therapy. For context super quick I suffer from hardcore depression and anxiety. I’m naturally already a sensitive person but without my meds I’m twice as sensitive and twice as emotional. While we were in this date I was having specially made meds for me so I was off them for a week or so. Anyway, I got confused and asked what they meant. They laughed and told me they didn’t want to finish the joke but I just laughed and said “Come on finish it.” They said laughed and said “Because one depressed Twilipig is enough for me to handle.” I won’t lie, that stung a little. I can be a handful and I’m aware. I don’t have many friends and every time I try to make friends they either reject me or drop me fast. That was towards the end of dinner so we just paid the cheque and left. When I’m upset I need time to process and thing of the proper words to say, my SO knows this. The drive home was very quiet. He dropped me off and left and texted me asking if I was okay. I didn’t respond cause I was still upset and still needed time to think of what to say. They called a few minutes later and I picked up. “Hey, what’s wrong?” “I won’t lie SO, the therapy remark kind of hurt my feelings. You know how I feel about that kind of talk.” “Oh my god babe it was a joke!” “I know but it still really hurt my feelings.” “Oh my god I can’t make any jokes with you it’s so annoying.” “That is so not true, you just know I don’t like mental health jokes.” “Yeah right whatever. I’m tired about you being so sensitive about it. It’s not even that big of a deal, people have it-“ I hung up on them in tears.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of plants in the class Isoetopsida and order Isoetales. They are lycopods and the only genus in Isoetaceae. There are currently 192 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\", although molecular data place these species among other species of \\"Isoetes\\", so \\"Stylites\\" does not warrant taxonomic recognition. - Selaginella is the sole genus of vascular plants in the family Selaginellaceae, the spikemosses or lesser clubmosses. This family is placed in the class Isoetopsida, distinguished from the sister group Lycopodiopsida (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types. They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the \\"fern allies\\". \\"S. moellendorffii\\" is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name \\"Selaginella\\" was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species \\"Selaginella selaginoides\\", which turns out (with the closely-related \\"Selaginella deflexa\\") to be a clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginellas\\", so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in \\"Selaginella\\", with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera. - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds. - Isoetales, formerly also written Isoëtales, is an order of plants in the class Isoetopsida. There are about 140-150 living species, all of which are classified in the genus \\"Isoetes\\" (quillworts), with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Living species are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are found in clear ponds and slowly moving streams. Each leaf is slender and broadens downward to a swollen base up to 5 mm wide where the leaves attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground corm characteristic of most quillworts. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope. - The U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), located in Walnut Creek, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Today the DOE JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The DOE JGI also collaborates with other national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). - The Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like \\"Baragwanathia\\" that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants. - A ligule (from \\"strap\\", variant of \\"lingula\\", from \\"lingua\\" \\"tongue\\") is a thin outgrowth at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, such as that of a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae. - Ambroise Marie François Joseph Palisot, Baron de Beauvois (27 July 1752, Arras 21 January 1820, Paris) was a French naturalist. - The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative. DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories. - Selaginella selaginoides is a non-flowering plant of the spikemoss genus \\"Selaginella\\" with a wide distribution around the Northern Hemisphere. It resembles a moss in appearance but is a vascular plant belonging to the division Lycopodiophyta. It has a number of common names including lesser clubmoss, club spikemoss, northern spikemoss, low spikemoss and prickly mountain-moss. This plant has one close relative, \\"Selaginella deflexa\\", native to Hawaii. These two plants form a small clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginella\\" species. - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta. - A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution. - The Isoetopsida is a class of Lycopodiophyta. All extant species belong to the genus \\"Selaginella\\" in the order Selaginellales or to the genus \\"Isoetes\\" in the order Isoetales. In the past, members of this group sometimes have been placed in the classes Isoetopsida, Selaginellopsida, or Lycopodiopsida. There are c. 700 species of \\"Selaginella\\" and 140-150 species of \\"Isoetes\\", with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split \\"Isoetes\\" by separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\". - The Lycopodiopsida are a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies . Traditionally , the group included not only the clubmosses and firmosses , but also the spikemosses ( Selaginella and relatives ) and the quillworts ( Isoetes and relatives ) . However , the latter are now usually placed into a separate class , Isoetopsida .

Kang-woo invites his old friend to join the weekly mahjong night at his house, and there, Sang-hyun finds himself attracted to Kang-wooâs wife, Tae-ju (Kim Ok-bin). Sang-hyun later relapses into his illness and wakes in dire need of shelter from the sunlight, having become a vampire. At first, Sang-hyun feels a new-found vigor but soon he is aghast to find himself drinking blood from a comatose patient. After attempting to kill himself, Sang-hyun finds himself irresistibly drawn to human blood. To make matters worse, the symptoms of EV return and only seem to go away when he has drunk blood. Desperately trying to avoid committing a murder, Sang-hyun resorts to stealing blood transfusion packs from the hospital. Tae-ju, who lives with her ill husband and overprotective mother-in-law, Lady Ra (Kim Hae-sook), leads a dreary life. She is drawn to Sang-hyun and his odd new physicality, including his inability to resist his desires. The two begin an affair, but when Tae-ju discovers the truth about Sang-hyun, she retreats in fear. When Sang-hyun pleads with her to run away with him, she turns him down, suggesting that they kill her husband instead.[5] When Sang-hyun's superior... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Thirst\\", breaking down Kate's resistance (Tae-ju) is central to the development of the relationship between her and Sang-hyun, the protagonist who has become a vampire. There are a few key ways in which this process unfolds: 1. Emotional connection: Sang-hyun's initial attraction to Tae-ju is strengthened by the emotional bond they form as a result of their similar feelings of entrapment and dissatisfaction with their lives. Both characters are unhappy: Sang-hyun with his crisis of faith and newfound vampire nature, and Tae-ju with her dull, controlled life. This mutual understanding and shared dissatisfaction with their lives form the basis of their emotional connection, making it easier for Sang-hyun to try and break down her resistance. 2. Physical attraction: Sang-hyun's transformation into a vampire brings about a noticeable change in his physicality, which draws Tae-ju to him. His newfound strength, agility, and sensuality pique her curiosity and make her feel attracted to him. This physical attraction, combined with their emotional connection, helps in breaking down her initial resistance towards him and towards the affair they eventually engage in. 3. Challenging her fears: When Tae-ju discovers the truth about Sang-hyun's vampirism, she initially retreats in fear. However, Sang-hyun pleads with her to run away with him, offering her a chance to escape her dreary life and indulge in the freedom and passion she craves. By challenging her fears and offering her a way out, he manages to break down her resistance further. 4. Manipulation: Sang-hyun resorts to manipulation when he suggests that they kill Tae-ju's husband, Kang-woo. This plan appeals to Tae-ju's desire for freedom from her life and future with her husband as well as the overbearing presence of her mother-in-law. While this decision is morally dubious, it shows the extent to which Sang-hyun is willing to go to break down Tae-ju's resistance and keep her by his side. 5. Showing her the darker side: Throughout the course of the movie, Sang-hyun reveals the darker aspects of his nature to Tae-ju, as he struggles to maintain his humanity while grappling with his vampire instincts. By involving her in his world and making her a part of it, he makes it easier for her to accept him and break down any remaining resistance she may have had. In conclusion, breaking down Tae-ju's resistance in \\"Thirst\\" is achieved through various means: forming an emotional connection, enticing her with physical attraction, challenging her fears, manipulating her situation, and involving her in the darker aspects of Sang-hyun's world. Combining these methods, Sang-hyun is able to win her over, fully dismantle her resistance, and forge a deep bond with her – albeit leading to a series of morally ambiguous and ultimately tragic events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. where are rod cells located in the retina??","completion":"To find the location of rod cells in the retina, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the structure of the retina The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue located at the back of the eye. It is responsible for converting light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The retina has multiple layers: innermost, middle, outer, etc. Step 2: Identify the relevant layers for rod cells Rod cells are one type of photoreceptor cells found in the retina. They are primarily responsible for vision in low-light conditions and for peripheral vision. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are located in the outer layer of the retina, while cones are concentrated in the central region, known as the fovea. Step 3: Locate the rod cells within the retina layers Rod cells are located in the outer nuclear layer of the retina, which is specifically responsible for housing the cell bodies of the photoreceptors. Rod cells are distributed throughout most of the retina, with a higher density in the peripheral areas. In summary, rod cells are mainly located in the outer nuclear layer of the retina and are predominantly distributed throughout the peripheral regions of the retina, providing low-light and peripheral vision capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin. - Christology (from Greek \\"Khristós\\" and , \\"-logia\\") is the field of study within Christian theology which is primarily concerned with the nature and person of Jesus as recorded in the canonical Gospels and the epistles of the New Testament. Primary considerations include the relationship of Jesus' nature and person with the nature and person of God the Father. As such, Christology is concerned with the details of Jesus' ministry, his acts and teachings, to arrive at a clearer understanding of who he is in his person, and his role in salvation. The views of Paul the Apostle provided a major component of the Christology of the Apostolic Age. Paul's central themes included the notion of the pre-existence of Christ and the worship of Christ as \\"Kyrios\\" (Greek: \\"Lord\\"). - The Unitarian Church of Transylvania is a church of the Unitarian denomination, based in the city of Cluj, Transylvania, Romania. Founded in 1568 in the Principality of Transylvania, it has a majority-Hungarian following, and is one of the 18 religious confessions given official recognition by the Romanian state. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - The Polish Brethren (Polish: \\"Bracia Polscy\\") were members of the Minor Reformed Church of Poland, a Nontrinitarian Protestant church that existed in Poland from 1565 to 1658. By those on the outside, they were called \\"Arians\\" or \\"Socinians\\" (\\")\\", but themselves preferred simply to be called \\"Brethren\\" or \\"Christians,\\" and, after their expulsion from Poland, \\"Unitarians\\". - Socinianism is a system of Christian doctrine named for Fausto Sozzini (Latin: Faustus Socinus), which was developed among the Polish Brethren in the Minor Reformed Church of Poland during the 16th and 17th centuries and embraced by the Unitarian Church of Transylvania during the same period. It is most famous for its nontrinitarian Christology but contains a number of other unorthodox beliefs as well. - Fausto Paolo Sozzini , also known as Faustus Socinus or Faust Socyn ( Polish ) ( 5 December 1539 -- 4 March 1604 ) , was an Italian theologian and founder of the school of Christian thought known as Socinianism and the main theologian of Polish Brethren ( a Protestant Polish church ) .

To do this, we begin by moving -2*q from the right side to the left side of the equation in order to combine like terms. We add 2*q to both sides: 11*q + 2*q = -2*q + 2*q + 13 This simplification results in 13*q = 13 Step 3: Now we can isolate \`q\` by dividing both sides of the equation by 13: 13*q / 13 = 13 / 13 Once simplified, we have: q = 1 Justification: These steps follow the principles of algebra for solving linear equations which involves the use of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

Does \\"Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.\\" correctly answer the question of What theory did Erasmus Darwin outline in the 1790s?","completion":"No, the statement \\"Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.\\" does not correctly answer the question of what theory Erasmus Darwin outlined in the 1790s. Instead, this statement refers to Georges Cuvier's opposition to Erasmus Darwin's ideas about evolution and the development of species. To answer the question, we must first discuss the theory proposed by Erasmus Darwin and then briefly address how Georges Cuvier reacted to the theory. Erasmus Darwin, a British naturalist, scientist, and physician, formulated early ideas related to evolution in the 1790s, significantly predating the theories proposed by his grandson Charles Darwin. In his notable work \\"Zoonomia; or the Laws of Organic Life\\" (1794-1796), Erasmus Darwin outlined the concept of transmutation of species, hinting at the idea that species were not fixed but could change and evolve over time. Specifically, he suggested that all living organisms, including humans, had descended from a single common ancestor over millions of years, a process driven by environmental pressures and competition for resources. Erasmus Darwin's theory also included the idea of acquired characteristics, proposing that organisms could pass on traits they had acquired throughout their lifetime to their offspring, thus ensuring the improvement and adaptation of the species as a whole. This idea, which later came to be known as Lamarckism, after the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, was not universally accepted among scientists of the time. Georges Cuvier, a French naturalist, zoologist, and paleontologist, was a significant figure in the development of comparative anatomy and paleontology, and he strongly opposed the ideas put forth by Erasmus Darwin. Cuvier believed in the fixity of species, meaning that each species was created and remained unaltered throughout its existence. He argued that species' similarities were the result of their functional needs and the overarching design created by a higher power, rather than stemming from any shared evolutionary ancestry. Cuvier further contended that any drastic changes to an organism's morphology, as proposed by Erasmus Darwin, would render that organism unable to survive, reinforcing his stance on the immutability of species and the distinct separation between them. He sought to debunk the idea of evolution by showing that species were created with a specific, functional purpose, though his interpretation of the fossil record ultimately contributed to the eventual acceptance of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In conclusion, the statement provided does not directly answer the question about Erasmus Darwin's theory from the 1790s. Instead, the pertinent information would be that Erasmus Darwin proposed an early theory about the transmutation and evolution of species, suggesting that all living organisms descended from a single common ancestor and could pass on acquired characteristics to their offspring. Georges Cuvier contested this idea, emphasizing the fixity of species and their similarities due to functional requirements and intelligent design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is generally difficult to have dual citizenship of India and another country, due to the provisions for loss of Indian nationality when an Indian national naturalizes in another country (see \`\`Loss of citizenship'' above), and the requirement to renounce one's existing citizenships when naturalizing in India (see \`\`Naturalization'' above). Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: can you have dual indian and british citizenship?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that having dual citizenship of both India and the United Kingdom (British citizenship) is not permissible under the current laws and regulations of India. This difficulty arises because of two main factors: the provisions for the loss of Indian nationality upon acquiring citizenship in another country and the requirement to relinquish existing citizenship(s) when naturalizing in India. Firstly, the loss of Indian citizenship occurs when an individual who holds Indian nationality chooses to pursue naturalization in another country, such as the United Kingdom. The Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognize dual citizenship and therefore requires Indian citizens to give up their nationality when acquiring citizenship in another nation. Consequently, an individual who gains British citizenship would typically lose their Indian citizenship as per the Indian law. Secondly, acquiring Indian nationality through naturalization also necessitates the renouncement of one's existing citizenship(s). This process would involve renouncing British citizenship (if held) before naturalizing as an Indian citizen. Consequently, a British citizen who seeks to become an Indian national would need to give up their British citizenship in the process. In light of these legal provisions, obtaining and maintaining dual Indian and British citizenship is not feasible under the current regulations governing Indian nationality. Individuals who wish to hold citizenship in both countries may need to explore alternative options and consider the implications of choosing one citizenship over the other. It is essential to consult relevant authorities or legal experts on matters related to citizenship and immigration to ensure adherence to all laws and regulations in both countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The dog is outside. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude the hypothesis that the dog is outside based on the given premise. The premise provided contains several contextual clues and environmental elements that support the hypothesis that the dog is indeed outside. First, the dog is described as playing with a golf ball. Playing is an activity that typically takes place outdoors, especially for a dog as they need an open space to run around, chase, and play with toys. Being outside allows a dog to have the space and freedom to engage in such playful behavior. Second, the mention of a small wooden fence also points towards the dog being outside. Wooden fences are usually found on the perimeter of a property, serving as a boundary between the property and neighboring areas. These fences are common in outdoor scenarios such as backyards, parks, or similar settings, and play a part in defining the spatial layout of these environments. Third, the beach setting also strongly supports the hypothesis that the dog is outside. Beaches are clearly natural outdoor environments, and it is extremely unlikely that someone would recreate a beach environment indoors. A beach typically consists of sand, a body of water, and open space that stretches out to the horizon. The combination of these elements creates an ideal setting for the dog to freely play and explore. In conclusion, the information given in the premise – a dog playing with a golf ball in front of a small wooden fence on the beach – is enough to validate the hypothesis that the dog is outside. The activities mentioned, the presence of a fence, and the beach environment all collectively point towards an outdoor setting, providing strong evidence that the hypothesis is accurate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group being killed with Robert Redford's character, codename = Condor, being the one that was left. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, he gets Faye Dunaway's character involved involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey-dovey time.

Many types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them (e.g. NERVA) tested for spacecraft applications. can we use nuclear power to propel spaceships? Options: I. no II. yes","completion":"Option II: Yes Using nuclear power to propel spaceships is indeed a viable option that has drawn the attention of researchers, space agencies, and governments worldwide. Nuclear propulsion offers several advantages over conventional chemical propulsion, such as high efficiency, increased specific impulse, and the capability to perform long-duration missions. There are a few types of nuclear propulsion technologies for space applications that have been proposed and investigated over the years. Some of them are briefly described below: 1. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP): NTP systems utilize the heat generated by a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid (usually liquid hydrogen), which is then expelled through a nozzle to produce thrust. NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application) is one example of an NTP that underwent testing in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. NTP systems have the potential to be at least twice as efficient as chemical propulsion systems. 2. Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP): NEP systems use the electricity generated by a nuclear reactor to power an electric propulsion system, such as ion thrusters or Hall-effect thrusters. The electric propulsion system uses this electricity to accelerate charged particles, generating thrust with an extremely high specific impulse. While the overall thrust may not be as high as NTP systems, NEP systems can operate for much longer periods, making them suitable for deep space missions. 3. Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Rockets (BNTR): BNTR systems combine the features of NTP and NEP systems. This design allows the spacecraft to switch between modes depending on the mission's specific requirements. For instance, the NTP mode can be used for high-thrust maneuvers, while the NEP mode is utilized for more efficient, long-duration thrust. 4. Nuclear Pulse Propulsion (NPP): NPP systems rely on nuclear explosions to generate a propulsion force. Project Orion, developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s, is an example of an NPP study. While NPP systems have a high potential for efficiency and thrust, their practical implementation faces significant challenges, including the risks associated with nuclear explosions, material stresses, and potential political ramifications. 5. Fusion Propulsion: Fusion-based propulsion systems have also been proposed, but their development is currently at a nascent stage. Fusion propulsion relies on the energy released during the fusion of atoms to generate thrust. Compared to fission-based nuclear propulsion, fusion promises a much higher energy density, reduced radiation concerns, and an abundant fuel supply. However, the technology is yet to be demonstrated on Earth, let alone in space. In summary, nuclear propulsion technologies provide promising pathways for the development of efficient and long-lasting spacecraft propulsion systems. The main challenge lies in addressing various technical, safety, environmental, and political concerns associated with nuclear power. With continued research into advanced propulsion systems, it is conceivable that nuclear power can play a significant role in the future of human space exploration and interplanetary missions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Somebody really needs to have a word with Secretary of State Pompeo before he meets anybody in North Korea. He just referred to Kim Jong-un as “Chairman Un”. That’s like, I dunno, calling Winston Churchill “Prime Minister Spencer”pic.twitter.com/p0s2DRfuJc ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea released three American prisoners and handed them over to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, clearing a major obstacle to an unprecedented summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The men, who were freed after Pompeo met Kim, were on their way home aboard the chief U.S. diplomat’s plane, and Trump said he would greet them when they arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Thursday morning. “We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home,” the three said in a statement released by the State Department as their plane stopped over in Alaska. “We thank God, and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return. God Bless America, the greatest nation in the world.” The release, praised by the White House as a “gesture of goodwill,” appeared to signal an effort by Kim to set a more favorable tone for the summit and followed his recent pledge to suspend missile tests and shut a nuclear bomb test site. While Kim is giving up the last of his American detainees, whom North Korea has often used as bargaining chips, their return could also be aimed at pressuring Trump to make concessions as he tries to get Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arsenal, something it has not signaled a willingness to do. The release gave Trump a chance to tout a diplomatic achievement just a day after his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal drew heavy criticism from European allies and others. “I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “I appreciate Kim Jong Un doing this and allowing them to go,” Trump told reporters at the White House. Kim’s handover of the Americans was in response to an “official suggestion” from Trump, the North Korean state news agency KCNA said in its account of the talks with Pompeo. It was their second encounter in less than six weeks to prepare the first-ever meeting between sitting U.S. and North Korean leaders. Trump said agreement had been reached on a date and venue for the summit and details would be announced within three days. He ruled out the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, increasing the possibility the meeting could take place in Singapore, which he previously said was under consideration. FIRST STEP Kim said the summit would be an “excellent first step” toward an improved situation on the Korean peninsula, according to KCNA. Though tensions have eased recently, it was just months ago that fears of war were running high in the region. The family of Tony Kim, one of the freed prisoners, said in a statement: “We are very grateful for the release of our husband and father, Tony Kim, and the other two American detainees.” The fate of the three Korean-Americans had been among a number of delicate issues in the run-up to summit, which is being planned for late May or early June. As Pompeo returned to his Pyongyang hotel from a 90-minute meeting with Kim, the secretary of state crossed his fingers when asked by reporters if there was good news about the prisoners. A North Korean official came to the hotel shortly afterwards to inform Pompeo that Kim had granted them “amnesty,” according to a senior U.S. official present for the exchange. “You should make care that they do not make the same mistakes again,” the North Korean official was quoted as saying. “This was a hard decision.”The three, who walked without assistance to Pompeo’s plane and were seated near medical personnel, were in the air less than an hour after leaving custody. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shakes hands with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in this undated photo released on May 9, 2018 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang. KCNA/via REUTERS “They were happy to be with us on this plane, to be sure,” Pompeo told reporters during the flight. They are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong-chul, detained in 2015; Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017; and Kim Hak-song, who also taught at PUST and was detained last year. North Korean state media says they were arrested either for subversion or “hostile acts” against the government. ‘VERY PRODUCTIVE’ Speaking to reporters, Pompeo said his meetings in Pyongyang were “very productive.” The two sides agreed to meet again to finalize details of the summit, a U.S. official said. KCNA said Kim and Pompeo reached a “satisfactory consensus” on the issues they discussed, but provided no specifics. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while there was “reason for some optimism” about the summit, the U.S. troop presence in South Korea would not be part of initial negotiations. There was also no sign that Pompeo’s visit had cleared up the question of whether North Korea would be willing to bargain away nuclear missiles that might threaten the United States. Trump has credited his “maximum pressure” campaign for drawing North Korea to the table and has vowed to keep sanctions in place until Pyongyang takes concrete steps to denuclearize. But former spy chief Kim Yong Chul, director of North Korea’s United Front Department, said in a toast to Pompeo over lunch in Pyongyang: “We have perfected our nuclear capability. It is our policy to concentrate all efforts into economic progress ... This is not the result of sanctions that have been imposed from outside.” Slideshow (7 Images) Daniel Russel, until recently the most senior U.S. diplomat for Asia, said the prisoner release would reduce tensions, but was not a sign that peace was at hand. “We should hold off on awarding ourselves Nobel prizes. North Korea is stating clearly that what is on the table is merely tension reduction and possible ultimate global arms reduction. It is not talking about eliminating its own nuclear program.” Korea: a land divided - tmsnrt.rs/2KdXMcS ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"North Korea has released three American prisoners, a significant move ahead of the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

This indicates that the United States had more troops in Iraq in 2003 compared to the Kurdish militia. The primary objective of this coalition, led by the United States and the United Kingdom, was to enforce the American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq. After Hussein refused this demand, the coalition fought against the Iraqi army, and after about three weeks of combat, successfully removed Hussein and the Ba'ath Party from power.

Solve this problem.","completion":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this problem step-by-step like solving a puzzle: Problem: 49*l - 20 = 16*l + 13 First, we want to get all the \\"l\\" pieces (the numbers with \\"l\\") on one side of the equal sign and the other numbers on the other side. 1. We will take the 16*l from the right side and move it to the left. But, when we move it, we have to change its sign. Since it's positive (+) on the right, it will become negative (-) on the left. So, now our problem looks like this: 49*l - 16*l - 20 = 13 2. Next, let's combine the \\"l\\" pieces on the left side by subtracting 16*l from 49*l. Here's a little secret: when numbers have \\"l\\" attached to them (like 49*l and 16*l), you can combine them by just combining the numbers (49 and 16) and putting \\"l\\" back with the new number. 49*l - 16*l = 33*l Now our problem looks like this: 33*l - 20 = 13 3. Let's move the -20 from the left side to the right side. Remember the rule: when we move a number, we have to change its sign. So, the -20 will become a +20 when it goes to the right side. Now we have: 33*l = 13 + 20 4. Now, we just need to solve for \\"l.\\" We can start by adding the numbers on the right side. 13 + 20 = 33 So, our problem now looks like: 33*l = 33 5. To find \\"l,\\" we will now do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing! We need to divide both sides of the equal sign by 33 to get \\"l\\" by itself. 33*l / 33 = 33 / 33 This simplifies to: l = 1 And there you have it, little buddy!

Black Sabbath were an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history. The remaining two original members, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, began auditioning new singers for the band's next release. Samson's Nicky Moore, and Lone Star's John Sloman were considered and Iommi states in his autobiography that Michael Bolton auditioned for the band. The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982. While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath, pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name. The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums. Born Again (7 August 1983) was panned upon release by critics. Despite the negative reception of the album, it reached number four on the UK charts, and number 39 in the U.S. Even a decade after its release AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album \\"dreadful\\", noting that \\"Gillan's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom\\". Although he performed on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. \\"I fell apart with the idea of touring\\", Ward later said. \\"I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake.\\" Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 - '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the U.S. with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding the Deep Purple song \\"Smoke on the Water\\" to their set list. The tour in support of Born Again included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument. In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. As Geezer Butler later explained: We had Sharon Osbourne's dad, Don Arden, managing us. He came up with the idea of having the stage set be Stonehenge. He wrote the dimensions down and gave it to our tour manager. He wrote it down in metres but he meant to write it down in feet. The people who made it saw fifteen metres instead of fifteen feet. It was 45 feet high and it wouldn't fit on any stage anywhere so we just had to leave it in the storage area.

Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution.

Answer choices: - less water - dry - heat - clouds - drought - moisture - salinity - heat energy A:","completion":"Evaporation lowers moisture, which ultimately results in less water in the area where evaporation occurs. This can cause a number of related effects, such as making the environment drier, contributing to heat (since heat energy is transferred away during evaporation), and potentially leading to the formation of clouds when the evaporated water vapor condenses in the atmosphere. In some cases, increased evaporation can even contribute to drought conditions if it significantly reduces the amount of available water in an area. Moreover, evaporation can lead to an increase in salinity in bodies of water, as the salts and other dissolved substances are left behind when the water evaporates. So, evaporation mainly lowers: - Less water - Dry environment - Heat - Clouds (indirectly through condensation) - Drought (in some cases) - Salinity (in water bodies)"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides. Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly. Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","completion":"In order to determine which person's Geiger counter has less current running through it, it's important to understand the working principle of a Geiger counter and the relation between the counts per minute (CPM) and the current produced. A Geiger counter is a handheld device used for radiation detection and measurement. It consists of a Geiger-Müller (GM) tube, which is a gas-filled tube that indicates the presence of ionizing radiation, such as alpha, beta, and gamma particles. When ionizing radiation enters the GM tube, it ionizes the gas inside, creating charged particles. These charged particles then create an electrical discharge or pulse, which is amplified and can be heard as clicks or beeps. The rate at which the Geiger counter clicks, or the counts per minute (CPM), indicates the level of radiation present in the area. A higher CPM implies a higher level of radiation, and therefore, a higher amount of ionizing particles detected by the GM tube. Now, let's consider the situation with Robert and Thomas: Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly near the Ferris wheel, which indicates a lower CPM and suggests that there is less radiation in that area. This results in fewer gas ionizations and electrical pulses inside the GM tube over time. In contrast, Thomas's Geiger counter clicks rapidly near the merry-go-round, which signifies a higher CPM and suggests that there is higher radiation in that area. Consequently, there will be more ionizations and electrical pulses occurring in the GM tube over time. Since the current produced is directly proportional to the number of ionizations and electrical pulses, we can deduce the following: - A higher CPM correlates to more ionizations and electrical pulses, which results in a higher current running through the Geiger counter. - A lower CPM correlates to fewer ionizations and electrical pulses, which results in a lower current running through the Geiger counter. Based on the information provided, Robert's Geiger counter at the Ferris wheel is clicking slowly, indicating a lower CPM and hence, less current running through it. Thomas's Geiger counter, however, is clicking rapidly near the merry-go-round, signifying a higher CPM and more current running through his device. So, to answer the question, Robert's Geiger counter has less current running through it compared to Thomas's Geiger counter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable.

He liked telling them no, especially when it was the truth. Does the clinic Ray works at receive government funding? - not enough information - Yes - Only insurance payments - Clients never pay A:","completion":"There isn't enough information provided in the passage to precisely determine whether the clinic Ray works at receives government funding. The primary focus of the passage is on the challenges that clinics face when treating uninsured and uninsurable patients, who often do not pay for the services they receive, leaving the clinic with financial difficulties. While it is clear that the clinic deals with payment issues, primarily receiving income from insurance payments and the small percentage of clients who pay, it doesn't explicitly state if any government funding is provided to the clinic. It is possible that the clinic could be receiving some form of government financial assistance, but based on the information given, this cannot be confirmed. The passage portrays a system where the hospital and the clinic are interconnected in managing these challenging patients, but both struggle to find financial stability because of patients not paying or maintaining their treatments. Ray's frustrations stem from the limited resources available to deal with this difficult reality and from the hospital's willingness to transfer the burden to the clinic. As a result, he doesn't feel enthusiasm for helping uninsured and uninsurable clients, especially when he knows how the situation tends to pan out. In conclusion, the passage does not provide sufficient information to confirm whether the clinic Ray works at receives government funding or not.

Once we have the side length, we can compute the area. Arya is traveling at 20 km/hr, and she takes 90 minutes to travel from point A to point C. First, let's convert the time into hours: 90 minutes = 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season.

In spite of our late arrival, Joan, my wife's sister, decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping.

It was here that he became interested in music and started his career in the entertainment industry early on. Johnston first made a name for himself as a successful session musician and background vocalist. He joined The Beach Boys in 1965, providing vocals, bass, and key instruments on some of their defining albums, such as \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"The Smile Sessions.\\" Johnston's songwriting skills came to the forefront when he wrote \\"I Write the Songs.\\" The song was first recorded by The Captain & Tennille, an American pop music duo, for their album \\"Love Will Keep Us Together.\\" It was later released by David Cassidy in 1975, but neither of these versions managed to make a significant impact on the charts. Barry Manilow, a popular American singer-songwriter and producer, decided to record \\"I Write the Songs\\" for his album \\"Tryin' to Get the Feeling.\\" Released in 1975, the song became a chart-topping hit in 1976, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on January 17, 1976, and holding that position for a week. With Manilow's mesmerizing vocals and exceptional arrangement, the song became an instant fan favorite, earning a Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1977. So, while Barry Manilow is the artist most commonly associated with \\"I Write the Songs\\" due to the song's significant success, it was Bruce Johnston, The Beach Boys band member, who actually wrote and composed the iconic hit. This is a testament to Johnston's prowess as a songwriter, as well as Manilow's immense talent in arranging and performing the song in a way that brought it to the forefront of popular music during that era."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A:","completion":"Yes Explanation: To determine if the two sentences agree or disagree, we need to look at the definition of the task and break down the content of each sentence. Here, the main idea is to see if the two statements describe a similar situation or not. Sentence 1 states: \\"One a week, every week,\\" which means something is happening on a weekly basis. It also states \\"getting a little better each time,\\" implying an improvement in the situation with each instance. Sentence 2 also talks about maintaining visits to a clinic (which could possibly mean they occur on a regular basis) and states that those visits \\"got easier each time,\\" which implies a similar improvement with each visit like in Sentence 1.

Information: - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Criticism of religion is criticism of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of religion, including its political and social implications. - Moloch , also known as Molech , Molekh , Molok , Molek , Moloc , Melech , Milcom , or Molcom ( representing Semitic m - l - k , a Semitic root meaning \`\` king '' ) is the name of an ancient type of sacrifice or a god , who was first worshiped in Ammon . Moloch was either practised ( as a sacrifice ) or worshipped ( as a god ) by the Canaanites , Phoenicians , and related cultures in North Africa and the Levant . As a god worshiped by the Phoenicians and Canaanites , Moloch had associations with a particular kind of propitiatory child sacrifice by parents . Moloch figures in the Book of Deuteronomy and in the Book of Leviticus as a forbidden form of idolatry ( Leviticus 18:21 : \`\` And thou shalt not let any of thy seeds ( children ) pass through the fire to Moloch '' ) . In the Old Testament , Gehenna was a valley by Jerusalem , where followers of various Baalim and Canaanite gods , including Moloch , sacrificed their children by fire ( 2 Chr . 28:3 , 33:6 ; Jer . 7:31 , 19:2 -- 6 ) . Moloch has been used figuratively in English literature from John Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) to Allen Ginsberg 's \`\` Howl '' ( 1955 ) , to refer to a person or thing demanding or requiring a very costly sacrifice . - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving. - Biologically, a child (plural: children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty. The legal definition of \\"child\\" generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority. - Human sacrifice is the act of killing one or more human beings, usually as an offering to a deity, as part of a ritual. Human sacrifice has been practiced in various cultures throughout history. Victims were typically ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease gods, spirits or the deceased, for example as a propitiatory offering or as a retainer sacrifice when a king's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life. Closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting. - Child sacrifice is the ritualistic killing of children in order to please, propitiate or force a god or supernatural beings in order to achieve a desired result. As such, it is a form of human sacrifice. The practice has received considerable opposition throughout history, and it has often become a target for those engaged in criticism of religion. Child sacrifice is thought to be an extreme extension of the idea that, the more important the object of sacrifice, the more devout the person giving it up is. - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance.

Q:- A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process might be: The ecosystem experiences a period of recovery and regeneration as the forest gradually regrows, and the surviving animals and plants repopulate the area, restoring the balance of the ecosystem over time. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. After the fire is extinguished or burns out, the burnt forest is left with little to no vegetation, which means there is limited food and shelter available for the surviving animals. 2. While the plants that provide food are gone initially, some plant species might have fire-resistant seeds or root structures that enable them to grow again after the fire. 3. As the plants and vegetation begin to regrow, the ecosystem will gradually start to recover. This process may take months, years, or even decades, depending on the severity of the fire and the specific ecosystem. 4. As the plants and trees return, so do the insects, birds, and other animals that rely on them for food and shelter. This process may be slow as the surviving animals need to repopulate the area and new generations need to be born in the recovering ecosystem. 5. Eventually, the ecosystem will reach a new state of balance, where the populations of animals and plants are stable and have adapted to the post-fire conditions and regrowth.

Q:Information: - The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas. - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty . A Democrat from Cole County , Hanson served on an interim basis in 1994 from the time of Moriarty 's removal from office by the Missouri Supreme Court following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives until Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Bekki Cook to serve until the following scheduled election for the office . - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States. - Judith K. Moriarty (born February 2, 1942) is an American politician from Missouri, first with the Democratic Party, switching to the Libertarian Party in 2005. She was the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State. - The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30 north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. However, the term is locally used to refer to the entire southeastern lowlands of Missouri located within the Mississippi Embayment, which includes parts of Butler, Mississippi, Ripley, Scott, Stoddard and extreme southern portions of Cape Girardeau and Bollinger counties.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: The story does not say how much this new procedure costs or compare it with existing treatments for patients who don’t respond to medication. Deep brain stimulation, the current treatment standard, can run anywhere from 30,000 to 70,000, according to various online cost estimates. There also may be additional costs incurred by those patients who have adverse effects. The story is long on description but short on numbers. Saying the treatment “has had an immense impact on patients’ lives,” the story devotes quite a bit of print along with video footage to show rapid functional and quality-of-life improvements experienced by patients, focusing on one women who said her tremor “has almost disappeared” since she had the procedure in June. Video showing this patient before and after treatment–including her attempts to write her name, trace a spiral and pour water from one cup to another–do a great job of conveying the improvements. This is terrific news for this woman, but we’re not told how representative her experience is of overall outcomes. Is she a best-case scenario? Middle of the road? There are also inspiring quotes from a researcher, including a description of the “remarkable moment” patients experience when they realized the tremor has subsided. “They can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public. So it really is extraordinarily helpful for people,” he says. In terms of study data, the story says researchers “found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly” in patients who underwent the treatment as well as reported improvements in quality of life. But there are no figures. In fact, according to the study, patients experienced a 47 percent improvement in tremor scores, dropping from 18.1 points on a 32-point scale at baseline to 9.6 points three months after the procedure. That data should have been included. Also, the story should have spelled out that 56 patients received the treatment, versus 20 who experienced a fake procedure. Also worth pointing out: We don’t know the meaning or clinical significance of a reduction of this magnitude in the total score. The story addresses adverse effects, and that’s sufficient for a Satisfactory rating. We do wish the story had quantified the harms that were measured in the study. The fourth paragraph says the procedure “brings lasting side effects in some patients” and later the story quotes a physician who is not involved in the research as saying, “It’s a pretty high incidence of side effects.” But nowhere do exact numbers appear. Rather than citing data from the study, the story quotes the physician as saying that “over a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia,” or numbness. This information isn’t very useful because the story does not explain when these rates were measured. According to the study, three months after the procedure 36% of patients had gait disturbance and 38% had numbness. After 12 months, the numbers dropped, to 9 percent and 14 percent respectively. Also worth mentioning is that one patient was reported to have permanent diminished sensation of the dominant thumb and index figure, which was categorized as a serious adverse event. That did not appear in the story. The story clearly spells out that there isn’t data on the long-term efficacy of this procedure, and that more study is needed, so we’ll give this a barely passing Satisfactory. Several important study limitations were not included in the story, such as the fact that the treatment did not provide significant improvement for some types of tremors, and the treatment is not appropriate for people who are unwilling or unable to undergo an MRI. We’re also not told that the sham group was only followed for 3 months, while the experimental group was followed for a year. This is not usually recommended in clinical trials and both groups should be followed for the same length of time. The story cites a figure from the International Essential Tremor Foundation, an advocacy group, that an estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition. However, a 2014 analysis of existing research put the number of cases at around 7 million as of 2012, or about 2.2% of the U.S. population. While this may not qualify as disease mongering, the story could have pointed out that the exact number of cases isn’t clear. Also, the story should have noted that not all people with essential tremor have symptoms severe enough to require treatment. The story only fulfills part of our criteria. It does use one independent source, a physician who was not involved in the study. It also accurately reports the trial’s funding sources: InSightec, which developed the device; along with Focused Ultrasound Foundation, which is funded by device makers and philanthropic organizations; and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation, an Israel-U.S. government partnership that receives corporate support. However, the story falls short because it does not report the fact that nine of the study authors reported conflicts of interest, with most receiving financial compensation of some sort from device makers in the field. Lead researcher G. Rees Cosgrove, M.D. who is quoted in the story, reported receiving consulting fees from InSightec. The story states, “Doctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don’t work well for all patients.” That’s true, and so we’ll give this a Satisfactory rating for at least mentioning alternatives. But it should be noted that other procedural treatment options were not compared or even mentioned in the story and received only a brief mention in one of the videos. The current standard for tremor patients who don’t respond to medication is deep-brain stimulation, in which a probe connected to a pacemaker is implanted in the thalamus to suppress the tremors. Gamma Knife thalamotomy, which delivers precise doses of radiation to the thalamus, is also considered to be a safe and effective therapy for patients who don’t respond to medication. Also, some patients have mild symptoms that can be treated with relaxation techniques and the avoidance of triggers such as caffeine. The story states that the device was approved by the FDA in July. The story could have done readers a service by giving a sense of how many medical centers around the country are geared up to perform the procedure, or will be soon. This is indeed a new treatment option for essential tremor, though the story may leave readers with the false impression that the concept of killing off neurons in the thalamus is new. Rather, it’s the use of focused ultrasound to destroy brain tissue, rather than a probe inserted in the brain, that constitutes an advance. The story does not appear to rely solely on the news release, which we also reviewed. Claim: New treatment offers some hope for an unshakable tremor Student:","completion":"The paragraph supports the claim that a new treatment offers hope for an unshakable tremor by providing various pieces of evidence. It mentions the significant reduction in the severity of essential tremor and improvements in the quality of life experienced by patients who underwent the treatment. The paragraph also presents the story of one woman whose tremor almost disappeared after the procedure, supported by video footage illustrating her impressive improvements. Furthermore, it includes a researcher's quotes describing the \\"remarkable moment\\" patients realize their tremor has subsided, and how they can regain control over their daily activities. However, the paragraph also points out that there are limitations and missing data in the story. The exact magnitude and clinical significance of the reported reduction in total tremor score are not thoroughly explained. Moreover, there is no information about how representative the presented patient's experience is of the overall outcomes, nor are the adverse effects precisely quantified. While the paragraph demonstrates that the new treatment does offer hope for patients with unshakable tremors, it also emphasizes the need for more comprehensive data and study to support the claim fully."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, I would opt for option (B) - Use a calculator to scale it to the correct size. Step 2: Identify the required dimensions. Determine the desired size for the lamp, which may depend on factors such as available space, purpose of the lamp, and design preferences. Step 3: Measure the current dimensions of the lamp. Using a measuring tape or ruler, measure the lamp's dimensions, such as height, width, and depth. Note down these measurements. Step 4: Calculate the scale factor. Determine the scale factor needed to achieve the desired dimensions. To do this, divide the desired dimension by the current dimension. For example, if the current height is 10 inches, and the desired height is 15 inches, the scale factor would be 1.5 (15/10 = 1.5). Step 5: Apply the scale factor to other dimensions. Multiply the scale factor with the other dimensions (width and depth) to get the new dimensions for the lamp. For example, if the current width is 5 inches, the new width would be 7.5 inches (5 inches x 1.5 = 7.5 inches). Step 6: Verify the new dimensions. Double-check the new dimensions to ensure they meet the initial requirements. If not, adjust the scale factor and repeat the calculations.

The process this year took longer than the investigation last year, because the OPTIONS: 1). process was less involved.; 2). investigation was less involved.;","completion":"The process this year took longer than the investigation last year, because the investigation was less involved. There are several factors that contributed to this difference in duration and complexity. First, the scope of the investigation last year was narrower, which allowed the team to focus more on specific issues and work more efficiently overall. With a smaller range of topics to cover, the investigators were able to dedicate more time to each individual issue and reach conclusions sooner. Secondly, the team that conducted the investigation last year had more experience working together, resulting in better communication, smoother collaboration, and overall faster progress. The team this year, on the other hand, included several new members who needed time to familiarize themselves with the procedures and working dynamics, eventually slowing down the process. The investigation last year also had fewer stakeholders involved. This simplified the decision-making process, since there were less opinions to consider and address. In contrast, this year's process had multiple stakeholders with differing interests, which led to more deliberation and the need to reach a consensus, thus extending the duration of the investigation. Another contributing factor to the longer process this year was the amount of evidence that needed to be reviewed and analyzed. Compared to last year's investigation, there was significantly more documentation, testimonies, and data to process this year, requiring an extensive amount of time to ensure a thorough analysis. Lastly, this year's complexity may have also been heightened by additional regulatory and compliance requirements that were not present last year. These new regulations required the investigators to take additional steps to ensure that they met the necessary legal standards, adding time and effort to the process. In summary, the reason this year's process took longer than the investigation last year is primarily due to the latter being less involved. The narrower scope, more experienced team, fewer stakeholders, less evidence to analyze, and lack of additional regulatory requirements all contributed to the quicker completion of last year's investigation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 42-year-old is so worried that he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand artificial intelligence, or","completion":"AI, has indeed made significant strides in development over the past few years, leading to remarkable innovations in various fields, including self-driving cars, healthcare, and the automation of several jobs. However, Musk's concerns about the potential risks that the rapid advancements in AI technology might pose to humanity should not be taken lightly. The Tesla-founder's statement echoes the sentiments expressed by several scientists and tech experts, who have previously called for the responsible development and governance of AI to prevent negative outcomes. As per Musk, a 'Terminator-like' scenario could become a reality if research into artificial intelligence is left unchecked and without any regulations. This could lead to the rise of autonomous machines, which operate without human intervention, potentially causing widespread unemployment or even conflicts between humans and intelligent machines. To prevent such a dystopian future, Musk has taken it upon himself to invest in AI companies, with the primary objective of monitoring the technology's progress and ensuring that it remains beneficial and well-controlled. Rather than seeking monetary gains, Musk wants to maintain a close watch on AI research to prevent any unintended and catastrophic consequences. One way for Musk and the broader scientific community to address AI safety concerns is by promoting transparency and collaboration among researchers, developers, and regulators. This includes the establishment of a global set of guidelines and ethical standards to which all AI researchers and developers should adhere, as well as incentives for complying with such principles. Furthermore, tech giants and research institutions should continue funding AI safety research. By understanding the potential risks of AI technology, researchers can develop ways to mitigate them and create a more secure foundation for the field's future innovations. In addition to these preventive measures, various stakeholders – including governments, policymakers, and tech companies – need to come together to voice their concerns and actively participate in discussions on AI regulation, oversight, and safety policies. By fostering international cooperation, a global consensus can be reached on striking the right balance between AI innovation and ensuring the responsible management of this transformative technology. In conclusion, while Elon Musk's concerns about a potential 'Terminator-like' scenario emerging from AI research are valid, there are ways to address these risks through collaboration, transparency, and responsible governance of AI technology. By investing in AI companies, with a focus on fostering AI safety, Musk is taking proactive measures to prevent the uncontrollable rise of artificial intelligence. It is now upon the global community of stakeholders, including researchers, regulators, and policymakers, to come together to ensure a safer and more reliable future powered by AI."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.

One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The old adage that 'time is like a river', suggesting that we move through it like a ship sailing on water, may be wrong. A new theory claims that time does not move forward, but rather, everything in time is ever-present. According to the theory, if we were to ‘look down’ upon the universe, we would see time spread out in all directions, just as we see space at the moment. Scroll down for video. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of philosophy has presented a new theory of time. Dr Bradford Skow says the idea that time flows like a river (stock image shown) is not necessarily correct. Instead he claims space-time is a 'block universe' where the past, present and future all exist together. The intriguing theory was put forward by Dr Bradford Skow, an associated professor of philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In his new book, Objective Becoming, he examines some of the theories that have been postulated to explain time. ‘When you ask people, “Tell me about the passage of time,” they usually make a metaphor,’ he said. In 1927 British astronomer Arthur Eddington first devised the ‘one-way direction’ or ‘asymmetry ‘ of time. He said that by studying the organisation of matter, it was possible to make a 4D map of the universe. The so-called ‘arrow of time’ supposedly points to a move spread out and ‘random’ future, toward which everything is moving. This is also known as entropy, which tends to increase with time. Entropy, a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, will increase as energy dissipates and matter and energy disperse. This means that entropy will always increase in the universe. Some say this may lead to a ‘heat death’ future where everything is spread so thinly that nothing can exist any more – a scenario famously postulated in Isaac Asimov’s short story The Last Question. However, owing to the law of gravity, some think such a future is not a possibility. And Dr Skow thinks the 'arrow of time' theory itself is not necessarily correct. ‘They say time flows like a river, or we move through time like a ship sailing through the sea.’ Another theory states that the present is a ‘spotlight’ that moves from the past to the future, with us being located in the spotlight as it moves forward. Dr Skow, however, said he ‘wouldn’t want to believe in that unless I saw good arguments for it.’ Rather, he favours a theory known as the ‘block universe’, which states that the past, present and future already exist. Dr Skow said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead, they exist in different parts of space-time. ‘The block universe theory says you’re spread out in time, something like the way you’re spread out in space,' Dr Skow said. ‘We’re not located at a single time.’ Instead he says we are in a 'temporarily scattered' condition. He asserts that our passage through space-time is not like a spotlight - and the experiences you had yesterday, last week, or even years ago are all real. But he says time travel between the different times is not possible, as we are now in a different part of space-time. Dr Skow (pictured) said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead, they exist in different parts of spacetime. ‘The block universe theory says you’re spread out in time, something like the way you’re spread out in space,' he said. ‘We’re not located at a single time’ If we were to look down upon the universe, we would see time spread out, said Dr Skow. But he adds the present is not a 'spotlight' in time - but rather we are in a 'temporally scattered' condition. His theory follows another postulated by scientists back in December. They proposed that at the moment of the Big Bang, a 'mirror universe' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards through time. The radical theory was proposed by Dr Julian Barbour of College Farm in the UK, Dr Tim Koslowski of the University of New Brunswick in Canada and Dr Flavio Mercati of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, also in Canada. Their research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘arrow of time’ - which is the concept that time is ‘symmetric’ and everything moves forwards. They say that at the time of the Big Bang not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time, but opposite to each other. His theory follows another postulated by scientists back in December. They proposed that at the moment of the Big Bang (illustrated), a 'mirror universe' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards. This universe would not be exactly the same as ours, though; it would have evolved and changed in its own way, completely separate to our own. However, it would be subject to the same laws of physics, so it would likely have planets, stars and galaxies just like in our version of the cosmos. And Dr Barbour told MailOnline the theory could open up a new way to think about the Big Bang. ‘At the moment when people talk about the Big Bang, they more or less throw their hands up in despair and say they can’t say what happened,' he said. ‘Now our work is beginning to suggest we can actually say more than people thought.’ Which theory of time proves to be correct, though - Dr Skow's block universe, the mirror universe or perhaps another - remains to be seen.

His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practising Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Bass guitarist Larry Graham and the late songwriter Teenie Hodges are his paternal uncles. Drake's mother, Sandi Graham (nee Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release. On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single \\"Over\\", peaking at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, \\"Find Your Love\\", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, \\"care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image].\\" The third single and fourth singles, \\"Miss Me\\" and \\"Fancy\\" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri. Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z. It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois.

Be it from the wood of a picnic table or the thorns of a rosebush, the annoyance of a splinter should never be underestimated. Successfully removing a splinter is essential to avoid infection and alleviate discomfort. This article examines six proven methods to safely and gently remove splinters at home. 1. Examine the Splinter The first step in removing a splinter is to examine it closely. Locate the splinter with proper lighting and determine the angle at which it entered the skin. Positioning your hand close and personal with the affected area allows you greater control and precision in the removal process. Take note of the size and depth of the splinter to decide on the best technique for removal. For larger splinters or those embedded deep in the skin, it may be necessary to consult with a healthcare professional. 2. Using Tape to Gently Pull the Splinter Out For smaller, shallower splinters, using a piece of tape can help gently pull the splinter out of the skin. Clear adhesive tape is preferable for easy visualization of the splinter. Gently press the tape onto the affected area, ensuring that the sticky side makes contact with the protruding end of the splinter. Slowly peel away the tape, watching as the splinter comes out with it. Following this, clean the area with soap and water to prevent infection. 3. Trying Glue to Get the Splinter Out If the tape doesn't work, using a small amount of glue is another option. Apply a thin layer of white school glue or wood glue to the area, making sure to cover the entire splinter. Allow the glue to dry completely. Then, gently peel the glue off the skin, and the splinter should come along with it. Keep in mind that this method is not recommended for deep splinters or those in sensitive areas. 4. Applying Baking Soda to Get the Splinter Out Baking soda paste is an effective home remedy that can be used with small, stubborn splinters. Combine baking soda with water until it forms a thick paste. Apply the paste to the affected area and cover it with a bandage or cloth. Leave it to rest for approximately 24 hours before removing the bandage. This process allows the baking soda to soften the skin and force the splinter to the surface, making it easier to remove with tweezers or your fingers. As always, clean the area after removal. 5. Using Ichthammol Ointment to Remove the Splinter Ichthammol ointment, also known as black drawing salve, is a traditional remedy for extracting splinters and other foreign objects from the skin. Apply a small amount of the ointment to the splintered area and cover it with a band-aid or gauze. Let it sit for several hours, and then remove the bandage. The splinter should have worked its way to the surface or become easier to remove. Use alcohol to sanitize the area afterwards. 6. Applying Epsom Salts to the Splinter Epsom salts are a versatile remedy, particularly effective in drawing out splinters embedded in the skin. Mix a small amount of Epsom salts with water to create a paste. Apply the paste directly to the splinter area and cover it with a bandage. Leave it on for a few hours and then check to see if the splinter has risen to the surface. Once visible, use clean tweezers to remove the splinter and follow up with proper wound cleaning techniques. Conclusion Splinters can be unpleasant, but with these six methods in your at-home toolkit, you will be well-prepared to safely and effectively extract them. Pay attention to how your body reacts to each technique and choose the one that suits you best. Remember, if a splinter seems too deep or causes excessive pain, consult a healthcare professional. It is always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Input: Question: In what years did television series that inspired the spin-off film \\"The Frighteners\\" air? Passage:Peter Jackson and partner/co-writer Fran Walsh conceived the idea for The Frighteners in 1992, during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Together, they wrote a three-page film treatment and sent it to their talent agent in Hollywood. Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt (which he helped produce). Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993. The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for The Frighteners in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided The Frighteners would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures.

By JACK MATHEWS DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday, March 29th 2002, 1:71AM NO SUCH THING. With Robert John Burke, Sarah Polley, Helen Mirren, Julie Christie. Written and directed by Hal Hartley. Running time: 101 mins. At the Angelika. Rated R: Language and brief violence. 1 1/2 stars Long Island auteur Hal Hartley, whose quirky films play to an acquired taste I have yet to acquire, turns his ironic eye on the romantic horror genre with \\"No Such Thing,\\" a \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" knockoff that blends in some broad satirical notes about global dyspepsia and media madness. Sarah Polley, the 23-year-old Canadian actress whose work in such art-house hits as \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" and \\"The Claim\\" has made her the Queen of the Unseen, plays Beatrice, a New York TV gofer who talks her cynical network news boss (Helen Mirren) into letting her investigate the apparent murders of a film crew by a monster dwelling on the coast of Iceland. En route, Beatrice, whose name alternately means \\"voyager,\\" \\"blessed\\" and \\"bringer of joy,\\" becomes the sole survivor of a plane crash. It's a miraculous event that envelops her in an aura of invincibility just in time for her meeting with the immortal monster (Robert John Burke), a creature with the body of a man, the face of a horned toad and the fiery bellow of a dragon. In less time than one would imagine, Beatrice charms the ill-tempered, alcoholic and curiously articulate creature, learns of his earnest desire to end his life as a figment of man's imagination and brings him back to New York, where she becomes the darling of the media world and he a poor man's King Kong. The monster, tamed by his promise of nonviolence to Beatrice, is prodded by scientists, beaten by mobs and subjected to humiliating mistreatment by punks, while she enjoys the fruits of her sudden fame. No wonder the monster cops such an attitude about mankind. Ultimately, Beatrice's conscience will be stirred back to life, and Iceland (which had a hand in the film's financing) will be revisited. Hartley says he was going for a kind of modern \\"Mothra\\" thing with his monster, and the creature is pretty cool-looking. But its effects are even cheesier than in Japanese horror movies. The film's pace is just plain wacky, moving with the haste of a receding glacier most of the time, but then jumping ahead as if Hartley hit the gas on a time machine. The saving grace, if it amounts to that, is the humor built into the monster, and Burke's deadpan playing of it. Elsewhere, one can only wonder how Mirren, the gemstone of \\"Gosford Park,\\" and Julie Christie, in the tossed-off role of Beatrice's nurse, came to this. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article is a review of the film \\"No Such Thing,\\" directed by Hal Hartley, a romantic horror movie inspired by \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" It stars Sarah Polley as Beatrice, a TV gofer who investigates the murder of a film crew in Iceland only to find a creature (played by Robert John Burke) with a desire to end its existence. The film, according to the critic, has a wacky pace and cheesy effects but is somewhat redeemed by Burke's deadpan performance as the monster. The critic also questions the involvement of Helen Mirren and Julie Christie, considering their talent and previous acclaimed roles. The film is rated 1 1/2 stars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Phillipe wanted to use a perfume but the nozzle was blocked because of dirt. Luckily he could clean the A. dirt out of it.. B. nozzle out of it..","completion":"A. Dirt out of it. Phillipe had always taken great care of his possessions, and it was to his great dismay that he discovered the nozzle of his favorite perfume bottle was blocked. He had received the perfume, which contained a subtle and intricate blend of sandalwood, citrus, and earthy undertones, as a gift from his long-lost friend Terry, who was nothing short of a connoisseur in the field of fragrances. The perfume had become Phillipe’s signature scent, garnering him compliments whenever he wore it. Now faced with the task of cleaning the stubborn dirt obstructing the nozzle, Phillipe gathered his materials. He compiled a small box of tools, including cotton swabs, rubbing alcohol, and a magnifying glass. He set up his workspace on an immaculate white tablecloth in his moonlit kitchen, ready to repair his precious perfume bottle. He spent the first few moments examining the blockage closely, using the magnifying glass to get a better look at the minuscule particles of dirt that caused the problem. He quickly discovered that the dirt had formed a thick crust, adhering to the walls of the nozzle with a remarkable tenacity, thus preventing it from performing its intended function. Phillipe knew that he had to tread lightly, as too much pressure could potentially damage the delicate nozzle or the mechanisms within the perfume bottle, leaving them both beyond repair. So, he decided to use a gentle, strategic approach, instead. With great attention to detail, he devised a plan that began with softening the blockage by soaking a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and diligently dabbing it on the dirt. This would not only loosen the crust but also sterilize the nozzle, ensuring no additional contamination to the perfume itself. As he worked to remove the dirt, Phillipe couldn't help but reminisce about the times he and Terry spent together, traveling the world and sampling exotic fragrances on their quests. It was those shared experiences that had solidified their bond and engrained a deep appreciation for fine scents into Phillipe's soul. With the dirt beginning to dissolve, Phillipe felt a sense of satisfaction and hope that soon, he could use his favorite perfume once again. He grabbed a fresh cotton swab and swirled it inside the nozzle, gently dislodging the softened dirt and watching the particles detach and fall away. He repeated this process until the pathway was clear and free from obstruction. Phillipe held his breath as he tested the perfume bottle, pressing the nozzle and releasing a perfect, fine mist of the unforgettable scent. The relief washed over him, knowing that he had restored his perfume bottle to its former glory, evoking memories of past journeys shared with Terry. Adorning himself in the revitalized fragrance, Phillipe couldn't help but feel a renewed connection to his dear friend and the memories of their adventures. Grateful for the chance to clean the dirt out of his perfume nozzle, and even more so for the stories it held, Phillipe vowed to continue upholding the legacies of their friendship and shared appreciation for the art of perfume. And as the scent enveloped him, Phillipe knew that Terry would be proud."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Explicație detaliată și pe termen lung: Textul original în limba engleză menționează că, dacă autoritățile din Haiti nu iau decizii majore, precum achiziționarea obligatorie, atunci nu se va putea realiza curățarea celor mii de tone de moloz care blochează procesul de reconstrucție. În traducerea și în explicarea detaliată în limba română, am menționat același punct de vedere. Autoritățile haitiene trebuie să ia măsuri importante și să ia în considerare achiziționarea obligatorie pentru a debloca procesul de reconstrucție. Acest lucru este o condiție necesară pentru ca molozul să poată fi eliminat și pentru a permite reînnoirea infrastructurii și a clădirilor afectate. Achiziționarea obligatorie este un instrument folosit de guverne pentru a prelua controlul asupra unei anumite proprietăți sau a unor bunuri pentru un scop public sau în favoarea comunității. În acest caz, ar putea fi utilizată pentru a facilita accesul la zonele afectate de moloz și pentru a permite curățarea și reconstrucția necesară. De asemenea, este important de menționat că procesul de reconstrucție înseamnă renașterea și regenerarea zonei respective, dar nu numai în ceea ce priveșте infrastructura fizică, ci și în ceea ce privește comunitatea, economia și viața cotidiană. Prin îndepărtarea obstacolelor majore, cum ar fi molozul, autoritățile haitiene ar putea facilita revenirea la normal a vieții sociale și economice, care la rândul său ar putea contribui la dezvoltarea și creșterea rezilienței comunității în fața unor evenimente similare în viitor. În concluzie, se subliniază importanța luării unor decizii majore pentru a facilita procesul de reconstrucție, iar una dintre aceste măsuri ar putea fi achiziționarea obligatorie.

Is \\"Notably, the most broadly influential innovation of 20th-century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products, which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty.\\" a good answer to the question \\"When was the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts published?\\"","completion":"No, the provided statement does not directly answer the question \\"When was the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts published?\\" Instead, it discusses the broad influence of strict liability for defective products, which originated from judicial interpretations of warranty laws. To adequately address the question, you should provide information about the publication and adoption of Section 402A. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question would be: The Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts was published in 1965 by the American Law Institute (ALI). This particular section presented a significant shift in product liability law by introducing the principle of strict liability for defective products. Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. (59 Cal. 2d 57; 1963), a landmark California Supreme Court case decided prior to publication of the rule, is often cited as the catalyst for this legal development. In the Greenman case, the plaintiff was injured while using a power tool that had been manufactured by Yuba Power Products. He filed a complaint on the grounds that the tool was defective and unreasonably dangerous, causing his injury. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that the manufacturer should be held strictly liable for any injuries resulting from their defective product, regardless of any negligence or contractual relationships. Chief Justice Traynor, who authored the majority opinion, set the foundation for Section 402A by emphasizing the importance of placing the burden of product defects on the manufacturer. This concept, the \\"Greenman rule,\\" recognizes that the manufacturer is better equipped to bear the costs and risks associated with defective products than the consumer and encourages businesses to invest in the production of safer products. When the Restatement (Second) of Torts was published in 1965, Section 402A adopted the Greenman rule, providing a standard for product liability law. The section states that a seller, engaged in the business of selling such a product, is liable for harm caused to the consumer or their property if the defective product is unreasonably dangerous and the user is unaware of the danger. This provision applies even if the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product, and if the user should have been able to discover the defect. In summary, the Greenman rule, as encapsulated in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, was published in 1965. This was a direct result of the 1963 California Supreme Court decision in Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., which led to the introduction and eventual widespread adoption of the principle of strict liability for defective products in American tort law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The vacancy is 10. Should I attend SSB for SSC(T) - 47? After how many days did is the merit list declared after conducting the SSB interview?","completion":"While the two questions you've asked are related, they are not the same and address different aspects of the selection process for the Indian Army's Technical Graduate Course (TGC) and the Short Service Commission Technical (SSC-T). The first question seeks advice on whether you should attend the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47, given that you have already been recommended by SSB Bangalore for TGC-123 with a merit rank of 24 and a vacancy of 10. Before answering this question, let's briefly discuss TGC and SSC(T) courses. Both TGC and SSC(T) are technical entries for engineering graduates in the Indian Army. The primary difference between the two lies in their commission type and service duration. TGC is a Permanent Commission (PC), whereas SSC(T) is a Short Service Commission (SSC), lasting for 10 years and extendable up to 14 years. My advice based on the information provided leans toward attending the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47. Here's why: 1. Competitive Merit Rank: Your merit rank for TGC-123 is 24, and the vacancy is 10. This suggests that your chances of being selected for TGC-123 may be slim due to the limited number of available slots. 2. Alternative Opportunity: By attending the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47, you are providing yourself with an alternative opportunity to join the Indian Army as a technical officer. Success in the SSC(T)-47 interview would increase your chances of being commissioned, even if you aren't selected for TGC-123. 3. Diversifying Options: Attending the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47 can help you better understand the selection process and improve your overall performance in SSB interviews. This experience can be valuable if you consider other commissioning avenues in the future. The second question is focused on the timeframe for the declaration of the merit list after the SSB interview. Typically, the merit list for the SSB interview is declared within 60 to 90 days after the conclusion of all the SSB interviews across different centers. However, this timeframe can vary based on the number of candidates, administrative processes, and other factors. It's essential to regularly check the official Indian Army website (joinindianarmy.nic.in) for updates on the merit list and other related information. In conclusion, while the two questions you asked are related, they seek different information pertinent to the TGC and SSC(T) selection processes. It is recommended that you attend the SSB interview for SSC(T)-47 to increase your chances of commissioning as a technical officer and gain valuable experience with the selection process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Dr. Glenn Tisman, a cancer specialist, knew his young neighbor, Ray Bateman, had an unusual mind. But he had no idea at the time that 12 - year - old Ray had the ability to become his partner in cancer research. Ray's parents remembered that at age four, Ray surprised them by fixing a broken vacuum cleaner . When he was ten, he speedily constructed the family color television from a kit. Later, he succeeded in assembling a complex stereo system after two experts had failed to do the job. When Ray was ten, he convinced his parents to buy him a computer. In a short time, Ray was able to do amazing things with the computer. Ray shared his enthusiasm for computers with Dr. Tisman, who used a computer for his research. The two discussed computers and medicine frequently. Amazingly, Ray understood the biology and chemistry related to Dr. Tisman's medical research without any previous instruction. Ray then worked with Dr. Tisman after school. He helped conduct research with the equipment and kept it in working order. The purpose of the research was to test the effectiveness of mixing an old cancer drug with certain vitamins. Ray analyzed patient test results by computer, while Dr. Tisman handled all patient contact. Together, they came up with solid research that helped advance cancer treatment. In 1988, 14 - year - old Ray went with Dr. Tisman to a meeting of the American Federation for Clinical Research(AFCR), where Ray presented their initial research findings. Using terminology beyond the grasp of most kids his age, Ray told the scientists how the new drug mixture caused fewer and milder side effects for cancer patients. A year later, Ray returned to the meeting to update the findings of his and Dr. Tisman's research. By then, he had become well - known for his devotion to finding cures for sick patients. Stories about him appeared in hundred of newspapers around the world. He appeared on television newscasts and talk shows. Ray continued to spend most free hours working with Dr. Tisman. The two began studying the effects of vitamins on babies inside the womb . However, Ray's main interest remained cancer treatment, and he continues his research today.

Also, putting the lid on the pot helps hold the heat inside, making the water boil faster. The other option (II) is not a good choice, because starting with cold water will take a longer time for the water to heat up and boil on the stove.

Question: Information: - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul). - Pittsburgh is a city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny County. The Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population of 2,659,937 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 20th-largest in the U.S. Located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which form the Ohio River, Pittsburgh is known as both \\"the Steel City\\" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses, and as the \\"City of Bridges\\" for its 446 bridges. The city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclines, a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers. The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest. The mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires, Virginia, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders. - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries it had the privilege of a sanctuary, except against a writ of the Lord Chief Justice or of the Lords of the Privy Council; and as a result it was the refuge of the perpetrators of every grade of crime, debauchery, and offence against the laws. The execution of a warrant there, if at any time practicable, was attended with great danger, as all united in a maintenance in common of the immunity of the place. It was one of the last places of sanctuary used in England, abolished by Act of Parliament named \\"The Escape from Prison Act\\" in 1697 and a further Act in 1723.

The Marathi people have their own thriving film industry, and these productions can serve as useful educational tools in their own right. To make sure you’re able to absorb what you’re seeing, start with programs aimed at young viewers and work your way up from there. Play close attention to the dialogue and see how many words and phrases you can pick out from memory. If possible, turn on the subtitles in your native language. Seeing the dialogue written out will help you create associations between what you hear and the meaning displayed on screen. Movies often depict normal people in normal situations, which means you’ll be getting a valuable glimpse of how the language is used in everyday life. Throw on a pair of headphones and jam out to some Bela Shende or Raja Hasan during your workout or on your walk home from school. Because of its uncomplicated lyrical structure and repetitive nature, popular music can help reinforce language skills without ever feeling like work. Another plus to using music as a study aid is that you can pause and rewind a song whenever you come to a section you don’t understand. Maharashtra has produced many famous playback singers for Indian movies, so much of the music that comes out of the region contains vocals sung in Marathi. You can find recordings from many famous Marathi artists on websites like YouTube. Pick up a newspaper or magazine printed in Marathi and try to decipher as much as you can. This is great practice for going over the many symbols of the Marathi alphabet. As your comprehension improves, you can move onto more difficult material like novels and technical essays. Focus on headlines, blurbs, and other short passages on your first few attempts to keep from being overwhelmed. Children’s books and nursery rhymes are perfect for brushing up on basic Marathi grammar. Ask someone who’s fluent in the language if they would be willing to help you practice by carrying on a short conversation. They’ll be able to adapt to your individual skill level, help you with your pronunciation, and gently correct your mistakes. When learning to speak an unfamiliar language, there’s no substitute for firsthand experience. Many Indian people speak more than one dialect. It’s possible that your friend might have a good grasp of conversational Marathi, even if they’re not from Maharashtra. If you don’t personally know anyone who speaks Marathi, try making a new friend online who you can chat with via Skype or FaceTime.","completion":"The article suggests learning Marathi language by starting with programs for kids, using subtitles, watching movies, listening to music, reading newspapers, practicing with fluent speakers, and making new friends online."},{"prompt":"Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What can feed at more than one trophic level?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Identify the reaction between H2SO4 and KOH, which is an acid-base neutralization reaction: H2SO4 (aq) + 2KOH (aq) → K2SO4 (aq) + 2H2O (l) 2. Find the limiting reagent: Moles of H2SO4 = volume (in L) × normality = 0.05 L × 0.2 N = 0.01 eq Moles of KOH = volume (in L) × normality = 0.05 L × 1 N = 0.05 eq H2SO4 is the limiting reagent since it has fewer moles. 3. Determine the heat liberated using the heat of neutralization: The heat of neutralization between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -57.32 kJ/mol.

Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What two movements did the man who taught a variety of positions help influence toward the end of his life? Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Both your puppy and your cat need a room in which they can adjust. You do not want to force a meeting right away. Give your pets separate care and attention for the first day or two. You should usually confine the new pet initially, meaning you should keep your puppy in a separate room before letting her roam around the house. Make sure the room is stocked with adequate food, water, and toys. Make sure to spend plenty of time with your new puppy as she adjusts to your home. You should switch out which animal is confined. This will give them each a chance to explore the home. They can also get used to one another's smells, and become increasingly comfortable with the fact a new animal is present. Rotate the animals every few hours. It's important the puppy has a chance to leave the room and explore a little, but you should not allow her free-range of the house yet, as this may interfere with potty training. Expand the area in which the puppy is confined to two or three rooms and watch her closely to watch for signs of toileting. When the animals are not confined, they may interact through the door. Your dog may, for example, sniff or paw at the door. For the most part, this is safe; however, if your puppy is excessively pawing at the door, correct the behavior. This can cause stress for your cat, leading to a messy introduction. It's very important the dog and the cat get accustomed to one another's scent. You can swap small bits of bedding, like pillows or blankets. You can also exchange toys. Try rubbing a towel on one animal and putting the towel under the other animal's food dish. You should never leave your pets unsupervised before you've made many successful face-to-face introductions. Make sure both the dog and cat are securely confined to separate areas when no one is home. You may wish tocrate train your puppy and keep her safely confined while you are out, allowing the cat free range (as he is presumably already comfortable in the house) If you secure the cat in a room while you're gone, make sure he has access to a litter box.","completion":"Introducing a new puppy to a cat involves confining each separately, swapping their spaces to acclimatize them to each other's smells, trading bedding and toys, and gradual, supervised introductions, with both securely separated when left alone, to ensure a stress-free and successful familiarization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

American Airlines is facing a possible perfect storm of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, terrible labor relations with its pilots, delayed and canceled flights, aircraft seats that won't stay put and a growing number of reported flights diverted because of various problems midflight. Travel agents and customers who book their own travel are starting to question whether they should fly the airline. Who wants to fly American?

The airline blames the increasing list of canceled and delayed flights on its pilots union, after the company persuaded a bankruptcy judge last month to throw out the pilots' contract. The company says the pilots are calling in unnecessary repairs to slow down flights. \\"The NFL was just fine with replacement referees, so sure let's use replacement pilots and mechanics for American Airlines,\\" wrote OhRReally. \\"Maybe those brilliant corporate leaders at American Airlines should embrace the NFL model for skilled-employee labor disputes: call in the replacements!

Question: How high is the crossbar of a FIFA rules football goal in feet? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Research the measurement of a FIFA rules football goal crossbar in the standard unit of measurement (meters). According to the Laws of the Game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) and the guidelines provided by Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the distance from the lower edge of the crossbar to the ground must be 2.44 meters. Step 2: Convert the measurement from meters to feet. To convert the measurement from meters to feet, we can use the conversion factor 1 meter = 3.281 feet. 2.44 meters * 3.281 feet/meter ≈ 8.00504 feet Step 3: Round off the result to a reasonable number of decimal places. Rounding off to two decimal places, the height of the crossbar in feet is 8.01 feet.

Some important people who help make decisions for our towns have agreed on a new idea. Let me tell you about it! So, there are these two areas called Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and Norfolk and Suffolk. The people who help make decisions for these places are called council leaders. They have thought of a plan to have two new elected mayors – one for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and another for Norfolk and Suffolk. Now, you might be wondering, \\"What is an elected mayor?\\" Well, an elected mayor is a person who gets chosen by the people, like your mommy and daddy, to help make important decisions and make sure everything in their town is working well. Just like when you chose your class leader, people in these towns will also pick their favorite person for the job, and that person will become their mayor. These two new mayors will be in charge of their own areas. One will look after Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and the other will take care of Norfolk and Suffolk. This will help make the towns better, because they will have their own leaders to focus just on their needs and make them even better places to live for you and your families. Now you might be thinking, \\"Why do they want two mayors?\\" That's a great question! These council leaders believe having two mayors would help the towns work smoothly, because each mayor will know so much about their own area and how to make it even better. So, everyone is really excited about this plan! We can't wait to see who the new mayors will be, how they'll help make our towns better, and all the great things that will happen because of their work. Remember, kids, it's always fun to learn about how decisions are made where you live, and who helps make those decisions, just like these two new elected mayors will do!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - The nuclei of some atoms have too few or too many neutrons - The atoms become unstable - The atoms split - In alpha decay, two protons and two neutrons are released from the atom - In beta decay, a neutron changes into a proton and an electron - The proton joins the nucleus of the atom - The electron is released - Question: suppose more atoms split happens, how will it affect less neutrons are releases from the atom. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A: More When more atoms undergo nuclear decay, the effect will typically result in a higher number of neutrons being released from the atoms. This occurs because the process of nuclear decay is directly linked to the behavior of neutrons in an unstable atomic nucleus. To understand this relationship, it's helpful to delve deeper into the types of decay, their processes, and the role of neutrons in these transformations. First and foremost, atomic nuclei contain protons and neutrons. The number of neutrons in a nucleus can impact the stability of an atom. Some atoms may have an excess of neutrons or too few of them, causing the atom to become unstable. There are primarily two types of decay processes that these unstable atoms can undergo: alpha decay and beta decay. 1. Alpha decay: In this decay process, the unstable atom's nucleus releases an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. The decay results in a new atom with a lower atomic number and fewer neutrons in the nucleus. This process is common in heavier, more massive atoms that need to lose mass to become stable. 2. Beta decay: This decay occurs when a neutron in the unstable nucleus transforms into a proton and electron. The proton stays in the nucleus, while the electron is ejected as a beta particle. This process is common in atoms that have too many neutrons compared to protons and need to achieve a more balanced configuration. Beta decay comes in two types: beta-minus decay, where a neutron turns into a proton and an electron, and beta-plus decay (or positron emission), where a proton turns into a neutron and a positron. Considering these decay processes, if more atoms were to split, it would result in an increased number of neutrons being released. This is because the release of neutrons is directly tied to the decay process of unstable atoms, which in turn impacts the stability and configuration of nuclei in these atoms. As more unstable atoms undergo these changes, the overall number of neutrons released into the environment will also increase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The film revolves around the various off-camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced Daytime Soap Opera. The first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic A-List cast. 'Soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era. The film is superbly led by Sally Field, as the neurotic ageing actress Celeste Talbert (She famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like \\"Gloria F*CKING Swanson!\\"). Her supporting cast reads like a who's-who of 90's Movie Greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy all elevate the film greatly. Goldberg is predictably excellent, whilst Downey Jr.'s and Hatcher's performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve. In terms of writing, the film is outstanding. There is a really modern edge to the script, which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions. There also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time. In some ways, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'High Anxiety' (1977). Much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing, but pretty accurate, representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, The extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by Carrie Fisher, is both hilarious and honest. 'Soapdish' is, for my money, one of the very best comedies Hollywood produced during the 1990's. It's excellent script and A-Class cast make it a must-see. It's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes.","completion":"Based on the text, the correct sentiment is (ii) positive.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Horror movies and thrillers need to be your homework, because editing is finally the place where you get to create the real suspense. You could spend years studying editing, but a quick master-class of your favorite movies will do. For each scene, pull out a notepad and write down: The length of cuts. Do they use long, slow shots, short and quick cuts, or a combination of both? When do they use each? How long is the scene, and at what point does each key event happen. You'll be surprised how similar this is in many movies. What are the music and sound cues? When do they come in, rise, and fall away? What is the lighting like? How does color, tone, and brightness affect the mood of the scene? Pay attention to the length of the cuts, and how the juxtapose against each other. While this rule isn't hard and fast, longer cuts tend to build dread and suspense, with shorter cuts breeding action, excitement, and confusion. This is a good way to play with tension and release -- a key to good suspense. Watch how some movies \\"fake\\" the release, making you expect a scare, but actually providing nothing terrible (like a cat jumping out). This puts your audience on edge without blowing the big scare. Remember -- suspense comes from worrying about what is going to happen next, or seeing what is happening and being unable to stop it. Note how your favorite movies build this horror. Check the climactic basement scene near the end of The Silence of the Lambs for a master course in long takes punctuated by quick bursts of action. Sound is actually one of the best, if not the best, way to create tension and suspense. Why? Because it hints at things the viewer can't see, increasing worry, confusion, and dread. From floorboard creaks to the whistling of the wind, chirping crickets to sudden, heart-stopping silence, you can mine a lot more tension out of subtle sounds than most movie viewers ever realize. You can find thousands of free sound effects online with a quick search. For serious movies, consider paying for access to a professional sound bank. Silence is key to suspense, especially when broken by a nerve-clenching noise like a sharpening blade, slowly opening door, or sudden breath or whisper. You can find hundreds of copyright-free suspense songs on the internet, generally using violins, piano, and ambient noises to build quiet dread. When using music, try to be sparing -- you want your scares to come from visual and sound design, using the music as a final touch to pull it together. Keep it in the background, barely perceptible, to subtly impact your audience without pulling their attention from the scene. No Country for Old Men famously used no music at all, which created its own unique, silent suspense. Summary:","completion":"Editing is crucial in creating suspense in horror movies and thrillers. By studying your favorite films, you can identify key elements such as the length of cuts, music and sound cues, and lighting that all contribute to the tension in a scene. Longer cuts often build dread, while shorter cuts create action and excitement. Some movies may \\"fake\\" a scare to keep the audience on edge, and suspense is generated through anticipation or the feeling of helplessness. Sound is an essential tool to create tension, with subtle noises hinting at unseen danger. Professional sound banks can provide high-quality effects, but free alternatives are available online. Silence can also be a powerful contributor to suspense, with sudden noises breaking the silence to create gripping moments. Using music sparingly lets visual and sound design take precedence in building dread; a good example of this is the film \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" which utilized no music at all, creating a unique silent suspense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Every year, they celebrate the town's founding by participating in a friendly tournament, the Fairwood Baseball Bonanza, featuring players of all ages. With a rich history of successful baseball players coming out of the town, baseball has become more than just a game, but a way of life. The story revolves around Joe Sullivan, a 12-year-old kid with a passion for baseball. Joe grew up listening to his grandfather's tales of the old days and has always dreamt of participating in the Fairwood Baseball Bonanza. Unfortunately, his father, Tom Sullivan, an ex-professional baseball player, doesn't share his enthusiasm due to a career-ending injury that has built animosity within the family. In the days leading up to the tournament, a mysterious ball pops up behind home plate while Joe practices with his team. This sends the town gossiping and speculating about the origin of the ball. It is rumored to be a legendary ball, said to have been used by the town's founding father, Walter Fairwood, during baseball's infancy. However, nobody has seen the ball in decades, and it was widely believed to have vanished into thin air. Joe and his friends embark on an adventure to uncover the ball's origins, exploring Fairwood's history and meeting various characters from the town's past. Along the way, they learn about the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and the love of the game. Joe discovers the hidden stories of his father's baseball career and his grandfather's cherished memories, realizing that there's more to the game than just winning. During their quest, Tom uncovers his love for baseball again and starts sharing left-out stories with Joe, reconstructing their relationship. Eventually, the ball's true origins are revealed to be connected with the Sullivan family legacy. As the tournament begins, the entire town comes together to cheer on their friends and family. Guided by the newfound bond between Joe and his father, the team enters the championship game with a renewed sense of camaraderie and determination. In the final moments of the game, Joe, inspired by the legendary ball, hits a game-winning home run, solidifying his place in the town's history. The Hidden Ball is an exploration of family, history, and the power of baseball in uniting a community. The journey takes the audience through a tale of love, forgiveness, and self-discovery as the characters are brought together by the legendary ball that once seemed like just a myth.

Heyman (died June 25, 2013), a prominent personal injury attorney, and Sulamita Heyman (died February 27, 2009). His family was Jewish, and his mother was a Holocaust survivor. By age 11, he was running a mail order business selling celebrity and sports memorabilia from his home. While still a teenager, he fast-talked his way backstage at a World Wide Wrestling Federation event at Madison Square Garden as a photojournalist. Context: After departing WCW, Heyman attempted to start a new promotion in Texas with Jim Crockett, Jr.. Disagreement arose, however, as Crockett wanted to build a traditional wrestling brand, while Heyman believed traditional wrestling was antiquated and a new take on the genre was needed. At this time, Eddie Gilbert was a booker for a Philadelphia-based promotion, National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Eastern Championship Wrestling, which he did under the ownership of a local pawn shop owner named Tod Gordon. Heyman came in to help Gilbert teach the younger wrestlers how to perform on interviews, but Gilbert's erratic behavior became too much for Gordon, who had a major falling out with Gilbert right before the \\"Ultra Clash\\" event on September 18, 1993. From that point forward, Heyman was in charge of the creative direction of the company. As Paul E. Dangerously, he managed a few wrestlers, including Sabu and 911. A year later, the company was the flagship promotion of the struggling NWA. A tournament was scheduled to be held in August 1994 for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, at an ECW-hosted event mostly featuring ECW wrestlers. The proposed outcome was the current ECW champion Shane Douglas becoming champion, but Heyman conspired with Douglas and Gordon without the knowledge of NWA president Dennis Coralluzzo to have Douglas (and by extension, ECW itself) publicly denounce the NWA and its \\"tradition\\" after winning the tournament. In his post-match speech, Douglas aggressively assaulted the title's lineage, throwing the belt itself down, proclaiming the NWA a \\"dead organization\\" and declaring his ECW title a world-level championship. The plan for this shoot screwjob was known only to those three. That same week, Heyman and Tod Gordon rechristened the promotion, eliminating the regional branding \\"Eastern\\" and declaring the promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling. They broke the company away from the NWA, and ECW became its own entity. Heyman encouraged wrestlers to express their true feelings about the WWF, the NWA, and WCW. Heyman bought out Gordon and became sole owner of ECW. During his time in ECW, Heyman found an ally in Vince McMahon's WWF. McMahon had sent some WWF wrestlers to ECW (under WWF payroll) to develop them and was interested in some ECW wrestlers, such as Terry Gordy and 2 Cold Scorpio. McMahon paid Heyman 1,000 per week to rent Scorpio. In the final days of ECW, Heyman did not appear on the show and was replaced as the leader of the backstage and creative by ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer. ECW entered into bankruptcy in 2001 (just weeks after WCW was sold to WWF for 2,000,000, after AOL Time Warner wrote off over 100 million in debt), with the company 7,000,000 in arrears, with over 3,000,000 owed to the company by InDemand pay per view. Question: What happened at the Ultra Clash event? Answer:","completion":"At the Ultra Clash event on September 18, 1993, Eddie Gilbert's erratic behavior had reached a boiling point, leading to a major falling out with Tod Gordon, the owner of the Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW). This incident led to Paul Heyman taking charge of the creative direction of the company, which was a significant turning point in the history of ECW. The event itself, Ultra Clash, was an important showcase for the promotion, featuring several notable matches and feuds. Some key moments from the Ultra Clash event include: 1. A \\"Loser Gets a Haircut\\" match between JT Smith and Tony Stetson, where Smith emerged victorious, leading to Stetson getting his head shaved. 2. A \\"Singapore Cane Match\\" between Tommy Cairo and The Sandman, which Cairo won, earning the right to strike The Sandman multiple times with a Singapore cane. This was an early glimpse into the hardcore and extreme style of wrestling that ECW would become famous for in later years. 3. A \\"Battle Royal\\" featuring several ECW wrestlers, won by Glenn Osbourne, showcasing the talent within the promotion and further establishing its roster. 4. The main event of the evening, featuring The Dark Patriot (Doug Gilbert) defeating JT Smith in a singles match. While the specific details of Gilbert's falling out with Gordon at Ultra Clash are not well-documented, the event marks a crucial turning point in the history of ECW, with Heyman taking the reins of the company, paving the way for the innovation and extreme style of wrestling that the company is known for today. Under Heyman's leadership, the promotion eventually broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and rebranded itself as Extreme Championship Wrestling, evolving into a groundbreaking and influential force within the professional wrestling industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered. Tanks do not have a steering wheel. Instead, they have an accelerator to produce forward motion and separate brakes on each tread. The operator uses brakes on both treads at the same time in order to stop, but brakes on only one tread to turn the tank. By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread. Benjamin is taking an Army training class and is learning to operate a tank. Today, he is in a tank with an instructor on a training course. Benjamin drives the tank forward and comes to a large dirt mound blocking his path. He needs to decide whether to break the left tread or right tread. If the tread on the right is going faster which direction will the tank turn? Answer:","completion":"To determine the direction the tank will turn, let's think through the process step-by-step: 1. Benjamin is operating a tank that steers by controlling the speed of the left and right treads. 2.

King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders.

Lilya is a normal teenage girl albeit poor and pretty impoverished. Lilya's mother (Lyubov Agapova) informs Lilya that they are emigrating to the US with her new boyfriend. At the last minute, Lilya is left behind in the care of her aunt Anna (Liliya Shinkaryova). She is forced to move into a dirty flat (whilst her aunt moved into the bigger and nicer flat that Lilya and her mother used to live in) is just the beginning and a succession of miseries are thrust upon Lilya. Lilya's best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for some extra cash but Lilya decides not to. However, when the friend's father finds money made from prostitution, the friend claims that she was the one sat at the bar whilst Lilya was out sleeping with men for the money. Not only is Lilya's reputation at home ruined but the story begins to spread throughout the school. Now abandoned, Lilya has to turn to prostitution to help her get money together. One glimmer of hope comes in the form of Volodya (Artyom Bogucharskiy), who she forms a close friendship with. He is also abused and rejected by his alcoholic father.

Explanation: Earth's tilt on its axis causes different parts of the world to receive different amounts of sunlight during the year, creating seasons. In December, in the northern hemisphere, the Earth's tilt causes it to receive less sunlight, making it colder and creating winter. That's why we need to wear heavy clothing during the winter months. Wrong answers: (ii). Mercury's axis has nothing to do with Earth's seasons. Seasons happen on Earth because of Earth's tilt, not other planets' tilt. (iii). Pluto's gravitational pull is very weak and does not significantly affect Earth's tilt or seasons. (iv).

She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian. Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification. Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\". In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite; she was called \\"New York's leading It Girl\\", whose fame was beginning to \\"extend beyond the New York tabloids\\". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's \\"Honey Bunny\\" video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, \\"Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast\\". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: \\"Hilton plays--what else?--a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day\\".

Regardless of which way you choose to log your transactions, you have to be able to refer back to them easily and reliably.","completion":"Step 1: Choose a method for tracking expenses To create a consistent system, first determine whether you want to track your finances digitally or on paper. Some people prefer spreadsheets or personal finance apps, while others find logging expenses in a physical notebook more comfortable. Consider your lifestyle and preferences before deciding on a method. Step 2: Categorize your expenses Break down your expenses into categories such as rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, entertainment, and savings. This will help you identify patterns in your spending and determine which areas you might need to adjust to meet your financial goals. Step 3: Set a budget Based on your income and expenses, establish a monthly budget for each category. If you're unsure of where to start, look back at your previous expenses to get a sense of your average spending habits. Step 4: Record every transaction To maintain consistency, make a habit of logging each transaction when it happens or as soon as possible after. Include the date, description of the transaction, category, and amount spent. This will help you stay on top of your finances and prevent any discrepancies. Step 5: Review your expenses regularly Set aside time each week or month to review your expenses. Compare your spending to your budget to see if you're staying within your limits or if there are areas where you can improve. This will help you adjust your spending habits and make more informed decisions in the future. Step 6: Adjust your budget as needed Over time, your financial priorities and circumstances may change, so it's important to keep your budget up to date. If you notice that you consistently overspend in one category or that your income has increased, adjust your budget accordingly. Step 7: Save and invest Once you have a stable budget in place, set aside a portion of your income for savings and investments. This will help you reach your long-term financial goals, such as buying a house, funding your retirement, or creating an emergency fund. By following these steps and maintaining a consistent system for tracking your personal finances, you'll be well-prepared to make informed decisions about your financial future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to a federal law enforcement official who spoke with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Frein had been anticipating his inevitable arrest. The source revealed that the fugitive had spent a significant amount of time in a hangar at the small airport where he was ultimately caught. Contrary to some rumors, the US Marshals were not acting on a tip when they discovered Frein outside the hangar. The Scranton Times-Tribune reports that they had been employing a grid strategy of searching throughout the manhunt and simply followed through on their procedure in that particular area. Frein was found unarmed at the time of his capture. When queried about the noticeable gash on Frein's nose and bruises on his face, a police official stated that the injuries had not occurred during or after his arrest. Interestingly, the handcuffs used to restrain Frein belonged to the state trooper who lost his life in the shooting incident. The capture of Eric Frein had been a top priority for law enforcement in Pennsylvania and nationwide. He was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, and the manhunt for him ultimately involved more than 1,000 officers from multiple agencies across the state. Despite the substantial resources invested in tracking him down, Frein had managed to evade authorities for an extended period by taking refuge in the dense woodland of the Pocono Mountains.

Answer the following question: Information: - An electric light is a device that produces visible light by the flow of electric current. It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities. In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap. - Night skiing is the sport of skiing or snowboarding after sundown, offered at many ski resorts and mountains. There are usually electric lights including LED lamps along the piste which allow for better visibility. It typically begins after a resort's skiing-day ends (sunset), and ends between 8:00 and 10:30 p.m. - Sunset or sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon as a result of Earth's rotation. The Sun will set exactly due west at the equator on the the spring and fall equinoxes, each of which occurs only once a year. The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the trailing edge of the Sun's disk disappears below the horizon. Near to the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes the ray path of light from the Sun to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the Sun's disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when sunset is observed. - Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS). - A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity. - Montana is a state in the Western region of the United States. The state's name is derived from the Spanish word (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including \\"Big Sky Country\\" and \\"The Treasure State\\", and slogans that include \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" and more recently \\"The Last Best Place\\".

Movie title: Breach Movie plot: Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) is a young FBI employee assigned to work undercover as a clerk to Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper), a senior agent he is told is suspected of being a sexual deviant. Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the State Department to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in Information Assurance. Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly \\"shoot guns\\" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's information technology systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies. Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout Catholic who is also a member of Opus Dei, Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular East German-born wife to become active churchgoers. O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the undercover assignment, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration. Hanssen is suspected of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States. He learns that FBI Director Louis Freeh is personally leading the investigation. While the FBI could arrest Hanssen under lesser charges, they want to catch him in an act of espionage, so they can threaten him with the death penalty for treason and possibly induce him to divulge the information he has compromised. O'Neill is ordered to obtain data from Hanssen's Palm Pilot and keep him occupied while FBI agents search his... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Breach,\\" it is Eric O'Neill, portrayed by Ryan Phillippe, who provides assurance to Robert Hanssen, played by Chris Cooper, that he's not being trailed by Russians or the FBI. O'Neill is a young FBI employee who is assigned to work undercover as a clerk to Hanssen, initially under the pretense of investigating him for being a sexual deviant. However, as O'Neill becomes closer to Hanssen, he learns of the true purpose of his assignment: the FBI suspects Hanssen has been spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for years, and has caused the deaths of American agents. As O'Neill gets to know Hanssen, he initially finds no concrete evidence of Hanssen's double life. In the process, O'Neill starts to develop respect for his boss, and they form a bond. O'Neill plays a crucial role in allaying Hanssen's suspicions about being trailed by the Russians or the FBI. This trust between Hanssen and O'Neill is essential for the FBI to collect more evidence against Hanssen and ultimately catch him in the act of espionage. Toward the end of the movie, O'Neill is ordered to obtain data from Hanssen's Palm Pilot, while keeping him occupied as other FBI agents search Hanssen's car. It is during this critical period that O'Neill's role in assuring Hanssen that he is not being trailed by anyone becomes paramount in order to maintain Hanssen's trust and ultimately bring him down."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers.

Hypothesis: Jose was a new soldier in the army at the time","completion":"Drawing the hypothesis that Private First Class Jose F. Valdez was a new soldier in the army at the time depends on the contextual background provided and the analysis of key information within that context. Based on the provided context, we can gather some supporting and opposing information for this hypothesis: Supporting points: 1. The rank of Private First Class in the United States Army is typically associated with soldiers who have been recently promoted after completing basic training. This could be an indication that Jose was relatively new to the army at the time. 2. By considering his birth date (January 3, 1925) and his date of death (February 17, 1945), we can deduce that he was 20 years old when he died. Depending on when he enlisted, this could support the idea that he was new to the army at the time. Opposing points: 1. His date of enlistment is not provided in the context. It is possible that he could have enlisted earlier in the war and had more experience than this hypothesis suggests. 2. The fact that he received the Medal of Honor posthumously demonstrates that he performed heroic actions during the Battle of the Colmar Pocket. This level of skill and bravery might be an indication of a more experienced soldier rather than a new one. 3. World War II lasted from 1939 to 1945. Given that the Battle of the Colmar Pocket occurred during this time, it is possible that Jose could have been in the army for some time before his death. Without information about his length of service, it is difficult to ascertain whether he was a new soldier or not. Based on the context provided, we can see that there exist both supporting and opposing points that could justify the hypothesis that Private First Class Jose F. Valdez was a new soldier in the army at the time. However, without more information, specifically his enlistment date and length of service, it is difficult to conclusively confirm or refute this hypothesis. To get a more conclusive answer, we would need additional information about Jose's military career, including how long he had served in the United States Army and any other relevant data that could help determine his level of experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Low-income domestic violence victims may find long-term legal help -- representation in divorces or child-custody disputes -- hard to come by, if two organizations now providing such help can't replace their lost funding. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than 450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The 175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake. Although an order's requirements that an abuser stay away from a victim may remain in effect for years, protective orders only settle issues such as child custody, child support, custody and property arrangements for 150 days. Many judges are reluctant to address those issues in emergency protective orders, since the decrees stay in effect for such a short time, Milne and Ralphs said. \\"The likelihood a victim will return to her abuser increases if she cannot permanently sever the relationship and establish workable support, custody and property arrangements,\\" the funding request to CVR said. The Department of Justice said it denied the grant application, in part, because evaluators did not see enough collaboration between the organizations and victims' advocates, Ralphs and Milne told CVR board members. While the two said they believe their organizations coordinate well, the organizations cannot appeal the grant denial. Although CVR board members considered giving the money as a loan, not a grant, their vote on the funding request -- taken after Milne and Ralphs left the meeting -- was unanimous.

Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"Calvin's view of democracy is rooted in his belief in a combination of aristocracy and democracy as the ideal political system.

To safeguard the rights and liberties of ordinary people, he advocated for a separation of powers through a system of checks and balances, which played a crucial role in resisting political absolutism and contributed to the development of modern democracy. Calvinism's impact on democracy was evident in the 17th and 18th centuries, notably in the Netherlands, which emerged as one of the freest nations in Europe under Calvinist leadership.

Process: - An animal eats a lot of food to fatten up - The animal finds or builds a suitable place to hibernate where they can stay warm and protected - The animal moves into their den - Their heart rate and breathing slow down to conserve energy - They emerge from the den when the weather is warming up again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather gets cold enough happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If the weather gets cold enough to cause a significant drop in temperature beyond the normal range for hibernation, it may adversely affect the animal's ability to hibernate properly. The potential impact of this perturbation can be explained through various factors: 1. Insufficient energy reserves: If the cold weather arrives earlier than expected or lasts longer than usual, the animal might not have enough time to consume and store sufficient food and energy reserves required for the entire hibernation period. Insufficient energy reserves can lead to malnourishment or even death during hibernation. 2. Difficulty finding or building a suitable den: Drastic or unexpected drops in temperature can make it challenging for animals to locate or build an appropriate den in a timely manner. In extreme cases, animals might enter hibernation without access to a proper den, leading to increased vulnerability to predators, temperature, and moisture fluctuations. 3. Disrupted hibernation cycles: Extreme cold or sudden changes in temperature could disturb the animal's normal hibernation cycle. Frequent disruptions in hibernation cycles can result in increased energy usage and overall stress on the animal. 4. Potential health issues: While hibernating, the animal relies on its physiological adaptations to survive for extended periods without food, water, or elimination of waste. Inadequate hibernation conditions can lead to health problems resulting from limited energy reserves, impaired immune responses, or other biological responses to the cold and lack of resources. 5. Challenges upon emerging: If the extreme cold affects the distribution or availability of food sources upon the animal's emergence from hibernation, it might face challenges in replenishing energy reserves and recovering from the hibernation period. In conclusion, the perturbation caused by extremely cold weather can have both direct and indirect effects on an animal's ability to hibernate properly. These effects can manifest through disruptions in hibernation cycles, inadequate living conditions, insufficient energy reserves, health issues, and challenges faced upon the animal's emergence from hibernation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Sinead O'Connor's Advice to Miley Cyrus: Social Media Weighs In Introduction In a recent open letter to Miley Cyrus, Irish singer Sinead O'Connor shared her concerns about the direction the young pop star has taken in her career, urging her to stop allowing herself to be \\"pimped\\" and exploited by the music industry. O'Connor's comments, which come on the heels of Cyrus' controversial and provocative performances and music videos, have ignited a heated discussion on social media. Are O'Connor's concerns for Miley Cyrus valid, and do they have any bearing on our lives? We took to Twitter to find out. Background Sinead O'Connor's letter advised Miley Cyrus to be wary of those around her who might be taking advantage of her youth and vulnerability for financial gain. Referring to Cyrus' recent raunchy performances and revealing outfits, O'Connor wrote: \\"When you partake in allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping, nothing but harm will come out of it in the long run.\\" Social Media Reaction As soon as the letter went public, social media users began to weigh in on O'Connor's concerns and advice to Cyrus, with reactions ranging from agreement to apathy, and criticism to confusion. Some Twitter users expressed their support for O'Connor's message, appreciating the fact that she had taken the time to voice her concerns about the young star's wellbeing. \\"Sinead O'Connor's letter to Miley Cyrus is a perfect example of how women should look out for each other. It's heartfelt, powerful, and necessary,\\" @johndoewriter wrote. Others, however, felt that O'Connor's involvement was unwarranted and unwelcome, suggesting that the young pop star is simply following her own path in the industry. \\"@MileyCyrus is definitely not the first artist to shock and push boundaries. Sinead O'Connor's letter is a waste of time,\\" @musiclover123 commented. Surprisingly, some Twitter users admitted they had not previously been fans of O'Connor, but her letter to Cyrus had piqued their interest. \\"@SineadOconnorHQ was never on my radar until I read her letter to Miley Cyrus. Listening now and can't believe I was missing out on her music,\\" @newfan2021 tweeted. The Impact on our Lives What's evident is that O'Connor's comments have struck a chord with people on social media, as evidenced by the wide range of reactions. However, the larger issue her letter raises is the debate over the potential exploitation of young artists in the entertainment industry, and whether we as a society should be more mindful of our own role in the \\"pimping\\" process. Beyond the direct advice to Cyrus, O'Connor's plea can be seen as an appeal to all of us to consider our responsibility for promoting and supporting an industry that can be harmful. By consuming media that exploits young artists or promotes harmful stereotypes, are we complicit in perpetuating this culture of exploitation? Conclusion While opinions on Sinead O'Connor's letter to Miley Cyrus may be divided, it's undeniable that her comments have started a conversation about the treatment of young artists in the music industry. As consumers, we have the power to drive change by choosing what content we support and engage with. It is a reminder that we have a role to play in shaping the messages and values within our popular culture. Now, we want to hear from you!

Günümüz Sırbistan'ında yoksulluk ve işsizlik, ülkenin başlıca sosyal sorunlarından bazılarını teşkil etmektedir. Bu sosyal zorluklar, hem hükûmetin ve yerel yönetimlerin hem de sivil toplum kuruluşlarının odak noktasında yer almaktadır. Sırbistan'da ekonomik durgunluk ve istikrarsızlık, uzun yıllardır süren iç çatışmalar ve uluslararası yaptırımların ardından, bu sorunların ortaya çıkmasına katkıda bulunan başlıca etkenler haline gelmiştir. Öncelikle, yoksulluk, Sırbistan nüfusunun önemli bir kısmını etkileyen bir sorundur. Yoksulluk sınırının altında yaşayan çok sayıda kişi bulunmakta ve bu durum, eğitim, sağlık ve yaşam kalitesi üzerinde olumsuz etkiler yaratmaktadır. Yetersiz sosyal güvence ve gelir dağılımındaki adaletsizlik, yoksulluğun daha da artmasına yol açmaktadır. İşsizlik ise Sırbistan ekonomisi için oldukça önemli bir problemdir. Ülke genelinde işsizlik oranı yüksek seviyelerde seyretmekte olup, genç nüfus üzerinde daha büyük bir etkisi olmaktadır. İş imkanlarının azlığı ve eğitim sistemiyle iş piyasasının ihtiyaçları arasındaki uyumsuzluk, işsizliğin önemli nedenlerinden bazılarıdır. İşsizlik, ekonomik olarak geri kalmış bölgelerde yaşayan insanların, daha fazla iş olanaklarını arayarak büyük şehirler ve yurtdışına göç etmesine yol açmaktadır. Hükûmet ve yerel yönetimler, bu sorunları çözmeye yönelik politikalar ve projeler üzerinde çalışmaktadır. Yoksullukla mücadele etmek için sosyal yardım programlarını ve işsizlik sigortasını genişletme, eğitim ve sağlık hizmetlerini yaygınlaştırma ve iyileştirme ve ekonomik fırsatlar yaratma stratejileri benimsemektedirler. Ayrıca, işsizlikle mücadelede, istihdam yaratma ve işgücü eğitimi gibi alanlarda yapısal reformlar gerçekleştirme ve iş piyasasına uyumlu eğitim fırsatları sağlama yoluyla bu soruna çözüm getirmek amaçlanmaktadır. Sivil toplum kuruluşları ve uluslararası örgütler de Sırbistan'ın bu sosyal sorunlarıyla başa çıkma çabalarına destek olmaktadır. Çeşitli projelerle toplumun daha az imkâna sahip kesimlerine yardım ederek, eğitim ve iş olanakları sunarak ve toplumun kültür ve değerlerine saygı göstererek, ülkenin yaşadığı bu zorlukları aşmasına katkıda bulunmaktadırlar. Sonuç olarak, Sırbistan'ın günümüzde karşı karşıya olduğu yoksulluk ve işsizlik sorunu, hem hükûmetin hem de sivil toplum kuruluşlarının ve uluslararası örgütlerin üzerinde durduğu önemli sosyal zorluklar arasında yer almaktadır. Ülkenin bu sorunları aşabilmesi ve daha gelişmiş bir ekonomi ve topluma kavuşabilmesi için, tüm tarafların sürekli olarak iş birliği ve çözüm odaklı yaklaşımlar sergilemesi büyük önem taşımaktadır."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Bardelys the Magnificent Context: Bardelys is a wealthy courtier in the court of Louis XIII, with a string of affairs with beautiful women, and a silver tongue. In the middle of a duel with a wronged husband, he manages to reconcile the couple and get them out of his rooms before they discover a more recent conquest hidden behind a door. Meanwhile, Chatellerault, another courtier, has been rejected by the beautiful Roxalanne, whose family opposes the king. Chatellerault returns to find the court laughing at him, and he bullies Bardelys into a bet that he cannot win and marry Roxalanne. His honor at stake, Bardelys travels to Roxalanne's castle, but is wounded en route and is mistaken for a rebel leader. He keeps up the ruse, as Bardelys' womanizing reputation would interfere with his plans. But, falling in love with Roxalanne, he cannot bring himself to marry her under a false name, and plans to return to announce that he's lost the bet. His refusal to pledge his love upsets Roxalanne, who turns him over to the king's guards. The only judge at his trial who knows his true name is Chatellerault, who sentences him to death under the rebel's name. Roxalanne agrees to marry Chatellerault in exchange for Bardelys' life, but Chatellerault still fails to intervene. On the gallows, Bardelys effects an impressive escape, and the king arrives and vouches for his identity. Confronting Chatellerault in a duel, he renders the newly married Roxalanne a widow, and receives the king's blessing on their impending marriage.

Even after Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance.

The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however.

You'll notice by the stars I've given this GREAT film that '...before you see it the first time,' is implied. I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much great coming in). I'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Still, it did. This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The entire film is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns. I would have given this film 10/10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. I don't hold that against this film too much, but I don't think it deserves a perfect score. Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. Nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed, as well. Jeremy Northam does really well, at first, as quite a geeky corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. However, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northam would/could/should fit that bill. He's suave and cultured. He's got a great Bond posture and voice. I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it, and rather down-to-Earth, as well.

Geppetto longed for nothing more than to have a child of his own. His wish was granted when a shooting star brought life to one of his most incredible creations - Pinocchio. Pinocchio was no ordinary marionette, for, unlike other puppets, he could move and speak without the support of strings. However, there was one catch; if Pinocchio wanted to become a real boy, he had to prove that he had a pure heart and be free from deceit and lies. The adventure begins when Pinocchio comes across an enchanted map, revealing the whereabouts of the legendary Stromboli's Puppet Show. This magical show was known to bestow unlimited potential and success upon the talented puppets who graced its stage. Intrigued by the prospect of fulfilling his dream to become a real boy, Pinocchio decides to embark on a journey to find the famous puppet show and join its crew of talented marionettes. During his journey, Pinocchio meets Felix the Fox and Whiskers the Cat, two cunning and mischievous animals. They convince Pinocchio that joining Stromboli's Puppet Show will not only grant him an opportunity to showcase his unique skills, but it also could hold the key to solving his problem. By becoming Stromboli's star performer, Pinocchio would earn fame, wealth, and, he is led to believe, the secret to becoming a real boy. Blinded by the promise of transforming into a real boy, Pinocchio follows Felix and Whiskers to the enchanted Puppet Master Stromboli's castle. Upon arriving, Pinocchio, Felix, and Whiskers are welcomed by the charismatic Stromboli, the master puppeteer who can animate puppets with a single touch of his magical wand. Stromboli recognizes Pinocchio's talent and potential and lavishes him with praise and admiration, promising that he would make him the star of his show. As the days pass, Pinocchio becomes increasingly blinded by the glitz and glamour of his newfound fame. He begins to neglect his father, Geppetto, and indulges in the deceptive and nefarious antics influenced by Felix and Whiskers. His nose grows progressively longer with each lie, symbolizing the strings that are pulling him further away from his true self and the possibility of becoming a real boy. Realizing that Pinocchio’s purity and innocence are slipping away, the Blue Fairy, the guardian of wishes, intervenes. The Blue Fairy reveals to Pinocchio that his newfound life is nothing but an illusion, and by pursuing fame and fortune, he has strayed far from the path that could lead to his transformation into a real boy. She further warns him that when the last petal falls from a magical rose that she leaves behind, his chance to become a real boy will be lost forever. Desperate to right his wrongs, Pinocchio, along with the help of his loyal friend and conscience, Jiminy Cricket, embarks on a heartwarming journey to break free from Stromboli’s control and put an end to his manipulative strings. Along the way, Pinocchio learns the importance of honesty, bravery, and love, proving that he has a pure heart beneath the wooden exterior. As the last rose petal falls, the Blue Fairy, moved by Pinocchio's unwavering courage and pure heart, grants him his ultimate wish - transforming him into a real boy. Reunited with his father Geppetto, Pinocchio finally understands that the true meaning of becoming a \\"real boy\\" lies in being honest, kind, and loving. Together, they celebrate as the magic of their love and devotion brings light to the once-dark village, proving that even the most flawed and imperfect beings can learn, change, and ultimately become real in the eyes of those who love them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: blix lashes out at u.s. officials for smear campaign Text:","completion":"Title: Blix Blasts U.S. Officials for Smear Campaign In a recent statement, Hans Blix, former head of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), vehemently criticized certain U.S. officials for what he perceives as a smear campaign against him and his colleagues. He argues that this campaign was orchestrated to undermine his team's efforts in assessing Iraq's compliance with the UN's disarmament requirements, ultimately paving the way for the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Blix, who served as the UN's chief weapons inspector from 2000 to 2003, was tasked with overseeing the inspection and eventual dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. During this period, he frequently voiced his concerns and doubts about the presence of WMDs in Iraq, despite the insistence of the U.S. and its allies that the threat posed by such weapons justified military intervention. In response to Blix's skepticism, some U.S. officials allegedly waged a smear campaign targeting him and his fellow inspectors, accusing them of incompetence and even collusion with the Iraqi government. In his statement, Blix contends that the campaign against him was designed to discredit the UNMOVIC and to silence any dissenting opinions concerning the necessity of the invasion. He points out that, in some cases, baseless accusations were circulated in the media, questioning his team's integrity and professionalism, and sowing doubt about their willingness to cooperate with the U.S. government. \\"These false claims,\\" Blix asserts, \\"were deliberately crafted to manipulate public opinion and to build a case for invasion based on lies and deceit.\\" The former UN chief weapons inspector further claims that those responsible for the smear campaign bore a personal vendetta against him, fueled by his outspoken opposition to the war. He accuses high-ranking U.S. officials of orchestrating a systematic attack on his credibility to secure support for an invasion that he believes did not have adequate basis in fact. \\"The smears against me and my colleagues were not simply misplaced criticism,\\" Blix states, \\"but part of a concerted effort to reinforce a predetermined narrative and to undermine the impartiality and independence of the UN inspections process.\\" Blix's statement has reignited the debate surrounding the legitimacy of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the motivations of those who supported it. As the evidence regarding the existence of WMDs in Iraq proved to be unfounded, many critics have decried the invasion as based on falsehoods and politically motivated manipulations. Blix's testimony adds fuel to the fire, suggesting that a deliberate campaign was waged against those who questioned the invasion's rationale, with the goal of silencing them and furthering the pro-intervention agenda. The impact of Blix's accusations remains to be seen, but their consequences could be far-reaching if it prompts further investigation into the conduct of officials involved in promoting the invasion. It seems clear that Blix's statement is not only an indictment of certain members of the U.S. government but also a call for greater scrutiny of the motivations behind the Iraq war. As the world continues to grapple with the consequences of this conflict, the revelation of a smear campaign against those who sought the truth about Iraq's WMD program further complicates an already contentious political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Subtract 61x from 64x. 0 = 3x + 15 Step 3: In order to isolate x, we need to move the constant term, 15, to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 15 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 15 = 3x + 15 - 15 Step 4: Simplify the left and right sides of the equation. -15 = 3x Step 5: Now we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. -15 / 3 = 3x / 3 Step 6: Simplify the left and right sides of the equation. -5 = x So the solution for the equation is x = -5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What place did Daniel Defoe visited in 1724? from the following article ? Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ... What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland. Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base... Answer:","completion":"Daniel Defoe visited the Chat Moss area in 1724, as mentioned in the article. He encountered this great bog or waste on his way from Warrington to Manchester. The area was difficult to traverse due to its inability to bear the weight of horses or humans unless it was an exceedingly dry season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Instructions: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Input: With this in mind, is it the perfect natural habitat for Conservatives? If you look at a map of the county, it certainly appears to be true blue, with the main exception of the western fringes which border Merseyside. When you look behind the numbers, though, Labour seems to have a good chance of painting more of Cheshire red. The constituency of Weaver Vale is currently held, with a majority of 991, by Graham Evans for the Conservatives. Whilst his party may feel at home in Tory-leaning areas like Frodsham and its rural hinterland, his biggest challenge comes from the part of his patch which includes Runcorn, where Labour have all but five of the 56 seats on the local council. Most of Runcorn and neighbouring Widnes are served by the traditionally safe Labour seat of Halton. That constituency, as well as Ellesmere Port and Neston and Warrington North include areas of considerable deprivation. Warrington South, where the Conservatives' David Mowat is defending a majority of 1,553, is also a key target for Labour. But in 2010 the Liberal Democrat vote meant the seat was a three-way marginal, and the continued popularity of the party in local council elections over the last four years adds another element of uncertainty. If Labour don't take the likes of Warrington South and Weaver Vale, their chances of being the biggest party in Westminster after the general election on 7 May look very shaky. The City of Chester, meanwhile, is the kind of seat Labour needs to secure in order to have any hope of gaining an outright majority. Tory Stephen Mosley has a majority of 5.5% but the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft's polls in the city are looking good for Labour. Lord Ashcroft predicted they would take the seat with a lead of 1% back in October, but a few weeks ago he had them leading with 11% - so high that local Conservatives wrote it off as a rogue poll. The Green Party does not have a history of electoral representation in Cheshire, but across the west of the county it will be hoping to capitalise on the controversy surrounding a number of sites given licenses for hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking. There will not be much of a media focus on the safe Tory seats of Macclesfield or Chancellor George Osborne's Tatton, where he enjoys a majority of more than 14,000. Edward Timpson even looks relatively safe in Gwyneth Dunwoody's former Labour stronghold of Crewe and Nantwich. But in Congleton and the mostly rural constituency of Eddisbury the focus may not be on the 2015 general election but that of 2020. UKIP say they have high hopes of coming second in these seats, helped by a combination of disaffected Tories and traditional Labour voters voting tactically in the aim of upsetting the Conservatives. The Lib Dems nearly tied with Labour in those safer Tory seats in 2010, and with the party widely expected to shed votes the difficult question now is which party will pick them up. Labour will be leading its march eastwards with its national rallying cries about the supposed \\"privatisation\\" of the NHS and, as they put it, the cost of living crisis. But it will be directing those appeals not just at those in more deprived parts of Chester, Runcorn and Warrington - but also at those across the county who regards themselves as being part of what they call the \\"squeezed middle\\". The Tories can point to the fact that a lot of jobs have been created in Cheshire under the coalition government, and bad news stories like the exit of AstraZeneca from its base near Macclesfield appears to have been turned into good news about the site's future. But both parties have two very difficult issues to deal with in the county - the incursion of house builders into the countryside at a time when more houses need to be built, and the role Cheshire may or may not play in the Northern Powerhouse.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose inventions always fail? from the following article ? Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

Question: What was Jack Ruby's occupation? Movie plot title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination.

He followed this act by dissolving the two chambers of the Spanish Parliament on 10 May.

A:","completion":"Based on the passage provided, here is a comprehensive question: Question: Explain the sequence of events that led to King Ferdinand's abolishment of the Constitution of 1812, and describe the political atmosphere in Spain between 1814 and 1823, including details about the restoration of the constitution during the Trienio Liberal period. Answer: King Ferdinand initially refused to go to Madrid and decided to travel to Valencia instead. Upon his arrival in Valencia on 17 April, General Elio approached the King and encouraged him to reclaim his absolute rights. General Elio offered the support of his troops for the King's cause, essentially putting the military power at Ferdinand's disposal. Subsequently, Ferdinand decided to take action and abolished the Constitution of 1812. In an attempt to further consolidate his power, the King dissolved the two chambers of the Spanish Parliament on 10 May. This marked the beginning of an absolutist rule in Spain, which lasted for six years from 1814 to 1820. However, the political atmosphere in Spain did not remain constant during this period. The constitution was eventually restored during a phase called the Trienio Liberal, which spans from 1820 to 1823. This was a three-year period when liberal government held sway in Spain, signifying a shift in the political landscape from absolutism to a more liberal approach. This change in government led to the reinstatement of the Constitution and a break from the authoritarian rule observed during the previous six years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"?","completion":"Question: According to the passage, what are the two main arguments for affirmative action as identified by Terry Eastland, and what are some potential negative consequences of affirmative action as highlighted by Thomas Sowell?

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground.

Question: What are formed where crevasses meet? Context: The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form. Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs. A:","completion":"Seracs are formed where crevasses meet.

Let's dive deeper into some possible sentiment interpretations: 1. Frustration or Disappointment: The primary sentiment that comes to mind when reading \\"and I can't eat any of it\\" is frustration or disappointment. The speaker seems to be in a situation where they are faced with food (or metaphorically a situation) they can't partake in for one reason or another. This sort of sentiment is common for people who are facing dietary restrictions due to health issues or personal choices. 2. Envy or Sadness: This sentiment also suggests feelings of envy or sadness. The author may be in a situation where they see others being able to freely enjoy something that they cannot. This could be a situation like a party or a gathering where they are unable to eat due to various reasons such as dietary restrictions, allergies, religious reasons, or personal preferences, making them feel left out. 3. Resignation or Indignation: Another way to interpret this sentiment is a sense of resignation or indignation. This can be inferred if the author is faced with a predicament where they must abstain from eating something desirable against their will, which could result from situations like a mandatory diet, fasting, or medical restrictions. However, without further context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the sentiment of this tweet. Sentiment analysis often depends heavily on additional information such as what preceded this sentence, the overall topic, or even the general tone of the person’s other social media posts. Moreover, it is crucial to note that understanding sentiment also calls for an understanding of cultural, social and personal nuances. What might sound negative or positive in one context could mean something entirely different in another. Hence, while estimates can be made about the sentiment of the tweet being negative pertaining to feelings of inability or restriction, the precise emotional undertone would require more specific context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Im so glad I can update my review of this place... Let me tell you all the past and what happened this past week. My girlfriend and I always frequent Starbucks and this is one of the locations that she is a regular at. Every day, if not twice a day, she comes here and will order a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato, no ice (because she has sensitive teeth), skinny and mixed well. What they do with no ice is that they add milk to fill it up. For almost 4 months now, she's never had a problem with that. But this last week, after getting her coffee she noticed that her usual coffee was no .75 more. What?? When asking the girl behind the window to explain, she said that was for the few ounces of milk.

A local black attorney complained in Time that the new city administration did not have enough time to confer with the various groups invested in changing the city's segregation policies. Black hotel owner A. G. Gaston agreed. A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \\"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\\".Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \\"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \\"confrontation\\". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to \\"the biggest and baddest city of the South\\". In preparation for the protests, Walker timed the walking distance from the 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters for the campaign, to the downtown area. He surveyed the segregated lunch counters of department stores, and listed federal buildings as secondary targets should police block the protesters' entrance into primary targets such as stores, libraries, and all-white churches., what would be the answer ?

Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Convince three people to sell their souls for the following movie plot: Max Devlin (Elliott Gould) is a shady landlord of a rundown tenement in Los Angeles who is rather jaded and callous towards his fellow man. One day while chasing an errant tenant, he is run over by a bus and killed. He descends into hell (which resembles a corporate business) and meets the Devil's chief henchman Barney Satin (Bill Cosby). He is told of his life of sin and the fact that he is doomed to spend eternity at a section called Level 4. However, he is given a chance to save himself by convincing three other people to sell their souls in exchange for his. Max returns to Earth and begins his frantic quest with two months (ending on May 15) to complete his mission. Barney appears frequently throughout the movie to check up on Max's progress as well as both taunt and persuade him to carry out the plans. A running joke is that nobody, except Max, can see or hear Barney.In addition to being temporarily alive, Max soon learns that he casts no reflection when he looks into any mirror. Barney tells Max that by a signed contract his soul belongs to him unless he completes his mission. Barney further explains to Max the conditions to get the three young people to sell their souls before the deadline and that Max will be given limited mystical powers which are called \\"magic property\\" to convince his three targets that they have special talents. The magic property lasts only as long as Max and the subjects are within sight of each other. Once Max completes his mission, his soul will be free and the three subjects will continue to live until the natural end of their lives.Max's three targets are: Stella Summers (Julie Budd), a 19-year-old high school dropout and aspiring singer who has dreams to make it big; Nerve Nordlinger (David Knell), a 16-year-old high school geek whom has dreams to be popular by becoming a dirt motorbike champion racer; Toby Hart (Adam Rich) is an 11-year-old boy who dreams of having a father figure in his life in order to make his widowed mother, Penny (Susan Anspach), happy again.

When this happens, the first steps of vitamin d synthesis in your body is triggered. Choose your answer from: -In addition, the most powerful blue rays that cause vitamin d are found in the sun. Your uvb radiation travels through your entire body including your skin and gets to the spot where you are prone to sunburn.; -Your skin reacts directly to uvb rays.

Because the rest takes place inside the body, once the body is triggered, you no longer need to be exposed to uvb radiation.; -Ultraviolet a (uva) is the active radiation that is produced by the sun, but is not useful for biosynthesis.

Which entity is this text about? Michael Craig Judge (born October 17, 1962) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director and musician. Judge is the creator of the television series Beavis and Butt-Head (1993-97, 2011), and co-creator of the television series King of the Hill (1997-2010), The Goode Family (2009), Silicon Valley (2014-present), and Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus (2017). He also wrote and directed the films Beavis and Butt-Head Do America (1996), Office Space (1999), Idiocracy (2006) and Extract (2009). Raised in New Mexico, Judge graduated from University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics. He graduated in 1986 from University of California, San Diego. In 1987, he moved to Silicon Valley to join Parallax Graphics, a startup video card company with about 40 employees based in Santa Clara. Disliking the company's culture and his colleagues (\\"The people I met were like Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was\\"), Judge quit after less than three months and became a bass player with a touring blues band. He was a part of Anson Funderburgh's band for two years, playing on their 1990 Black Top Records release \\"Rack 'Em Up\\", while taking graduate math classes at the University of Texas at Dallas. In 1989, after seeing animation cels on display in a movie theater, Judge purchased a Bolex 16 mm film camera and began creating his own animated shorts. In 1991, his short film \\"Office Space\\" (also known as the Milton series of shorts) was acquired by Comedy Central, following an animation festival in Dallas. In the early 1990s, he was playing blues bass with Doyle Bramhall. In 1992, he developed Frog Baseball, a short film featuring the characters Beavis and Butt-Head, to be featured on Liquid Television, a 1990s animation showcase that appeared on MTV. The short led to the creation of the Beavis and Butt-Head series on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent, heavy metal-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, Beavis and Butt-Head (both voiced by Judge), who go to High School at Highland High in Albuquerque, New Mexico (the same city where Judge was raised and attended high school). The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run, Beavis and Butt-Head drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society. Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two - Blood Drive/Give Blood and Door to Door - which he described as \\"awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand.\\" The series spawned the feature-length film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America and the spin-off show Daria. After two decades, the series aired its new season on October 27, 2011. The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers. On January 10, 2014, Judge announced that there is still a chance to pitch Beavis and Butt-Head to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes.","completion":"This text is about Michael Craig Judge, also known as Mike Judge.

Does confidence mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, confidence has different meanings in these two sentences. Although both sentences use the word 'confidence,' each context reveals a distinct connotation and interpretation. In Sentence 1, confidence refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully accomplish a task or handle a situation. It can also be associated with one's self-assurance, self-esteem, or self-efficacy. The phrase \\"Confidence is always borrowed, never owned\\" emphasizes that a person's confidence may be affected by external factors, such as validation, support, or feedback from others. This suggests that confidence is something temporary or situational, rather than an inherent or permanent trait. It implies that individuals might need to continually work on maintaining, regaining, or building confidence based on their experiences and interactions with others. In Sentence 2, confidence takes on a different meaning, associated with trust, secrecy, and privacy. In this context, the word 'confidences' refers to the personal and private information that individuals share with one another based on a foundation of trust. When \\"everyone trusted him with their confidences,\\" it implies that the individual is deemed trustworthy and reliable, so people feel comfortable confiding their secrets, feelings, or sensitive information. This meaning of confidence is not related to the belief in one's ability or self-assurance, but rather focuses on the trustworthiness of the individual, who becomes the custodian of others' secrets. In summary, Sentence 1 uses 'confidence' to represent self-belief or self-assurance, while Sentence 2 employs the term to refer to the trust and private information people share with a trustworthy person. Although both sentences use the same word, they communicate different meanings based on their respective contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Upon entering a trapped room, he is sprayed with a liquid that rapidly melts his entire body. The rooms in the Cube are being monitored from a remote observation room by two technicians, Eric Wynn and Dodd, who are unaware of who their employers are. The pair are shown playing chess during work, whereupon Wynn demonstrates mental calculator abilities which he uses to predict Dodd's moves.

Swirl the two together with a spoon until they’re fully mixed. The antibacterial soap will kill any germs or bacteria on the brushes, while the olive oil will help break down stubborn makeup so the brushes rinse clean. Don’t use a paper plate for mixing the cleaner. The oil will seep through paper. Take the brushes that you plan to clean and run them under lukewarm water. Run your fingers over the bristles to ensure that they’re all completely wet. Be careful to hold the brushes with the bristles facing down when you wet them. If water gets inside the brushes’ ferrell, the part of the brushes just below the bristles that holds them to the handle, it may loosen the glue so bristles start falling out. Coat all of the brushes’ bristles with the soap mixture. Next, run the brushes back and forth over the palm of your hand to work the cleaner in. Keep moving the brushes over your hand until the suds are no longer colored with makeup. For extremely dirty makeup brushes, you may need to wipe off the suds and dip the brushes in the cleaner a second time. Once the soapy residue is no longer colored, run the brushes under lukewarm water until no suds come out of the bristles. Gently reshape the wet bristles with your fingers, and lay them flat to air dry. If possible, lay your brushes flat on the edge of a table or counter so the bristles hang over the edge. That will keep any moisture from seeping into the ferrule. Summary:","completion":"To clean makeup brushes, mix 2 parts antibacterial dish soap and 1 part olive oil on a small, non-paper plate.

Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization.

This camp screwball comedy of errors, that includes many over-the-top stereotypes, is set at Halloween against the backdrop of West Hollywood, California. Five friends, interior designer Evan (played by London); interior designer Harvey (played by Cheng); African American stockbroker Dave (played by Meadows); Latino spinning instructor Fredrico (played by Sabàto); and Emme (played by Ubach), a sassy young woman obsessed with style and classic movies, have all been anticipating the West Hollywood Halloween Parade on Santa Monica Boulevard, which is the biggest and brashest block party of the year. Their annual tradition of joining the festivities in outrageous costumes has become part of local legend. It is the night before Halloween, however, and they still have not decided what to be. Evan and Harvey, who are femme gay boyfriends and business partners, have come up with food-themed sushi costumes that everyone refers to as \\"wasabi tuna.\\" Emme offers another suggestion — that they all dress up as gang members. They all opt for the gang theme, but are unable to find the appropriate attire at the local stores. They then decide to seek out real life gang members in order to achieve the authentic, straight-from-the-hood look they want. While doing interior design work for an extremely wealthy Armenian woman who is actually in the illegal drug trade, Harvey and Evan become unwitting drug couriers. After they are arrested, there is a comic scene at the WeHo sheriff's station with them attempting to talk their way out of trouble. Dave goes to East L.A., where he comes across a real gang member named Romeo (played by Díaz). He makes a deal with Romeo to loan him his Porsche in exchange for his lowrider gang car.

Context: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" Question: How does Obama feel about the museum?

Since 's' is being multiplied by -1, we can simply multiply -3 by -1 to get the value of 's'. -3 multiplied by -1 is 3 (because when we multiply two negative numbers, we get a positive number).

The library's ranking is largely due to its vast and diverse collections, which consist of numerous valuable and rare items from both Chinese and world history. Established in 1902, Nanjing University Library has grown and expanded over the years, making significant contributions to academic research and education. As of now, the library has a total collection of more than six million volumes, including approximately 1.4 million digital resources. These resources cover a wide range of subjects, supporting research and learning across various disciplines. One of the key factors contributing to the high ranking of Nanjing University Library is its abundant collection of precious works. The library houses around 1.95 million ancient books, the most valuable of which are over 50,000 volumes of old thread-bound Chinese books. Furthermore, the library includes a number of rare manuscripts and inscribed stone tablets dating back as far as the Qin and Han Dynasties. Another aspect that highlights Nanjing University Library's prominence among Chinese libraries is the Modern Chinese Document Archives. These archives contain important historical documents, official records, and personal writings from the early 20th century to the present day, providing researchers a unique insight into contemporary Chinese history. In conclusion, although the Nanjing University Library is the second largest university library in China, it is the fifth largest nationwide. Its ranking can be attributed to the library's impressive collection, both in terms of size and value, as well as its dedication to preserving and providing access to precious works from Chinese and world history. This makes the library an essential resource for academic research and learning in the country and beyond."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer the following question: What is the name of the person that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not for vote for in either of his presidential runs? Answer the above question based on the context below: Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

Plot title: The Thing That Couldn't Die Movie plot: A young woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney), who claims to have psychic powers, lives on a remote ranch with her Aunt Flavia (Peggy Converse). She discovers an ancient box while water-witching and her Aunt takes it back to their house. Her boyfriend, Gordon (William Reynolds), goes for an archaeologist, arguing the box should be kept intact for appraisal and opening by an expert. However, the Aunt's greedy ranch foreman, anticipating treasure, secretly convinces the slow-witted handyman to break it open. Instead, the box contains the intact head of Gideon Drew (Robin Hughes), a man executed for sorcery 400 years earlier. The head awakens and telepathically takes over the mentally vulnerable handyman. After murdering the foreman, the head has the handyman conceal it while arranging to have a coffin retrieved containing Gideon's body. After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman. The police had arrived to investigate the theft of the box's remains and the blood left behind from the killing of the foreman. Failing to stop, the handyman died in a hail of police bullets. Once his head and body are joined, Gideon will be fully able to exercise his powers over all comers. The young woman is aware of the evil and is protected from the head's influence by an ancient cross she wears around her neck, but when her boyfriend removes it, to make a cast so its historical value could be appraised, the head takes control of her mind. So, ironically, though the guest under control of the head was unable to remove it, Jessica was put in harms way by her protector. Jessica then helps find the head's body, previously being against doing so since they only wished to make money out of it as well as fear that it was an evil business. The young woman joins head to body and Gideon arises from his coffin, but the boyfriend, aware of the error of his ways, catches the monster... My question: Why does Jessica take off her cross?

He urged the Federal Government and society as a whole to work together with the Muslim community instead of isolating them and relying on scaremongering tactics. \\"If the government is genuinely concerned about Australia's security, they need to invest in working collaboratively with the Muslim community and its leaders, listening to their experiences and insights, and tackling the root causes of radicalization,\\" Mr. Trad said. \\"Maintaining a rigid, adversarial approach will only push those we need to reach further away and provide fertile ground for extremists to exploit.\\" Many members of the Muslim community feel marginalized and believe that their voices are not being heard. There is a growing number of community leaders, like Mr. Trad, who are attempting to bridge the gap and encourage the government to cooperate with them in addressing the issue together. In response to the potential heightened alert status, Mr. Trad stated that while national security should be a priority, it should not come at the expense, or further alienation, of any group of citizens. He called on all Australians to unite against fear and to avoid targeting specific communities, which can lead to further radicalization. \\"Let us stand together as Australians, regardless of faith, ethnicity, or social background and work together to find the solutions we need,\\" the IFAA founder concluded. \\"Only through unity and understanding can we effectively counter the threat of extremism and create an inclusive, supportive society where all members feel valued and safe.\\" As the government reviews its counter-terrorism measures and debates regarding the construction of mosques continue, it is crucial that open dialogues and cooperation between the authorities and community leaders are maintained.

It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - The canton of Valais is one of the 26 cantons of Switzerland, situated in the southwestern part of the country, around the valley of the Rhône from its headwaters to Lake Geneva, separating the Pennine Alps from the Bernese Alps. The canton is simultaneously one of the driest regions of Switzerland in its central Rhône valley and among the wettest, having large amounts of snow and rain up on the highest peaks found in Switzerland.

Tradition considers him a member of the Theban Legion , but instead of being martyred with this legion at Agaunum ( in present - day Switzerland ) , he escaped to Piedmont and was martyred there . A 14th - century account relates that , around 522 , a man fell from a precipice near Crissolo but remained unharmed . The local population attributed his being unharmed to relics discovered by a peasant plowing in the vicinity - a discovery attributed to divine intervention . The mysterious skeleton was given the name of \`\` San Ciafrè '' and the tomb became the focus of a celebrated sanctuary at Crissolo . The first documentary evidence pointing to a cult devoted to Chiaffredo dates from 1387 , when Avignon Pope Clement VII granted indulgences to those who visited the church at Crissolo and helped in its repair . A late 16th century legend written down by Guglielmo Baldesano states that Chiaffredo or Teofredo , soldier of the Theban Legion , escaped to Piedmont to avoid sacrificing to pagan idols and was martyred at Crissolo around 270 . Fabio Arduino believes this story to have no historical foundation , as it would have been unlikely for a Roman legionary of the 3rd century to bear such a clearly Germanic name . The name is a variant of Theudofridus , derived from the Germanic theuda - \`\` people , '' and frithu - \`\` peace . '' The sepulcher identified as the saint 's burial place may have been a tomb of pagan origins . Similar to the cults of Saint Constantius at Crissolo , Saint Bessus at Val Soana , Saint Tegulus at Ivrea , Saint Magnus at Castelmagno , and Saint Dalmatius at Borgo San Dalmazzo , the cult of Saint Chiaffredo was linked with that of the Theban Legion to lend antiquity to a local saint about whom nothing was really known . In 1902 , a scholar identified Chiaffredo as the 8th century figure St.... - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes.

Question: What do they call someone born of a parent who practiced witchcraft? Movie title: The Craft Movie plot: Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty. It becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back are completely healed by an experimental gene therapy, Laura loses her hair, and Nancy's abusive stepfather has a heart attack and dies, leaving a large insurance policy which makes her mother rich.

One of these is the classic ensemble of a white shirt and skirt, elegantly complemented by a vest, tie, robe, socks, and shoes. Though it may sound simple, putting together the perfect outfit requires careful consideration and an understanding of the various elements involved. In this article, we will walk you through a step-by-step process of putting together this charming, timeless look that transcends seasons and occasions. Step 1: Wear a white shirt: The cornerstone of this timeless ensemble is a clean, crisp white shirt. A white shirt is versatile and provides the perfect canvas to build your outfit around. Consider opting for a high-quality fabric to ensure comfort and longevity, such as Egyptian or sea island cotton. Additionally, choose a well-fitted shirt that accentuates your body's features without appearing too tight or baggy. Step 2: Find a skirt: Select a skirt that complements your white shirt. Skirts come in a variety of shapes, lengths, and materials, so make sure you pick one that suits your preferences and the occasion you plan to wear it for. A knee-length or slightly below the knee pencil skirt can be an excellent choice for a more formal setting, while a free-flowing midi-skirt can add a touch of elegance to your outfit if you prefer a more relaxed style. Look for skirts in neutral tones such as black, gray, or beige so that they can be easily coordinated with your remaining ensemble. Step 3: Choose a vest and tie: Accessorizing your outfit with a vest and tie adds a touch of sophistication and polish to your look. The vest should be tailored to fit comfortably over the white shirt and not overpower the rest of the outfit. When choosing the right tie, keep in mind that it should either match the dominant color of your skirt or provide a pleasing contrast. You may also opt for a timeless pattern like pinstripe, but be cautious not to choose a pattern that is too busy or overwhelming. Step 4: Select socks and shoes: Your choice of footwear should keep both comfort and style in mind. Depending on the formality of the event, you may choose to wear pumps or high heels, flats, or even a more casual pair of loafers. Neutral colors or shades that complement your outfit would be ideal. As for socks, opt for styles that either match your shoes or provide a subtle contrast. Consider materials like fine wool or cashmere for extra comfort and a touch of luxury. Step 5: Wear a robe: Draping a robe over your ensemble brings an extra layer of refinement and elegance to your outfit. Choose a breathable fabric with a graceful drape, such as silk or satin. The color of your robe should either harmonize with or accentuate the other elements of your ensemble. For an added touch of sophistication, consider wearing a robe with subtle embroidery or a minimalistic pattern. Conclusion: Assembling a classy ensemble that includes a white shirt, skirt, vest, tie, robe, socks, and shoes may be a simple process, but it requires a keen attention to detail and an understanding of style. By following this step-by-step guide, you can create a timeless look that is both fashionable and sophisticated, effortlessly taking you from the boardroom to a gala or from a day at the office to an evening out on the town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years.

The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Today, we are going to learn how to make a delicious and warm ginger-cinnamon drink. This drink is perfect for a cold day or when you're feeling a little under the weather. First, let's talk about the two main ingredients: ginger and cinnamon. Ginger is a root that looks a bit like a funky, twisted hand. It has a spicy and zingy taste. Cinnamon comes from the bark of a tree that's been dried and curled into sticks. It smells and tastes sweet and warm. Now, let's make our ginger-cinnamon drink! Step 1: Prepare the ingredients We are going to start by getting our ginger and cinnamon ready to use. First, we need to coarsely grate the ginger. This means we take a piece of ginger and rub it against a grater with big holes to make small, chunky pieces. Be careful not to hurt your fingers! Next, we're going to lightly crush the cinnamon stick. Crushing the cinnamon will help our drink get more flavor. You can ask a grown-up to help you with this. They can put the cinnamon in a plastic bag and gently hit it with a rolling pin or the bottom of a cup. Step 2: Simmer the ingredients Now that our ginger and cinnamon are prepared, we need to cook them. We'll put both the ginger and cinnamon in a pot with some water or another liquid like apple juice. Then, we're going to turn the stove's burner to medium heat. This helps the water become hot, but not too hot. We will let our drink simmer, which means it will cook slowly with little bubbles in the water. We'll do this for about 20 minutes. This will help the ginger and cinnamon release their yummy flavors into the water and make our drink taste amazing! Step 3: Enjoy your drink After 20 minutes, our ginger-cinnamon drink should be ready. We need to be very careful because the liquid will be hot. With the help of an adult, you can strain the drink, which means you will pour it through a small strainer to remove the pieces of ginger and cinnamon.

As a huge WWII buff, I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. It is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narrating by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about WWII, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. Especially with the information about Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. That information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR.

The excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating, particularly to a western audience. At times I actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was totally past caring. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of China (and is by the way no stranger to Chinese cinema), I couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into. It begs the question: If I disliked it, who on earth would like it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen.

Beginning as a series of scattered rural riots in late 1323, peasant insurrection escalated into a full-scale rebellion that dominated public affairs in Flanders for nearly five years until 1328. The uprising in Flanders was caused by both excessive taxations levied by the Count of Flanders Louis I, and by his pro-French policies. The insurrection had urban leaders and rural factions which took over most of Flanders by 1325. The revolt was led by Nicolaas Zannekin, a rich farmer from Lampernisse. Zannekin and his men captured the towns of Nieuwpoort, Veurne, Ypres and Kortrijk. In Kortrijk, Zannekin was able to capture the count himself. In 1325, attempts to capture Gent and Oudenaarde failed. The King of France, Charles IV intervened, whereupon Louis was released from captivity in February 1326 and the Peace of Arques was sealed. The peace soon failed, and the count fled to France when more hostilities erupted. Louis convinced his new liege Philip VI of France to come to his aid, and Zannekin and his adherents were decisively defeated by the French royal army in the Battle of Cassel.

Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

Storm) is a Japanese boy band consisting of five members formed under the Johnny & Associates talent agency. The members are Ohno Satoshi, Sakurai Sho, Aiba Masaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, and Matsumoto Jun. Arashi officially formed on September 15, 1999, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and made their debut CD on November 3, 1999.

Then-president Johnny Kitagawa chose five trainees from the Johnny's Jr. division of the agency to become the members of Arashi, the Japanese word for Storm, and to represent the agency's thrust of \\"creating a storm throughout the world\\". On November 3, 1999, they made their CD debut by releasing the single \\"Arashi\\", which became the theme song for the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup hosted by Japan in 1999. It went on to become a major hit, selling 557,430 copies in its first week and almost a million copies by the end of its chart run. On April 5, 2000, Arashi released their second single, \\"Sunrise Nippon/Horizon\\", which debuted at number-one on the Oricon weekly singles chart selling 304,340 copies.

Question: Little sarah didn't think that anyone should be kissing boys. She thought that boys had what? Options: - arousal - disease - sweet - halatosis - cooties Explain why a human would choose \\"cooties\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Cooties\\" The choice of \\"cooties\\" as the answer to this question stems from a culturally ingrained notion that has often been used by children to express their initial aversion to the opposite gender. To understand why a human would choose \\"cooties\\" over the other options, it is essential to explore the concept of cooties, its cultural significance, and its connection to the mindset of a young child like Little Sarah. Cooties are an imaginary, fictional germ that children believe they can catch from members of the opposite sex. The idea of cooties has been prevalent in many cultures, particularly in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The origin of the term \\"cooties\\" can be traced back to World War I, where it was used to describe lice that infested soldiers in the trenches. Over time, this term has evolved and become popular among children. As children grow up and begin to notice the differences between boys and girls, they might feel shy, awkward, or confused about interacting with the opposite gender. This is especially true during the early stages of adolescence when they start to develop opinions on romantic relationships. To cope with this uncertainty, children create a playful narrative of contagion, in which they may attribute catching cooties to touching or being in close proximity with members of the opposite sex. In the context of Little Sarah's thoughts on kissing boys, her belief that boys have cooties reflects her innocence and her lack of understanding of the complexities of relationships. Choosing \\"cooties\\" instead of the other available options highlights her age-appropriate concerns and coping mechanisms. Furthermore, Little Sarah's mindset is consistent with many children her age who are trying to navigate their social environment and understand boundaries between genders. The other options provided - arousal, disease, sweet, and halatosis - may not resonate with her age group and cognitive development stage. Arousal and halatosis are complex terminologies that a young child might not comprehend. Disease might seem far-fetched for her to connect with kissing boys, and sweet might not capture her aversion toward kissing. Therefore, a human would choose \\"cooties\\" to answer the question because it best captures the essence of Little Sarah's thoughts on kissing boys and accurately reflects a common mindset among children her age. The term \\"cooties\\" effectively encompasses her innocence, her attempts to navigate relationships at a young age, and her playful approach to understanding the opposite gender."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I had heard mixed reviews prior to my visit, but I wanted to give it a chance since it's close to my workplace. Unfortunately, my experience can only be described as disappointing, with sub-par food and inattentive service as the main culprits. Upon entering, I was greeted by a host who showed me to my table. The ambiance was decent, and the restaurant was clean, but the mood quickly shifted when it took nearly 15 minutes for the server to approach our table and take our orders. I understand that restaurants can be busy, but it wasn't too crowded during our visit, and there seemed to be plenty of staff members working. We decided to start with the artichoke dip as an appetizer. Unfortunately, the dip had a strange aftertaste and was lukewarm when it arrived at our table, leading me to think it wasn't freshly made. To top it off, the portion size was quite small, despite the dish being sold as a sharing platter. For my entree, I ordered the pan-seared salmon with a side of veggies and steamed rice. While the salmon was cooked well on the outside, it was borderline raw in the center, and the presentation was far from decent. Furthermore, the side of veggies was visibly overcooked and tasted bland, adding to the overall lackluster nature of the dish. My dining partner went for the steak, which they requested medium-rare but received well-done. It was accompanied by mashed potatoes that were mediocre at best and seemed as though they came from a box. Though the steak was of decent quality, it was evident that the dish did not receive the attention required to ensure an enjoyable dining experience. Moreover, throughout our meal, our server seemed preoccupied and rarely checked in to see if we needed anything or to inquire about our thoughts on the dishes. We had to flag down another server to request drink refills and condiments. It definitely made us feel as though our business wasn't valued. Even though I wanted to provide The Bistro Hub with the benefit of the doubt, the combination of mediocre food and subpar service made it impossible for me to justify returning to the establishment. Disappointment would be an understatement, and I feel compelled to share my experience. Hopefully, management takes note and works on improving their offerings, but until then, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone in the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sent 2: Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. Sent 3: We might call it the first Chinese invention. Sent 4: Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Sent 5: Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. Sent 6: He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Sent 7: Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. Sent 8: And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Sent 9: Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. Sent 10: The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Sent 11: Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. Sent 12: The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. Sent 13: This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. Sent 14: And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. Sent 15: During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Sent 16: Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. Sent 17: And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. Sent 18: The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Question: Peking Man achieved a mastery of fire in what is currently which nation?. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the main focus of the question. Usage: The question asks about the current nation where Peking Man achieved a mastery of fire. This helps to identify which sentence in the paragraph contains the relevant information. Part #2: Identify the sentence containing the information about Peking Man and his mastery of fire. Usage: \\"Sent 2: Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire.\\" This sentence mentions Peking Man's mastery of fire and is the starting point to find the nation's information. Part #3: Locate the information about the geographical location of Peking Man. Usage: \\"Sent 8: And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down.\\" This sentence provides the location where Peking Man achieved his mastery of fire. Part #4: Link the geographical location to its corresponding nation. Usage: Since the location is mentioned to be southwest of present-day Beijing, it is clear that the current nation is China. This is the answer to the question. Sample Response: Peking Man achieved a mastery of fire in what is currently China. This meets the criteria as the paragraph mentions the location to be southwest of present-day Beijing, which is in China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: Cut a skinny strip out of white crepe paper or tissue paper. Fold it in half several times, then cut a long, skinny petal shape out of it. This should give you several petals. Repeat this step until you have about 20 to 24 petals. Have the petals taper into a skinny tab at the bottom so that you can secure them more easily. If you used crepe paper, you can gently pull the petals apart at the center to widen them. If you used tissue paper, you can fold the petals over a toothpick or skewer lengthwise to create a slight crease. Make the petals more realistic by cutting a notch into the tip Begin by cutting a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) tall rectangle from green tissue paper or crepe paper. Next, cut a jagged, grass-like fringe into one of the long edges. This will make the base of the daisy and help cover up the bottom part of the petals. Plan on making the rectangle about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long. You can always trim it down later if it's too long. Begin by folding a piece of green tissue or crepe paper in half. Cut a half-oval out of it, then cut notches into the curved edge of the oval. Unfold the oval to reveal your leaf. You can make as many leaves as you want. 2 to 3 would be ideal, however. Summary:","completion":"The article provides instructions on making a paper daisy. First, create 20 to 24 skinny petals by cutting and folding white crepe or tissue paper.

Translate to Russian","completion":"Баланс также может содержать статьи активов, чья фактическая стоимость отличается от указанной. Балансовый отчет является одним из основных финансовых документов, который отражает финансовое состояние компании или организации на определенную дату. Он состоит из двух частей: активов и пассивов. Активы включают все ресурсы, которыми обладает компания, а пассивы представляют собой обязательства перед внешними сторонами. Важно отметить, что активы и пассивы всегда должны соответствовать друг другу, то есть быть уравновешенными. Однако бывают случаи, когда активы балансового отчета могут содержать статьи, чья фактическая стоимость отличается от указанной. Это может произойти по ряду причин, таких как ошибки, изменение стоимости активов из-за инфляции, устаревание оборудования, снижение стоимости акций и многое другое. В таких случаях компания должна провести переоценку активов, чтобы определить их реальную стоимость и, при необходимости, скорректировать балансовый отчет. Переоценка активов обычно проводится специалистами-оценщиками, которые, опираясь на различные методы оценки, выявляют текущую стоимость активов и сравнивают ее с указанной в балансе. Если обнаружены значительные отклонения, компания должна отразить этот факт в своем финансовом отчете. Иногда компании могут намеренно искажать реальную стоимость активов, чтобы улучшить свою финансовую картику или уклониться от налогов. В таких ситуациях роли контрольных органов, таких как налоговые инспекции и аудиторы, становятся еще более значимыми, так как они несут ответственность за проверку и контроль правильности составления и представления финансовой отчетности. В целом, искажение стоимости активов в балансовом отчете может иметь серьезные последствия как для компании, так и для сторонних инвесторов и кредиторов, которые опираются на эту информацию при принятии решений о сотрудничестве или инвестициях.

Information: - A prologue or prolog ( Greek prólogos , from pro , \`\` before '' and lógos , \`\` word '' ) is an opening to a story that establishes the setting and gives background details , often some earlier story that ties into the main one , and other miscellaneous information . The Ancient Greek prólogos included the modern meaning of prologue , but was of wider significance , more like the meaning of preface . The importance , therefore , of the prologue in Greek drama was very great ; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance , to which , or to an episode in which , the play itself succeeded . It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides , and with him , as has been said , it takes the place of an explanatory first act . This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue , as an impertinence , a useless growth prefixed to the play , and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it . The point precisely is that , to an Athenian audience , it was useful and pertinent , as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible . But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man , because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it . He seems , in such a typical prologue as that to the Hippolytus , to be accepting a conventional formula , and employing it , almost perversely , as a medium for his ironic rationalismo . - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - A preface or proem is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a \\"foreword\\" and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work. - A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells. Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.

First, let's combine the t terms on the right side of the equation. So we get: 33*t - 84 = (-3 - 6)*t => 33*t - 84 = -9*t Now let's move the -9*t from the right side to the left side by adding 9*t to both sides. This way, we can get all the t terms together: 33*t + 9*t - 84 = 0 => 42*t - 84 = 0 Now we want to get t by itself, so let's move the -84 to the right side by adding 84 to both sides: 42*t = 84 Now we want to find out how many times 42 must be multiplied to get 84.

As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him.

Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"garage floor\\" and \\"gravel parking lot\\". A:","completion":"The car moves more smoothly into the garage than the parking lot because there is a bumpier surface in the \\"gravel parking lot.\\" When a car drives on a gravel parking lot, the rough and irregular surface of the gravel contributes to a bumpier and less even ride. The gravel is made up of uneven stones and rocks, which can interfere with the smoothness of the car's movement as the tires have to traverse the inconsistent terrain. This can result in a rougher driving experience and requires the vehicle's suspension system to work harder in order to maintain the car's stability. On the other hand, the garage floor is typically made of a smoother and more even material, such as concrete. This surface is free from the inconsistencies and irregularities of a gravel parking lot. As a result, the car can move more smoothly and effortlessly when it transitions from the bumpy gravel parking lot to the more uniform garage floor. The smoothness of the garage floor not only provides a more comfortable driving experience but also minimizes any potential damage to the vehicle caused by continuous exposure to uneven surfaces, such as straining the suspension system or causing premature wear on the tires. For these reasons, it is clear that the bumpier surface resides in the gravel parking lot, and the garage floor offers a smoother and more level driving experience."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The town is an important tourist destination known as Zell am See-Kaprun and is a transportation hub for the region. - A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski. - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A piste is a marked ski run or path down a mountain for snow skiing, snowboarding, or other mountain sports. - The Ski Amadé region of Austria is a network of 28 ski areas and towns that combined, make up the second largest ski area in Europe. It is named after the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who was born in the city of Salzburg. - Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS). - A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means. - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\"). - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - International Ski Federation (FIS; short for Fédération Internationale de Ski) is the world's highest governing body for international winter sports. Founded in 1924, it is responsible for the Olympic disciplines of Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined, freestyle skiing and snowboarding. The FIS is also responsible for setting the international competition rules. The organization now has a membership of 118 national ski associations and is based in Oberhofen am Thunersee, Switzerland. - An international airport is an airport that offers customs and immigration facilities for passengers travelling between countries. International airports are typically larger than domestic airports and often feature longer runways and facilities to accommodate the heavier aircraft commonly used for international and intercontinental travel. International airports often also host domestic flights. Some, such as Frankfurt Airport in Germany are very large; others such as Fa'a' International Airport in Tahiti, are quite small. - Salzburg (literally: \\"Salt Fortress\\") is the fourth-largest city in Austria and the capital of the federal state of Salzburg. - Saalbach - Hinterglemm is a municipality in the district of Zell am See ( Pinzgau region ) , in the Austrian state of Salzburg . It is well known for its skiing and other winter sports . A three piste network consisting of Saalbach , Hinterglemm and Leogang is located in the municipality . It is short transfer to resort from Salzburg Airport . - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - Salzburg Airport is the second largest international airport in Austria. It serves Salzburg, the fourth-largest Austrian city, as well as a gateway to Austria's numerous and vast ski areas, including the Ski Amadé region, the largest network of linked ski resorts in Europe. The airport is named after Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and is located west-southwest from the centre of Salzburg and from the Austrian-German border and is jointly owned by the City of Salzburg (25%) and The State of Salzburg (75%). - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - The Bezirk Zell am See is an administrative district (\\"Bezirk\\") in the federal state of Salzburg, Austria, and congruent with the Pinzgau region. - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (; 27 January 1756 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: Opposite charges attract, and like charges repel. Q: What do opposite charges do to one another? Choices: - strengthen - weaken - repel - attract A:","completion":"The answer is 'attract'. In the context of electric charges, as per the provided paragraph, opposite charges attract one another. This is a fundamental principle of electrostatics, often summarized as \\"opposites attract, likes repel.\\" So, when you have two charges that are opposite, meaning one is positively charged and the other is negatively charged, they will be attracted to each other. This attraction is due to the electric force between them which pulls them together. The greater the charges and the closer they are to each other, the stronger this force of attraction will be. Therefore, given the choices - strengthen, weaken, repel, and attract, the correct answer to the question of what do opposite charges do to one another would be they 'attract'. This principle plays a vital role in various natural and technological phenomena, ranging from the formation of atoms and chemical compounds to the functioning of many electronic devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Semiconductors can be constructed that do not conduct current in one particular direction. When a voltage is applied in that direction, current flows only when ionization is produced by radiation, similar to what happens in a Geiger tube. Further, the amount of current in a solid-state detector is closely related to the energy deposited and, since the detector is solid, it can have a high efficiency (since ionizing radiation is stopped in a shorter distance in solids fewer particles escape detection). As with scintillators, very sophisticated information can be obtained from solid-state detectors.

Given the question: Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible. Question: suppose the bones are put underground more quickly happens, how will it affect animals eat more of the bones. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"B: less If the bones are buried more quickly, it will have an effect on the number of bones available for animals to consume. When bones are put underground faster, they are not exposed and accessible to scavengers for as long of a time period. As a result, fewer animals will have the opportunity to find and consume the bones. When an organism dies, scavengers, such as vultures, hyenas, and insects, play a crucial role in breaking down the body and consuming the soft tissue. The bones might take longer to break down, giving scavengers the chance to consume or gather them when they're still on the surface. If the bones are buried more quickly, scavengers will have a reduced chance of finding the bones and will consequently eat less of them overall. In addition to making the bones less available for consumption, the faster burial can also preserve more of the bones from being eaten. The faster burial can protect the bones from being scattered or damaged by scavengers that could have otherwise further broken them apart or carried them off, which would impact the chances of fossilization. However, it is important to note that while faster burial may affect the amount of bones consumed by scavengers, the overall impact on the scavengers might not be significant. Scavengers are opportunistic feeders, meaning they consume a variety of food sources, and bones are just one of many. The reduced availability of bones due to faster burial would likely have a minimal effect on the overall diet and behavior of these scavengers. In conclusion, if the bones are buried underground more quickly, it will cause a decrease in the number of bones consumed by animals, as the bones will be less available and accessible for scavengers to find and eat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dion Dublin (born 22 April 1969) is an English former footballer and television presenter. Born in Leicester and of Nigerian descent, he was capped four times for England. Dublin started his career as a centre-back with Norwich City, but made his name at Cambridge United as a centre-forward. He had spells with Norwich City, Cambridge United, Manchester United, Coventry City, Millwall, Aston Villa, Leicester City and Celtic. On 20 September 2006, Norwich City announced that Dublin had joined them until the end of the 2006-07 season. It marked a return, almost 20 years after leaving, for Dublin to the club where he began his career. He made his debut on 23 September 2006 when he came on as substitute against Plymouth Argyle. He scored his first competitive goal in Norwich City colours in a 3-3 draw against Queens Park Rangers on 14 October 2006 at Loftus Road. Steve Wilson cited Dublin as the main inspiration behind Norwich's 4-1 FA Cup 3rd Round win at Tamworth, in which the striker scored two goals and set up numerous chances for other teammates. Dublin was an important figure in Norwich securing safety from relegation to League One and the supporters recognised his contribution by voting him in second place in the Norwich City player of the year award, and on 23 May 2007 he ended speculation about his future by signing a new one-year contract at Norwich, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2007-08 season. On 2 September 2007, Dublin, whilst a pundit on the Aston Villa v Chelsea game, said that this season would be his last as a footballer, citing the fact that his 'bones have started to talk to him' as the reason, meaning that he did not think his body can handle another season. During Spring 2008, Dublin was approached by Jimmy Quinn, then manager of Cambridge United, about joining his old club for the 2008-09 season. However, the player would not change his mind about retiring. He was voted the club's Player of the Year and awarded the Barry Butler trophy on 26 April 2008 in his final season as a footballer, at his penultimate game, and on his final appearance at Carrow Road. Dublin played his final game on 4 May 2008, featuring in Norwich's 4-1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in front of 36,208 fans at Hillsborough - the highest Championship attendance that season. When he was taken off in the 66th minute, Dublin received a standing ovation from both sets of supporters, players and referee Mark Clattenburg.

A child on board the plane, George, disappears into the jungle and is raised by a sapient, talking gorilla named Ape. Twenty-five years later, George, who enjoys swinging on vines to move about but has a habit of crashing into trees, has grown to be King of the Jungle. Ursula Stanhope, a San Francisco heiress, tours Uganda with local guide Kwame and a trio of porters. Ursula is tracked down and joined by her fiancé, Lyle Van De Groot, with two poachers named Max and Thor. Kwame tells the group of the \\"White Ape\\", a local legend of a superhuman primate that rules the jungle. The next day Lyle, insistent on taking Ursula home as soon as possible, goes into the jungle with her to find the White Ape and they are attacked by a lion. Lyle knocks himself out trying to flee while Ursula is saved by George. George takes Ursula to his treehouse home and cares for her, introducing her to Shep, an African bush elephant that acts like George's dog, and Tookie, a toco toucan. George is smitten with Ursula and attempts to woo her; Ursula reciprocates his attraction, and her time spent with George makes her no longer wish to return home. Lyle, Max and Thor find the treehouse and Lyle confronts Ursula and George. Max and Thor make to shoot Shep for his ivory, and Ape shouts at Shep to run. Everyone is stunned by the sight of a talking ape and Max and Thor decide to tranquilize and capture him.

Answer:","completion":"William III of England, also known as William of Orange, was born on November 4, 1650, in the Binnenhof, The Hague, Netherlands. A key figure in the Protestant Reformation, he followed the Calvinist religion. William III ascended to the throne as the King of England, Scotland, and Ireland on February 13, 1689, following the Glorious Revolution, which saw the overthrow of King James II (his father-in-law and uncle), known for his Catholic ideology. William's reign marked a significant turning point in British history, as it limited the power of the monarchy in favor of a parliamentary system, affirming the principle of the constitutional monarchy. During his reign, William III fought against Louis XIV of France, forging a series of alliances with other European countries in an effort to maintain a balance of power and curb French expansion. He achieved this through multiple conflicts, such as the Nine Years' War (1688-1697) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714). Despite facing several challenges, including Jacobite rebellions and conflicts with Parliament, William III made notable contributions to British politics. He played a pivotal role in establishing the Bank of England, reforming the nation's finance system, and passing multiple Acts of Parliament that enshrined civil liberties and religious toleration. William III's portrait was immortalized by the celebrated painter Sir Godfrey Kneller. The famous signature \\"WilliamIII Sig.svg\\" is attributed to the monarch as well. On March 8, 1702, William III died at Kensington Palace in London. His death marked the end of his reign and, since he had no direct heir, led to the ascension of his sister-in-law, Queen Anne, to the throne. William III's legacy remains prominent in British history, as he played an instrumental role in shaping the modern concept of constitutional monarchy and ensuring the continued dominance of Protestantism in England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The simplest way to do this is to insert two fingers into the shackle loop and use them to force the shackle away from the top of the lock. This will put the locking pins inside the lock into the right position for a quick crack-job. Make sure you’ve eliminated all excess slack from the shackle. If you don’t, you won’t be able to knock the lock loose, no matter how many times you hit it. Don’t try to grip the body of the lock itself—that’s where you’ll be aiming your hammer. More specifically, you want to target the side that contains the fixed end of the shackle, as the pins are located just underneath. Pound the lock over and over again using quick, short strikes. Eventually, you’ll disengage enough of the pins to “bump” the lock open. You can also use the handle of a screwdriver or another hard, blunt item if you don’t happen to have a hammer handy. The best part about coaxing a padlock open with a hammer is that it should still work like nothing ever happened afterwards, so long as you don’t hit it hard enough to damage any of the pins. As soon as you get done breaking your lock, give it a test run. If it fastens properly, hold onto it for future usage. If not, chuck it in the trash. This method can be useful if you need to remove your padlock without the keys but don’t want to destroy it in the process.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What authority did Neilston remain under until 1975? ? Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire County Council, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of Strathclyde. In 1903, Neilston was within the Paisley Small Debt Court District and Poor Combination. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the Renfrew District of Strathclyde until the two-tier regions and districts of Scotland were abolished. Since 1996 it has formed part of the unitary East Renfrewshire council area; East Renfrewshire Council is the local authority.

Ukraine ceasefire extended for 3 days Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has extended a ceasefire with insurgents in the nation's east for three days. Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavron had earlier said it was hoping for an extension of the truce, but warned that Ukraine must not simply delay an \\"ultimatum\\" for separatists to lay down their arms. \\"We hope that this does not only mean a postponement of the ultimatum for three days,\\" Lavrov was quoted by Interfax news agency as telling reporters in Moscow after Itar-Tass news agency reported that Kyiv had decided to extend the ceasefire. In an interview with the Guardian and four other European newspapers, Poroshenko said Ukrainian soldiers have been targeted in more than 150 attacks since the ceasefire began and that five soldiers have been killed on Friday alone. Poroshenko said Russia has done \\"nothing\\" to end the \\"distastrous\\" war. On Thursday, he said he might not extend the truce if it appeared that rebel groups were using the break in fighting to rearm. When he announced the ceasefire on June 20, he offered rebels amnesty if they lay down their weapons. Pro-Russian separatist leaders and mediators for the Kyiv government met in the city of Donetsk on Friday in new consultations on ending the fighting in Ukraine's Russian-speaking east, a spokeswoman for the rebels said. Interfax news agency said the rebels were talking to the so-called \\"contact group\\" which includes former President Leonid Kuchma, Moscow's ambassador to Kyiv and representatives of the OSCE rights and security watchdog. A first round of talks was held last Monday and ended with a rebel commitment to honour the ceasefire. But the Kyiv government says the rebels have carried out numerous breaches of the ceasefire over the past week, including the downing of a military helicopter on Tuesday killing nine service personnel. In a separate development, Poroshenko on Friday signed a trade and economic pact with the European Union, saying it may be the \\"most important day\\" for his country since it became independent from the Soviet Union. It was the decision of his pro-Moscow predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych, to back out of the same EU association agreement in November that touched off massive protests in Ukraine that eventually led to Yanukovych's flight abroad, Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Pro-Russian separatists remain heavily armed in Ukraine's Donetsk region. (Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters) Later Friday, EU heads of state and government were expected to consider whether to ramp up sanctions against Russia over its conduct toward Ukraine. Before the signing ceremony, Poroshenko brandished a commemorative pen inscribed with the date of EU's Vilnius summit where Yanukovych balked at approving the agreement. \\"Historic events are unavoidable,\\" he said. At Friday's proceedings, the European Union signed similar association agreements with two other former Soviet republics, Moldova and Georgia. Businesses in the three countries whose goods and practices meet EU standards will be able to trade freely in any of the EU's 28 member nations without tariffs or restrictions. Likewise, EU goods and services will be able to sell more easily and cheaply to businesses and consumers in Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. \\"It's absolutely a new perspective for my country,\\" Poroshenko said. \\"There is nothing in these agreements or in the European Union's approach that might harm Russia in any way,\\" insisted EU President Herman Van Rompuy. But almost immediately, Moscow made clear it was reserving the right to react. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, told Russian news agencies that the Kremlin would respond to the EU-Ukraine accord \\"as soon as negative consequences arise for the economy.\\" But Peskov dismissed the threat of immediate action against Poroshenko's government. \\"In order for those (consequences) to arise, the signed agreement needs to be implemented,\\" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously imposed trade embargoes against its neighbours in response to political or economic moves that the Kremlin views as unfavourable. (Bernadett Szabo/Reuters) Russia has previously imposed trade embargoes against its neighbours in response to political or economic moves that the Kremlin views as unfavourable. European Commission experts estimate implementation of the deal is expected to boost Ukraine's national income by around 1.6 billion US a year. EU Enlargement Commission Stefan Fule said the trade bloc has made clear to Moscow its willingness to demonstrate that Russian economic interests will not be harmed. Perhaps more important than the trade clauses is an accompanying 10-year plan for Ukraine to adopt EU product regulations. Such rules ease the way for international trade beyond Europe. The deal also demands that Ukraine change the way it does business. Adopting EU rules on government contracts, competition policy and the copyright for ideas and inventions should improve the economy by making it more investor-friendly and reducing corruption. Reminding EU leaders of the Ukrainians who died opposing Yanukovych's government and in the ongoing battle against the pro-Russian insurgency in the country's east, Poroshenko said Ukraine \\"paid the highest possible price to make her Europe dreams come true.\\" He asked EU leaders to take a further step, and formally pledge that one day Ukraine will be able to join the EU as a full-fledged member. That \\"would cost the European Union nothing, but would mean the world to my country,\\" he said. Meanwhile, Putin called Friday for a long-term ceasefire in Ukraine to allow talks between representatives of Kyiv and eastern regions where rebels are waging an armed insurgency. Poroshenko has warned a ceasefire now in place may not be extended beyond Friday night when it is due to expire if peace talks with pro-Russian separatists fail to yield a favourable outcome. \\"Most important is the securing of a long-term ceasefire as a necessary condition for substantive talks between the authorities in Kyiv and representatives of the southeastern regions,\\" Putin said. \\"We sincerely strive to help the peace process,\\" he told delegates at a diplomatic ceremony in the Kremlin. Western governments have piled pressure on Putin to take steps to disarm the rebels who Kyiv accuses of numerous breaches of the truce aimed at giving the two sides time to find a political solution to the crisis. Putin also said that the violence in Ukraine had forced tens of thousands of Ukrainians to seek refuge abroad, including in Russia.

Ford anticipates demand for 3-cylinder cars Ford Fiesta, left, with the Ford Focus 1.0-liter EcoBoost model. (Ford) The Ford Focus 1.0-liter EcoBoost sets records over two days at CERAM test circuit in France. (Ford) Dan Carney of Motor Matters discusses Ford’s 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost engine: Government fuel economy requirements are driving renewed consideration of three-cylinder engines by carmakers. Improved technology will make them more acceptable to consumers. We’ve seen relatively few cars with three-cylinder engines. The 1990 Suzuki Swift 1.0-liter 49-horsepower minicar was one. Based on current EPA fuel economy standards, the Swift would be rated today at 38 miles per gallon in the city and 45 mpg on the highway. The 1988 Subaru Justy with its 66-horsepower, 1.2-liter engine was another three-cylinder engine. The all-wheel-drive model would score 26 mpg city and 32 mpg highway today. There wasn’t much other than fuel economy to recommend these cars. They were cramped, slow, noisy, rough-riding and incredibly unsafe in a crash. To succeed, such cars must offer competitive power and performance in a package meeting modern expectations for safety and comfort. Safety and comfort add weight, which dings both fuel efficiency and performance. Efficiency and performance can normally be traded one for the other so it’s tough to have both, yet customers demand performance. Turbocharging is increasingly a part of the answer — and it is the foundation of Ford’s EcoBoost technology. We’ve seen convincing demonstrations of the muscle and economy of EcoBoost in brawny vehicles like the F-150 and Explorer, so we know that smaller-displacement engines can replace bigger ones while delivering fuel economy. So when Ford introduced the tiny 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost engine, I was hopeful that it might actually deliver acceptable performance to go with its superlative efficiency. To underscore this point, Ford attempted to establish new world speed records for the 1.0-liter engine category, with a record run at the CERAM test track north of Paris. The test car was a 125-horsepower Focus EcoBoost 1.0, a configuration already for sale in Europe. Here in the U.S., the smaller Fiesta is a good bet to be the first American model to carry the little EcoBoost engine. By setting the record with the bigger, heavier, roomier and more comfortable Focus rather than the Fiesta, Ford underscored the point that the three-cylinder engine can propel a larger, more comfortable car at record speed. While turbocharging is increasingly common and most drivers are getting comfortable with the idea that using speeding exhaust gas to spin a turbine that compresses air coming into the engine, Ford decided the test would not only be one of speed, but also one of endurance. Ford aimed to set speed records — and they invited me to help with the driving. On May 23 and 24, the gathered group of automotive journalists and Ford employees hammered Focus EcoBoost 1.0-liter test cars around the high-banked CERAM oval for 24 straight hours. In the end the Ford team tentatively set 24 new world speed records (pending official certification). Drivers saw lap speeds as high as 122 mph, the cars averaged 119 mph around the oval for an hour and the average speed for the full 24 hours, including pit stops for driver changes and refueling was 107 mph. This from a car that is rated at 56 mpg in Europe. Once it was clear the cars were taking the pounding just fine, we got the green light to drive flat-out for the last three hours of the run. Gas pedal on the floor, leg cramping to hold it down, for 60 straight minutes each, for three consecutive drivers. For the amazing test cars, it was no fuss, no muss, with no smoke, smells or other typical signs of strain. The temperature gauge never reached the halfway mark. There was a time when turbos were respected for their performance boost, but suspected for their reliability compromises. No more. Modern computer-aided engineering helps prevent hardware inadequacies. Modern computers keep an eye on the software side, ensure the engine never gets outside acceptable conditions, and modern ideas of durability demand extras like a supplemental water cooler for the turbo bearing to ensure it never gets too hot.

Passage: After the defeat at Marignano, the League no longer possessed the ability or the will to continue the war. Francis advanced on Milan, capturing the city on 4 October and removing Sforza from the throne. In December, he met with Leo at Bologna; the pope, who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his Swiss mercenaries, surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Francis and Modena to the Duke of Ferrara. In return, Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the Duchy of Urbino. Finally, the Treaty of Noyon, signed by Francis and Charles V in August 1516, recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples, removing Spain from the war. Maximilian held out, making another attempt to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into negotiations with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy , effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the Italian War of 1521-26. The Italian Wars, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption. Question: What year was Sforza removed from the throne?

Creating a robust and comprehensive portfolio requires taking into account an individual's unique resources and circumstances. Here's a detailed breakdown of how one can make an advertising portfolio, taking into consideration available resources: 1.

You can organize your portfolio chronologically, by project type, or by the specific skills utilized in each project. Choose an organization style that best suits your work and resources available to you. 4.

Utilize platforms like Behance, Wix, or WordPress to create an online presence for your work. Ensure that your digital portfolio is easily accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing on different devices and screen sizes. 7. Keep it updated: As you continue to create new work and improve existing projects, make sure to keep your portfolio updated with your latest accomplishments. This highlights your commitment to growth and continuous learning in the advertising field. 8.

Answer the following question: Title: Game won't start Review: Bought the game, installed it. After 1 day it stopped working. EA support unable to resolve the issue. Thousands of people experiencing same issue, DRM sux !! Aparently the cracked .exe fixes this issue ... DO NOT BUY UNTILL THEY RELEASE A PATCH & REMOVE DRM !! Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is indeed negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects of the game, the support, and the company policies. To fully unpack the negativity in this review, we need to understand each issue raised by the reviewer. First, the reviewer reports that the game stopped working one day after purchase and installation. This is a significant operational issue that would frustrate any user. A game's primary function is to provide entertainment, and its inability to perform this function characterizes it as fundamentally flawed in the eyes of the consumer. Next, the reviewer complains about the inability of Electronic Arts (EA) support to resolve the issue. The reviewer's expectations of after-sale services were not met, which adds to the negativity of the review. Customer service is an integral part of the overall customer experience. Unresolved issues can lead to customer disenchantment and negative reviews. The reviewer also states that thousands of people are experiencing the same issue, suggesting a widespread problem. The comment implies that the issue is not with the reviewer's individual game or system but with the game as released by the company. Knowing that others are experiencing the same difficulties validates the reviewer's complaint and compounds the negativity of the review. A critical issue in this review is the mention of DRM (Digital Rights Management). The reviewer believes this to be the cause of the problem. DRM is a class of technologies used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, and copyright holders to control the use of digital content after the sale. Some users find DRM restrictive and detrimental to the gaming experience. In this case, the reviewer not only dislikes the DRM but holds it responsible for the game's malfunctioning, making this a significant negative point in the review. Lastly, the reviewer mentions a sort of workaround to the issue implying the use of an illegal solution (cracked .exe file). This reflects poorly on the company as it implies that some players must resort to unauthorized methods to use the game they legally purchased. The reviewer concludes with a strong negative recommendation: \\"DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY RELEASE A PATCH & REMOVE DRM\\". This statement tells potential buyers to avoid purchasing the product until fundamental changes are made, reinforcing the overall negative sentiment of the review. In summary, this review is undoubtedly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and dissatisfaction towards the game, the company's support team, and policies on DRM. The reviewer's recommendation to other potential buyers to avoid the product further strengthens the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

USA TODAY Catcher Steve Clevenger is a journeyman with six years in the majors. (Photo: Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports) The Seattle Mariners suspended Steve Clevenger without pay for the remainder of the season, moving swiftly Friday to discipline their backup catcher after his set of tweets imploring that protestors in Charlotte should be “locked behind bars like animals.” Clevenger, 30, who has played in just 22 games this season, issued an apology Thursday night for his tweets referring to protests in North Carolina following the fatal police shooting of an African American. He will not appeal his suspension, according to a person with direct knowledge of the issue. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on condition of anonymity because the matter is ongoing. Clevenger’s tweets read: “Black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black officer haha (expletive) cracks me up! Keep kneeling for the anthem! “BLM (Black Lives Matter) is pathetic again! Obama you are pathetic once again! Everyone should be locked behind bars like animals!” The Mariners issued a statement Thursday condemning the tweets, with general manager Jerry Dipoto noting the club is “examining all internal options available to us.” Twitter | @jonhumbert Jon Humbert on Twitter Clevenger was making a non-guaranteed 517,000 this season; his suspension will cost him around 32,000. A lifetime .227 hitter in 170 games over six seasons, Clevenger batted .221 with one home run this season. He's best known for being included in trades that sent eventual ace Jake Arrieta from the Baltimore Orioles to the Chicago Cubs, and slugger Mark Trumbo from the Mariners the Orioles this past off-season. Demonstrators in Charlotte have been protesting the death of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was shot and killed by police. Two officers and nine civilians were injured and 44 people arrested on Wednesday in several hours of violence that broke out following peaceful protests, prompting Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency. Clevenger's apology Thursday focused on the \\"distraction\\" he caused teammates and was \\"sickened by the idea that anyone would think of me in racist terms.\\" \\"I grew up on the streets of Baltimore, a city I love to this very day,\\" Clevenger said in a statement first released to Fox Sports. \\"I grew up in a very culturally diverse area of America and I am very proud to come from there. I am also proud that my inner circle of friends has never been defined by race but by the content of their character. Any former teammate or anyone who has met me can attest to this and I pride myself on not being a judgemental person. I just ask that the public not judge me because of an ill worded tweet. \\"I do believe that supporting our First Amendment rights and supporting local law enforcement are not mutually exclusive. With everything going on in the world I really just want what is best for everyone regardless of who they are. I like many Americans are frustrated by a lot of things in the world and I would like to be a part of the dialogue moving forward to make this a better world for everyone. I once again apologize to anyone who was offended today and I just ask you not judge me off of a social media posting. Thank you and God bless everyone.\\" Clevenger attended Mt. St. Joseph's High School, a Catholic college preparatory school in Baltimore that also produced All-Star first baseman Mark Teixeira. Contributing: Bob Nightengale GALLERY: NOTABLE MLB SUSPENSIONS ||||| Thursday, Mariners backup catcher Steve Clevenger made some inflammatory comments on Twitter (the NSFW screen-grabs are here and here). The team immediately released a statement saying that it strongly disagrees with the \\"language and tone\\" of Clevenger's comments. Friday, the club took further action: The #Mariners have announced that catcher Steve Clevenger has been suspended without pay for the remainder of the season. — MarinersPR (@MarinersPR) September 23, 2016 Per Major League Baseball's social media policy, that was implemented in 2012, players are prohibited from putting forth social media content that is \\"derogatory or insensitive to individuals based on race, color, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or religion, including, but not limited to, slurs, jokes, stereotypes or other inappropriate remarks.\\" Clevenger, 30, is a career .227/.284/.324 hitter and has been below average at throwing out would-be basestealers. He's only appeared in 22 games this season. Given his lackluster career numbers, these comments are probably career-threatening. ||||| The other shoe has dropped in the Steve Clevenger saga: The Seattle Mariners have suspended the injured catcher for the rest of the season because of racially-charged tweets about the Charlotte protests, the Black Lives Matter movement and President Obama. General manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement: Scroll to continue with content Ad “As soon as we became aware of the tweets posted by Steve yesterday we began to examine all of our options in regard to his standing on the team. Today we have informed him that he is suspended for the remainder of the season without pay.” Clevenger was already on the 60-day disabled list and wasn’t going to play this season anyway. This isn’t about playing time, rather they’re punishing him in his wallet. He’ll now forfeit the remainder of his 516,500 salary for this season. That comes out to about 31,900 for the final 10 games. The Mariners suspended catcher Steve Clevenger for his tweets about the Charlotte protests. (Getty Images) The tweets that started all this came Thursday afternoon in response to the protests in Charlotte that had turned violent the night before. Protestors were upset about the death of Keith Lamont Scott, a 43-year-old African-American man, who was shot and killed by police Tuesday. When the protests turned violent, one person was shot (and later died), 16 police officers were injured and multiple police vehicles were damaged. Here are screenshots of his Clevenger’s tweets taken before he made his Twitter account private. The most incendiary part was Clevenger saying “everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals.” Story continues Rational person: \\"That Mark Trumbo-for-Steve Clevenger trade this offseason cannot possibly get any worse.\\" Steve Clevenger: \\"Wanna bet?\\" pic.twitter.com/AtVMYQE9Rk — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) September 23, 2016 Clevenger issued a statement on Thursday night, apologizing for the incident and maintaining that he’s not a racist. His statement read: “First and foremost I would like to apologize to the Seattle Mariners, my teammates, my family and the fans of our great game for the distraction my tweets on my personal twitter page caused when they went public earlier today. I am sickened by the idea that anyone would think of me in racist terms. My tweets were reactionary to the events I saw on the news and were worded beyond poorly at best and I can see how and why someone could read into my tweets far more deeply than how I actually feel. “I grew up on the streets of Baltimore, a city I love to this very day. I grew up in a very culturally diverse area of America and I am very proud to come from there. I am also proud that my inner circle of friends has never been defined by race but by the content of their character.

Thank you and God bless everyone.” The bigger questions now are about Clevenger’s future. He’s a 30-year-old backup catcher who hasn’t played more than 69 games in any season of his six-year MLB career. He’s a career .227 hitter with four homers. The Mariners have him under team control until 2020. He’s arbitration eligible in 2017. Will the Mariners cut him loose in the offseason? If so, would another team sign him?

This situation likely caught the narrator off guard, causing them to experience emotional and psychological shock, leaving them feeling confused, overwhelmed, and unsure of how to respond in that moment. There can be multiple factors contributing to the narrator's reaction, and it's essential to consider the different possibilities to understand the full context: 1. Personal boundaries: The kiss might have crossed the narrator's personal boundaries, making them feel uncomfortable and unable to react immediately. The sudden closeness and physical contact may have been unwelcome and unexpected, taking them by surprise. 2. Relationship dynamics: The nature of the relationship between the narrator and the person who kissed them is unclear. If they are just friends or colleagues, such an intimate moment might have seemed inappropriate or confusing to the narrator, causing them to freeze up. 3. Social expectations: The narrator might have been uncertain about how to react to the situation based on social norms and expectations. They may not have wanted to hurt the other person's feelings, even if the kiss was unwanted, leading to indecision that caused them to freeze. 4. Emotional state: The narrator's emotional state at the time of the kiss could have influenced their reaction. If they were already feeling stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed, the sudden change in events might have simply been too much to process simultaneously, causing them to freeze. 5. Past experiences: The narrator's personal history could have played a role in their response. If they had experienced any past traumas or negative experiences involving physical touch or intimacy, they might be more prone to freezing up in such situations out of fear, confusion, or discomfort. In conclusion, the narrator's sudden freezing up after being kissed on the mouth can be attributed to a combination of surprise, personal boundaries, relationship dynamics, social expectations, emotional state, and past experiences. Their inability to react immediately showcased a complex interplay of emotions, expectations, and thought processes that might have left them feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to respond appropriately at that moment."},{"prompt":"In this task, you're given an ambiguous question (which can be answered in more than one way).

(Associated Press) Mitch Seavey and 10 dogs crossed the Nome finish line to cheering crowds at 10:39 p.m. Alaska time Tuesday. \\"This is for all of the gentlemen of a certain age,\\" he said on a live stream posted to the Iditarod website after completing the race in temperatures just above zero. His race time in the 1,000-mile race was nine days, 7 hours and 39 minutes. Seavey's victory came after a dueling sprint against Aliy Zirkle, last year's runner-up, along the frozen, wind-whipped Bering Sea coast. Zirkle crossed the finish line 24 minutes after her rival, who greeted her after a while. \\"You did a good job,\\" Seavey told Zirkle as a camera crew filmed them. \\"You're going to win this thing, probably more than once.\\" At a news conference after the race Zirkle gave credit to her rival's strategy. \\"Mitch has this ability to sit on the sidelines and refuel because he knows he needs to refuel, while everyone else is zooming by,\\" she said. \\"It's smart, and that's probably why you won.\\" Immediately after finishing, both mushers rushed to pet their dogs, with Seavey singling out his main leader, 6-year-old Tanner, posing for photos with the dog and another leader, Taurus, wearing yellow garlands. Zirkle's dogs wagged their tails as she praised them. \\"My dog team is my heart,\\" she said. The pair jostled for the lead, with Zirkle never more than a few miles behind, in the final stretch. \\"I just now stopped looking over my shoulder,\\" Seavey said after winning. Also trailing by a dozen or so miles was four-time champion Jeff King, who was followed by a cluster of contenders, including Seavey's son, Dallas Seavey. The younger Seavey at age 25 last year became the youngest Iditarod winner ever, beating Zirkle to the finish line by one hour. Mitch Seavey first won the Iditarod in 2004. Before his Tuesday night win, King had been the oldest Iditarod champion, winning his fourth race at age 50 in 2006. The oldies were still stellar performers in a race that ended last year with a top field featuring many finishers in their 20s and 30, noted Iditarod race spokeswoman Erin McLarnon. \\"Last year, we saw a lot of those youngsters in the top 10,\\" McLarnon said. \\"Some of those 45-plussers are taking back the lead this year. They are showing the young 'uns what they can really do out there on that trail.\\" Zirkle, 43, had hoped to be only the third woman to win the race and the first since Susan Butcher won her fourth Iditarod in 1990. Before this year's race, Zirkle noted the long time that had passed since a woman won. \\"This is my 13th year, and I've wanted to win every year,\\" she said before the race, which began March 2 with 66 teams at a ceremonial start in Anchorage. The competitive part of the race began the following day in Willow 50 miles to the north. Since then, the race changed leaders several times. Those at the front of the field included four-time champions Lance Mackey and Martin Buser, who later fell behind. En route to Nome, the race turned into an aggressively contested run among veterans along an often punishing trail. Conditions on the Yukon River required dogs to go through deep snow and navigate glare ice. Above-freezing temperatures also led to overflow along the trail, a potentially dangerous situation where water has pushed up through the ice and refrozen, creating a weak top layer of ice that teams and mushers can break through. For reaching Nome first, Seavey wins 50,400 and a new 2013 Dodge Ram pickup truck. The rest of the 600,000 purse will be split among the next 29 mushers to cross the finish line under the famed burled arch on Front Street, a block from the sea. ___ Associated Press writer Rachel D'Oro reported from Anchorage. Follow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/rdoro. ___ Online: http://iditarod.com ||||| NOME — Mitch Seavey scored one for the AARP-eligible crowd Tuesday night by becoming the oldest champion in Iditarod history. Seavey, 53, outdueled Aliy Zirkle on the final stretch of the 1,000-mile race. “This is for all the gentlemen of a certain age who think it ends at 50, ’cause it doesn’t,” Seavey said after crossing under the burled arch with a team of 10 dogs. The Sterling musher steadily pulled away from Zirkle on the 67-mile run from White Mountain, where just 13 minutes separated the two mushers in the afternoon. Led by Tanner, a 6-year-old, orange-brown husky who is a kennel favorite, Seavey coasted down Nome’s Front Street at 10:39 p.m. “I gotta go congratulate my lead dog Tanner,” Seavey said after his team came to a stop. “He’s probably the best I’ve ever had. “Tanner is happy to be a sled dog and he makes it look easy.” Seavey’s winning margin of 23 minutes, 39 seconds made it the fourth-closest race in Iditarod history. Seavey finished in 9 days, 7 hours, 39 minutes, 56 seconds. Zirkle finished in 9 days, 8 hours, 3 minutes, 35 seconds. “I was going for it,” Zirkle said, “but that slippery little sucker, I couldn’t catch him.” As she traveled from White Mountain to Nome, Zirkle watched Seavey’s winding tracks in the snow. She tried to guess if the musher was speeding up or slowing down based on whether the tracks stayed smack in the middle of the trail or drifted to the side. “And you don’t know,” she said. “But it’s kind of fun to guess.” “And then for about 30 miles of the trail we’re high above treeline in these rolling mountains, and every time I would come up over the hill I would see him coming back down the other side,” Zirkle said. Zirkle, 43, said she thought she saw Seavey’s yellow sled after Safety, but it was just a hallucination. Meantime, Seavey was imagining he was seeing Zirkle all across the tundra. “I saw the raven Aliy, I saw the fuel tank Aliy. And the upside-down boat Aliy,” Seavey said. “Everything I was seeing back there I thought must be her … I would continue to scare myself that she was catching up to me.” Zirkle’s time is the second fastest by a woman. Her time last year — 9 days, 5 hours, 29 minutes, 10 seconds — is the fastest. “You’re gonna win this thing,” Seavey told the Two Rivers musher as he shook her hand. OLDEST WINNER Seavey replaced Jeff King as the Iditarod’s oldest champion. King, who was poised early Wednesday morning to claim third place, was 50 when he won his fourth victory in 2006. Mitch’s son Dallas was 25 when he won last year’s race, giving the Seaveys the oldest and youngest champs in race history. Both of those distinctions came at Zirkle’s expense. Dallas beat her by 59 minutes, 44 seconds last year. Tuesday’s victory was the second for Mitch — he won his first in 2004 — and marked his 19th finish in 20 attempts. “I hate to go off into the sunset knowing I only did it once in 20 tries,” he said, “so it’s sorta a validation.” The finish was the 12th for Zirkle, who was hoping to drive her team to its second thousand-mile championship of the year. Nine of the 10 dogs she finished with — Quito, Olivia, Scruggs, Scout, Beemer, Nacho, Chica, Biscuit and Willie — helped Zirkle’s husband, Allen Moore, win the Yukon Quest last month in Fairbanks. “My dog team is my heart,” Zirkle said. “They’re my family and they’re fantastic.” Seavey will collect 50,400 and a new pickup truck for his victory. Zirkle gets 47,100 for second place. PATIENCE PAYS OFF Seavey had to ward off both King and Zirkle in the last one-third of the race. Patience paid off for him on Monday, when he resisted the urge to follow when King blew through Koyuk to temporarily claim the lead. Seavey stayed at the checkpoint for another three hours and was able to overtake King on the run to Elim. He owned a 48-minute lead leaving Elim on Monday night, but Zirkle came on strong during the overnight run to White Mountain and sliced 35 minutes off his lead. Seavey did himself no favors on that run — he twice fell asleep and fell off his sled, according a Facebook post by his son Danny Seavey. 'RUN MY TUSH OFF' Normally the 67 miles from White Mountain to Nome is a formality. If you get to White Mountain with a comfortable lead, your only job is to avoid screw-ups during the roughly 10-hour trek to the finish. Zirkle’s plan? “Run my tush off,” she said early Tuesday as the leaders rested in White Mountain. Zirkle was trying to become the third woman to win the race and the first since Susan Butcher’s final championship in 1990. Her sled dogs are a small, pixie-like team that descended from a favorite leader named Cha-Cha, are led by pink-nosed veteran Quito. (That’s short for Poquita, smallest of her litter of Spanish-named puppies.) Though Zirkle trailed by a scant 13 minutes at White Mountain, King noted that even a lead of a few minutes there can hand the frontrunner the advantage over the final run west across rolling hills to the coast. “You can get out of sight and the second team doesn’t have the advantage of drafting off you visually,” said King, who said he led DeeDee Jonrowe by about seven minutes out of White Mountain en route to his 1993 title, which he won by more than 30 minutes. Nome musher Aaron Burmeister like how Zirkle’s team looked in White Mountain. “Aliy’s team’s coming together really nicely for her. And they’re really coming on strong here late in the race,” he said. “Mitch has been racing up with me at the front of the pack for a good portion of the race, back and forth. I know his team is pretty tuckered, about like mine right now. His are tuckered because they’ve been raced hard.” But Jonrowe and King said they watched Seavey’s team along the trail and saw formidable dogs. “I saw (the team) going into Grayling, on the Yukon a lot. Just powered through that wet, nasty, sludgy stuff,” Jonrowe said. EARLY CONTENDERS FADE While former champion Martin Buser of Big Lake led at many of the early checkpoints thanks to an unheard of 20-hour run to start the race, it was after his team came off the Yukon River that Seavey staked his move. By Elim, what had looked like a Seavey-King duel became a Seavey-Zirkle duel. Zirkle rested her dogs for about an hour less than Seavey, cutting Seavey’s lead to 48 minutes. Zirkle got even closer on the run to White Mountain. Her headlamp alerted Seavey that she was closing in. “I knew she was coming. I saw her light after I left Elim, when we got to the mountains,” Seavey said. “Typically my team does well in the mountains and I didn’t see her anymore until we got here on Golovin Bay.” The clang of church bells announced Seavey’s arrival to White Mountain at 5:11 a.m. Tuesday. The musher was still unpacking at 5:24 a.m. when Zirkle slid to a stop, bouncing on her sled. “Mitch is up for a race, aren’t ya?” Zirkle said to reporters — and a nearby Seavey — as she finished feeding her dogs. “You calling me out?” Seavey said, heating water a few yards away. He was going to get his sneakers out for the finish, he joked. “Can I borrow your sneakers? My boots are still wet and nasty from the rain,” Zirkle replied. OUT OF WHITE MOUNTAIN Hours later, snowmachines zoomed to the frozen Fish River as volunteers counted down to Seavey’s departure for Nome. Already, 11 teams were parked a few hundred yards from ski planes roaring for takeoff. Dallas and Mitch Seavey hunkered at the elder Seavey’s team. “I don’t think I’m going to be catching up with you guys by any stretch of imagination. But I don’t think you’ll have to wait too long,” Dallas said of his ETA in Nome. Under clear skies, Mitch resumed his race. “Tanner! Gee! Line up!” he commanded his team of 10 dogs before driving off at 1:11 p.m. Zirkle made last-minute inspections before following 13 minutes later. She walked down her line of dogs, rubbing their faces and checking collars. Once Zirkle was on the sled runners, she called to Quito, who began a whistling howl. The musher and the rest of the team joined the chorus, then gave chase. SAFE LEAD BY SAFETY Late Tuesday, the pair was crossing the Bering Sea shore where coastal wind rakes the snow and Seavey and Tanner could be seen marching west toward Nome. Quiot and Zirkle, kicking from the sled, followed about two miles down the trail. By the time Seavey reached Safety, 49 miles from White Mountain and 18 miles from Nome according to the race’s GPS tracker, his lead had stretched to 25 minutes. A race that looked too close to call just a few hours earlier belonged to him. Kyle Hopkins reported from Nome and Beth Bragg from Anchorage. Mitch Seavey and Aily Zirkle at Iditarod Finish Line ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In 2013, Mitch Seavey, at the age of 53, became the oldest person to win the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a challenging endurance test in Alaska. This marked Seavey's second victory in the event, having first won in 2004. His winning time for the 1,000-mile race was nine days, 7 hours, and 39 minutes. Seavey's final race against Aliy Zirkle was intense. Zirkle had been last year's runner-up and, in this race, finished second to Seavey by a margin of 24 minutes. After the race, Seavey praised Zirkle's performance and predicted future victories for her. Seavey's win also symbolizes a victory for older competitors in the field. Erin McLarnon, an Iditarod race spokeswoman, noted a significant performance from the older participants in this year's event after younger competitors dominated the previous year's race. This win made Seavey and his son, Dallas Seavey, the oldest and the youngest champions in the history of the race. Dallas won the Iditarod at the age of 25 the previous year. Mitch Seavey's victory garnered him a prize of 50,400 and a new 2013 Dodge Ram pickup truck."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How to teach a dog to crawl Get some treats ready. A major part of training your dog is rewarding good behavior with a treat. This sends a positive message to your dog that a certain behavior was the right thing to do and that he should want to do it again in the future.","completion":"Step 1: Choose a quiet location with minimal distractions. In order for your dog to focus on learning the \\"crawl\\" command, you would want to choose a quiet, comfortable spot without any distractions, such as other animals or people walking by. This will ensure that both you and your dog can focus on the task at hand. Step 2: Get your dog in a \\"down\\" position. Start by getting your dog into a \\"down\\" position. To do this, give the \\"down\\" command and reward your dog with a treat when they lie down. If your dog doesn't know the \\"down\\" command yet, you can gently pat the ground while holding a treat close to the floor to encourage your dog to lie down. Reward with a treat once they're in the correct position. Step 3: Introduce the \\"crawl\\" command. Hold a treat in your hand close to your dog's nose, but not close enough for him to reach it easily. Give the command \\"crawl\\" while slowly moving the treat away from your dog's nose. The goal is to encourage your dog to crawl forward while staying in the \\"down\\" position. Step 4: Reward progress and gradually increase difficulty. Whenever your dog moves forward in the \\"crawl\\" position, reward him with a treat and verbal praise. Repeat the process several times, gradually increasing the distance your dog must crawl to get the treat. Each time your dog makes progress, remember to reward and praise. Step 5: Practice and reinforcement. Practice the \\"crawl\\" command with your dog daily, ensuring you always reward for progress and success. As your dog becomes more comfortable with the command, you can gradually reduce the frequency of treats and only use verbal praise for reinforcement. Step 6: Introduce distractions to strengthen the skill. Once your dog has mastered the \\"crawl\\" command in a quiet setting, you can slowly introduce distractions such as other animals, people, or noisy environments. This will help your dog become a truly dependable crawler, even in challenging situations! Remember to continue reinforcing good behavior with treats and praise during this process. By following these steps, you'll be able to teach your dog to crawl successfully while simultaneously building a strong bond and fostering a positive learning environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", as well as \\"sweet [and] slightly alien\\".

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Andoheb, the aging High Priest of Arkam (Karnak in the previous films), has summoned Yousef Bey to the Temple of Arkam to pass on the duties of High Priest. Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousefâs mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint.

Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea. But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

As a specialist opening batsman, Sutcliffe's rivals on the field were the opposing bowlers and especially fast bowlers, though he encountered many outstanding spin bowlers too on turning or sticky wickets. By the time Sutcliffe began his Test career, the formidable fast bowling partnership of Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald had ended, though Sutcliffe faced Gregory in Test matches and was opposed to McDonald in \\"Roses matches\\" between Yorkshire and Lancashire. Gregory by 1924-25 was no longer able to \\"frighten batsmen with sheer speed\\" but he still commanded respect and Jack Hobbs specifically told Sutcliffe to exercise caution against Gregory at the start of an innings. Sutcliffe regarded McDonald as \\"one of the best bowlers I ever met\\". He commented on McDonald's trick of \\"resting\\" by making himself seem tired and then \\"hurling himself into (a very fast delivery) like a demon\\". As Sutcliffe said, he never knew which ball would be the fast one and McDonald was a dangerous opponent. But Sutcliffe was quoted as saying that he had \\"never played finer fast bowling\\" than that of the West Indians Learie Constantine, George Francis, Herman Griffith and Manny Martindale. Among the best English bowlers he faced in county cricket were some of his colleagues in England teams, such as Harold Larwood, Maurice Tate and Tich Freeman. One of the toughest competitors he faced was the Australian leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett, \\"a tiny gnome of a man\\", who bowled with a roundarm action and made his Test debut at the age of 34, taking 11 wickets in his first match. Grimmett bowled \\"like a miser\\" and \\"begrudged every run\\", whereas his leg spin partner Arthur Mailey was the type of bowler who would \\"buy\\" his wickets by conceding runs and then, having boosted the batsman's confidence, snaring him with a \\"wrong 'un\\" (i.e., a googly). On Sutcliffe's first tour of Australia, he commented that he \\"was troubled most of the time by Arthur Mailey\\" but eventually he learned how to \\"differentiate between Mailey's leg breaks and his wrong 'uns\\". Answer this question \\"Why were they noted opponents of him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"They were noted opponents of Sutcliffe because they were formidable and skillful bowlers, possessing different techniques and strategies that challenged and troubled him during matches. For example, Ted McDonald had a trick of seeming tired and then suddenly delivering a very fast ball, making him a dangerous opponent. On the other hand, Sutcliffe faced excellent fast bowling from West Indian players like Learie Constantine, George Francis, Herman Griffith, and Manny Martindale. Additionally, in county cricket, Sutcliffe was challenged by prominent English bowlers such as Harold Larwood, Maurice Tate, and Tich Freeman. The Australian leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett was another tough competitor due to his miserly bowling style, while Arthur Mailey's strategy was to \\"buy\\" wickets by conceding runs and then surprising the batsman with a googly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Question: How did Allan Hills meteorite get its name?

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Scotland is a unique place, loaded with history, where you can find aristocratic palaces and castles, as well as the traditional parades in national costumes. In order to see and discover the true soul of Scotland today and what formed the character of this splendid region, we have to go towards the northern regions, to the Grampian Mountains , beautiful and plain. The Scots conquered the environment with simple spades and strong arms, for it was difficult to farm. The history of this ancient struggle, and its people's ancient love with the hard land, can be felt within the walls of the Angus Folk Museum. You are able to get a feel of the typical rural atmosphere of times past from the everyday artifacts displayed here. From coastal Aberdeen in towards the Grampian Mountains there runs the Castle Trail, a road that touches on many fortresses , which are witnesses of continual fights against the control of neighboring England in Scottish history. Perhaps the most exciting moment for Scottish autonomy is _ experienced inside this ancient church of Arbroath, where, in 1320, the Declaration of Independence was celebrated, at the instigation of King Robert the Bruce. He carried out the plan for autonomy drawn up by the great popular hero William Wallace, for whom cinema has designed the wonderful film Brave Heart, the winner of the five Oscars. This is Glamis Castle, where King Macbeth and Queen Elizabeth used to live. Among the most frequent guests here are the predictable ghosts, if not actually created, by ancient popular beliefs. These have been handed down over the centuries by people tending to live with mystery, with the forces of the supernatural. Another attraction here is a legendary monster: the Loch Ness Monster. Whether it's real or imaginary, this monster, which has been nicknamed Nessie, has collected a good 3,000 sightings over the last 50 years.

A) The signing of the Treaty of Union B) The inauguration of King Robert the Bruce C) The celebration of the Declaration of Independence D) The planning of autonomy by William Wallace The correct answer is C) The celebration of the Declaration of Independence. This event was a significant moment in Scottish history. King Robert the Bruce, having been inspired by the plan for autonomy drawn up by popular hero William Wallace, instigated the celebration at this ancient church. It marked a definitive step towards Scottish autonomy from the control of neighbouring England, evident in many battles represented by the fortresses along the Castle Trail. Scottish history is deeply imprinted on its landscape, from its coastal cities to the Grampian Mountains, and this event is a powerful testament to its people's determination and love for their land."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: An awful realization is setting in for those trapped in the vicinity of the crippled Fukushima nuclear complex: People are afraid to help them.Residents describe spooky scenes of municipal cars driving down near-empty streets telling people to stay indoors, but they've seen few other signs of outside help.Aid agencies are reluctant to get too close to the plant. Shelters set up in the greater Fukushima area for \\"radiation refugees\\" have little food, in part because nobody wants to deliver to an area that might be contaminated. And with little or no gasoline available, not everyone who wants to leave can get out.Radiation fears mingled with a sickening sense of abandonment Wednesday.\\"People who don't have family nearby, who are old or sick in bed, or couldn't get gasoline, they haven't been able to get away from the radiation,\\" said Emi Shinkawa, who feels doubly vulnerable. Her house was swept away by the tsunami Her daughter, Tomoko Monma, knows she's lucky: At 9 a.m. Wednesday, she piled her family into the car, thankful for her husband's foresight in setting aside enough gasoline for them to make their escape.But she's angry that people living outside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the nuclear plant weren't given help finding public transportation or the gasoline to drive away in their own cars. Monma lives 21 miles from the plant.\\"We've gotten no help. We've gotten no information,\\" said Monma, 28, who sat cradling her thumb-sucking 2-year-old daughter on the tatami mats that had been laid out in a sports center in Yamagata, 100 miles inland, which now serves as a shelter for people fleeing Fukushima.\\"The government is demanding that we don't go out, but it isn't bringing us anything,\\" Katsunobu Sakurai, the mayor of a city close to the exclusion zone, complained in an interview with the national NHK television network . \\"Truck drivers don't want to enter the city. They're afraid of being exposed to radiation…. If the government says we're in a dangerous area, it should take more care of us!\\"The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned American citizens Wednesday that they should move at least 50 miles away from the Fukushima plant, which is leaking significant amounts of radioactivity. That warning is significantly stronger than the Japanese government's warning to keep 12 miles away.Foreign aid workers in the area have been assessing the radiation risks, but many chose to remain just outside the 12-mile zone Thursday morning.Casey Calamusa, a communications officer with Federal Way, Wash.-based World Vision who is coordinating the operation in Tokyo , said a three-member team went to Fukushima on Wednesday to distribute supplies such as water, blankets and diapers at an evacuation center. The team was equipped with protective masks and suits and stayed outside the exclusion zone, he said.\\"They were playing it pretty safe. They were talking to local authorities and letting them know we wanted to help the evacuees,\\" Calamusa said. \\"There is an imperative to help those people — they've had to leave their belongings behind and they're staying in shelters in near-freezing weather.\\"Officials at Westport , Conn.-based Save the Children were still trying to decide Wednesday whether to dispatch staff to Fukushima, weighing information from the Japanese government and their member group, Save the Children Japan, said spokesman Lane Hartill. The group already has staff responding in Tokyo and the northern city of Sendai.\\"This is a first for us. We are a humanitarian organization — we don't know this. We're not nuclear physicists. We want to be able to protect our staff and to help people and their children,\\" Hartill said.The Fukushima No. 1 (Daiichi) plant, which opened in 1971, had been a good neighbor in many ways, providing jobs and subsidizing kindergartens, parks and community centers to gain residents' acceptance. Increasingly, those same neighbors are feeling betrayed.Naoki Nanno, 30, who spent two years as a construction worker on the plant's reactors, complained that Tokyo Electric Power Co. , the plant's operator, had been too slow in disclosing the problems that have mounted over the last few days. When one of the explosions occurred Monday, at the No. 3 reactor, Nanno was on the telephone with his brother.\\"I heard a loud bang and I suspected it was an explosion at the nuclear plant, but they didn't announce it for another 20 minutes are so. There was radioactive material leaking after that explosion — we should have known about it right away,\\" said Nanno, who lives 25 miles from the plant. ||||| Workers wearing protective clothing and respirators head towards the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. -- PHOTO: REUTERS ONE lone voice has emerged from the group of heroic workers at Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), which runs the quake-stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, where workers are scrambling to cool the nuclear plant and avoid a meltdown. A female worker at Tepco - has written on her blog, speaking up for her 'silent' colleagues who remained behind at the plant. She had been quoted a little in some overseas English reports but The Straits Times Online tracked and translated her blog to find out her full story when she first posted on popular Japanese social networking site Mixi. By Thursday however, her post had been taken down, but the entry had already been reproduced by several online blogs and in Japanese language forums. She is one of the 800 employees evacuated from the plant on Monday, leaving 50 workers behind to battle the nuclear crisis. On Tuesday, she addressed the growing criticisms levelled at Tepco. 'People have been flaming Tepco,' she said. 'But the staff of Tepco have refused to flee, and continue to work even at the peril of their own lives. Please stop attacking us.' Tepco, which powers Japan's capital and largest city Tokyo, is one of the main players in the world of Japanese nuclear power, with a history of safety violations. Even Prime Minister Naoto Kan, frustrated that an explosion featured in the news had not been reported to the Prime Minister's office, is reported to have burst into an executive meeting at the company and demanded what was going on. However, the plant worker's blog post gives the world a glimpse of the tireless, faceless crew - now dubbed the Fukushima 50 - who are working on the frontline to stop the nuclear crisis from escalating, risking the effects of radiation. In the most severe cases, radiation can lead to higher chances of developing cancer, or even death. 'As a worker at Tepco and a member of the Fukushima No. 2 reactor team, I was dealing with the crisis at the scene until (Monday).' 'In the midst of the tsunami alarm (last Friday), at 3am in the night when we couldn't even see where we going, we carried on working to restore the reactors from where we were, right by the sea, with the realisation that this could be certain death,' she said. 'The machine that cools the reactor is just by the ocean, and it was wrecked by the tsunami. Everyone worked desperately to try and restore it. Fighting fatigue and empty stomachs, we dragged ourselves back to work. 'There are many who haven't gotten in touch with their family members, but are facing the present situation and working hard.' Battling On 'Please remember that. I want this message to reach even just one more person. Everyone at the power plant is battling on, without running away. 'To all the residents (around the plant) who have been alarmed and worried, I am truly, deeply sorry. 'I know I will be abused and hurt because of this. There are people working to protect all of you, even in exchange for their own lives. 'Watching my co-workers putting their lives on the line without a second thought in this situation, I'm proud to be a member of Tepco, and a member of the team behind Fukushima No. 2 reactor. 'I hope to return to the plant and work on the restoration of the reactor.' But her pleas seem to have gone unheard. The original post has now been taken down and she has instead posted an apology: 'I am very sorry, but I have locked the post as it was being used in a way I had not intended it to be. 'Having seen what's happening on the ground, my message to all of you remains the same. But others have changed the contents of the post and used it for the wrong reasons, like fanning fear amongst others, and I have therefore decided to lock my post. 'I am praying from the bottom of my heart for the safety of your loved ones. I am sorry it (the blog post) has turned out this way.'

Which period would be more harmful for habitat of species, time A or time B? Keith was reading a book on climate. He found an interesting table that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two different times, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's climatic condition in the previous century. And, time B showed earth's climatic condition in the present century. Keith was amazed to see how the world has changed in just a century. Hint: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph and hint, it can be concluded that Time B would be more harmful for the habitat of species as compared to Time A. Several points support this conclusion. Firstly, Time B represents the earth's climatic conditions in the present century, which has experienced a significant increase in global warming due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal and oil. These actions release gases into the atmosphere, contributing to the rise in the Earth's average temperature by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F) during the past century. This increase in temperature, although seemingly small, can have detrimental effects on the organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments. Secondly, any climate change, whether long-term or temporary, can be hazardous to the habitat of a species. In the given example, a brief change in the climate, such as an increase in sea temperature, may be too stressful for certain types of fish to reproduce. The loss of reproduction capabilities of a species can ultimately lead to a decline in their population and endanger their survival. Lastly, since Time A refers to the climatic conditions in the previous century, it is reasonable to assume that human-induced factors causing global climate change were comparatively lower than they are in the present time (Time B). The ongoing acceleration of fossil fuel consumption and other human activities contributing to climate change make Time B more harmful to the habitats of species, as the rate of change may be too rapid for them to adapt and survive. In summary, due to the increased human contributions to global warming and the greater rate of climate change in the present century, Time B is more harmful to the habitat of species as compared to Time A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this specific problem, the two phrases are: Head: fishmonger Tail: bone fish To find the answer, think about whether a fishmonger (the Head) is capable of boning a fish (the Tail). This requires thinking about the occupation of a fishmonger, who sells and often prepares fish for sale.

A:","completion":"To answer this elaborate question, we first need to identify the German-American DJ and music producer based in Miami. The person being referred to here is Anton Zaslavski, known professionally as Zedd. Zedd is a Russian-German DJ, record producer, and songwriter who primarily produces and performs electro house music, but has also dabbled in other genres. Although he was born in Russia, he grew up in Germany and later moved to the United States, where he is currently based in Miami, Florida. Now that we have identified the artist, let us delve into his discography to determine his third album. Zedd has officially released two studio albums to date and various singles and remixes. His debut album, \\"Clarity,\\" was released on October 5, 2012, and contains the hit singles \\"Shave It,\\" \\"Spectrum,\\" and the Grammy award-winning title track \\"Clarity.\\" The album received widespread acclaim and helped establish Zedd as a prominent figure in the electronic dance music (EDM) scene. Zedd's second studio album, \\"True Colors,\\" was released on May 15, 2015. The album featured collaborations with various artists, including Selena Gomez, Jon Bellion, and Troye Sivan. The album spawned several chart-topping singles, such as \\"I Want You to Know,\\" \\"Beautiful Now,\\" and \\"Papercut.\\" \\"True Colors\\" received generally positive reviews and further solidified Zedd's status as a leading producer in the EDM landscape. However, at the time of generating this response, Zedd has not yet released his third studio album. He has continued to put out various successful singles and collaborations, such as \\"Stay\\" with Alessia Cara (2017), \\"The Middle\\" with Maren Morris and Grey (2018), and \\"Good Thing\\" with Kehlani (2019). Fans and music enthusiasts anticipate the release of his third album in the future, but until then, a third album does not currently exist in Zedd's discography. Therefore, we cannot provide you with the title of the third album of the German-American DJ and music producer based in Miami, as it has not yet been released. Nonetheless, Zedd remains an important figure in the world of electronic dance music, and his future projects will certainly be met with enthusiasm from his fan base and the music community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service.

On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different.

Analyze the context: Aubrey let herself go after she lost the beauty pageant twice. This implies a negative situation for Aubrey, as she did not win the beauty pageant and let herself go, which might indicate disappointment or change in her attitude towards her performance in the pageant. 2. Check the relevance of the answer option: In this situation, the term \\"talented\\" references an individual's skills or abilities.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.

It is based on Lee Choong-ho's webtoon \\"Dr. Jekyll Is Mr. Hyde\\" (), which gave a romantic comedy spin on the literary character. The series aired on SBS from January 21 to March 26, 2015 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hyde, Jekyll, Me is based on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Hyde, Jekyll, Me is indeed based on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character. However, it is important to note that the South Korean television series takes a unique approach in adapting the character by incorporating a romantic comedy spin to the classic storyline. Adapted from the webtoon by Lee Choong-ho titled \\"Dr. Jekyll Is Mr. Hyde\\", the show presents a fresh and modern take on the well-known literary character created by Robert Louis Stevenson in his 1886 novella, \\"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\". The original novella, set in Victorian London, follows the story of Dr. Henry Jekyll, a respected and successful scientist who struggles to control his darker side, which emerges as a separate, evil personality known as Mr. Edward Hyde. Driven by curiosity and a desire to separate his good and evil selves, Dr. Jekyll conducts experiments on himself, leading to disastrous consequences and ultimately, his tragic demise. In contrast, the South Korean television series, \\"Hyde, Jekyll, Me\\", centers around the life of Koo Seo-Jin (played by Hyun Bin), who has dissociative identity disorder as a result of childhood trauma. He possesses two distinct personalities – a cool and stoic Seo-Jin and the warm-hearted, fun-loving Robin. When a cheerful circus artist named Jang Ha-Na (played by Han Ji-min) enters Seo-Jin's life, she becomes entangled in the complicated dynamics between his two personas, ultimately leading to a love triangle. While the series diverges from the dark and gothic themes of Stevenson's classic novella, it still maintains the core concept of a central character grappling with two opposing personalities within the same body. Thus, we can conclude that \\"Hyde, Jekyll, Me\\" is indeed based on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character, albeit taking a more lighthearted and romantic approach to the story in the context of a modern South Korean setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The words \\"brave\\" and \\"sweetly\\" carry positive emotional connotations, suggesting praise from the reviewer. In this context, \\"brave\\" may imply that the reviewer felt the movie tackled challenging or sensitive issues in a bold and courageous way, not shying away from them but rather confronting them head-on.

It indicates a strength in the movie that the reviewer appreciated. \\"Sweetly,\\" on the other hand, suggests that there was a gentle, tender, or heartfelt aspect to the movie that the reviewer found endearing or touching. It could refer to the emotional tone of the movie, the relationships between characters, or poignant moments in the storyline. Thus, combining these two adjectives gives the impression of a movie that balances an ambitious or daring approach with moments of warmth, compassion, or sensitivity, and that blend has left a positive impression on the reviewer.

Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

This hearty dish is perfect for those who want a simple yet delicious meal that can be enjoyed at any time of the day. The ingredients are readily available, which makes this recipe convenient and perfect for both beginners and seasoned cooks alike. In this article, we will explore the step-by-step process of making these fish and potato patties that you wouldn't want to miss out on. Ingredients: - 4 medium-sized potatoes - 2 cups cooked and flaked fish (can use salmon, cod, or any other white fish) - 2 large eggs - 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley - 1 small onion, finely diced - 1 cup breadcrumbs - Salt and pepper to taste - Butter or oil for frying Instructions: 1. Poaching and peeling the potatoes: Start by preparing the potatoes. Rinse and scrub them thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt and debris. Then, place the potatoes in a large pot and fill it with enough water to cover all the potatoes completely. Add some salt to the water and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and let the potatoes cook until they become tender. You can check the tenderness of the potatoes by gently piercing them with a fork or a knife. Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and let them cool down slightly. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, carefully peel off the skin and discard it. Set the peeled potatoes aside for later use. 2. Preparing the fish: Flake the cooked fish into small pieces and discard any skin or bones. You can use your preferred type of fish, such as salmon, cod, or any other white fish. If using canned fish, ensure that you drain it properly before flaking. 3. Mixing the ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the peeled potatoes and flaked fish. Using a fork or a potato masher, mash the ingredients together until thoroughly mixed. Add the eggs, chopped parsley, finely diced onion, and breadcrumbs to the fish and potato mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste, making sure to mix well. The mixture should have a consistency that allows it to hold its shape when formed into patties. 4. Forming the patties: Divide the mixture into eight equal portions. Using your hands, gently form the portions into rounded, flat patties. Be sure not to overwork or compact the mixture too much; this will ensure that you have light and tender patties. Place the formed patties on a tray or plate and set them aside. 5. Frying the fish and potato patties: In a large frying pan or skillet, add enough butter or oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Heat the butter or oil over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Carefully place the patties in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd them. You may need to fry the patties in batches depending on the size of your pan. Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and crispy. Adjust the heat accordingly to ensure that the patties are cooked through without burning the exterior. Once cooked, remove the patties from the pan and let them drain on paper towels to remove any excess oil. Serving Suggestions: These fish and potato patties are delicious when served with a side of tartar sauce, mixed greens, or even a simple cucumber salad. Enjoy them as a main dish, or as a tasty appetizer for your next gathering. No matter how you serve them, these fish and potato patties are sure to be a hit! Conclusion: This fish and potato patties recipe is an easy and delectable option for various occasions. Not only will this dish impress your family and friends, but it will also showcase how versatile and enjoyable fish can be. Take the chance to experiment with different fish types, seasonings, and sides to make this dish uniquely yours. Happy cooking!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856? Answer the above question based on the context below: George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

We have an equation: 3 * z - 309 + 294 = 0 First, let's add the numbers -309 and 294. It is like having -309 candies and gaining 294 candies, so you would mostly get rid of your debt, but you would still owe: -309 + 294 = -15 So now our equation looks like this: 3 * z - 15 = 0 Next, we want to find out how many candies we need to add to -15 to get 0. In other words, we need to make -15 into 0, which means to add 15: 3 * z - 15 + 15 = 0 + 15 So we have: 3 * z = 15 Now, we need to find out how many times we need to add 3 to get 15. You know, like how many groups of 3 candies we need to have 15 candies in total. We do this by dividing 15 by 3: z = 15 / 3 When we divide 15 by 3, we get: z = 5 And there you have it!

What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii.

Answer the following question: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave. Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day? Hint: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Answer:","completion":"Considering the influence of circadian rhythms on human biology and behaviors, it is more likely that Jason, the average guy who goes to work each day, follows a more regular meal schedule than Brad, who lives in a dark cave with limited exposure to natural light. Circadian rhythms operate on a 24-hour cycle and are significantly influenced by external factors such as light and darkness. The biological clock, located in the hypothalamus of the brain, is responsible for regulating these rhythms by sending signals to the body. These signals cause changes in behaviors and body processes, such as sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, body temperature, and digestion. In Jason's case, he has a more typical routine, including exposure to natural light when he goes to work, exercises, or goes out. This exposure to light influences his biological clock, creating a more structured and consistent daily routine. As a result, his body is likely to send hunger signals at regular intervals, aligning his meal times with typical societal schedules. On the other hand, Brad lives in a dark cave with almost no exposure to natural light, which can disrupt his circadian rhythms. Without the crucial external cues provided by natural light, his biological clock may become desynchronized, which can lead to irregular eating patterns. Although he may still follow a routine by lighting candles, the absence of natural light ultimately makes it more challenging for him to maintain a consistent meal schedule. Taking these factors into account, Jason would be more likely to eat meals at the same time each day due to the influence of circadian rhythms and his exposure to natural light, which is essential in regulating his biological clock and coordinating daily activities and bodily processes, including digestion and hunger signals. Conversely, Brad's limited exposure to natural light, living in a dark cave, could disrupt his circadian rhythms, making it less likely for him to consistently eat meals at regular intervals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: + live in a city; + stay home; + refuse to take walks; Answer:","completion":"Before Remy found the money in the city, it is essential to establish the context and actions leading up to that moment. Based on the three given options: living in a city, staying home, or refusing to take walks, the most relevant choice would be Remy living in a city. Here is a detailed answer explaining the context and actions that would lead to Remy finding money in the city: Remy would first need to establish a life for himself in a city. This process would involve him finding a suitable place to call home, such as an apartment or a house, close enough to the heart of the city to make it easily accessible. Before moving in, he would need to make sure that his new home provides all the required amenities such as gas, electricity, and water connections. Additionally, Remy would need to secure a stable source of income so he can afford to pay for his living expenses. This could involve finding a job or running a business, depending on his skills and interests. After securing his financial stability, it would be essential for Remy to familiarize himself with the city's geography to better navigate its streets and make use of the public transportation systems, such as buses, subways, or taxis (if available). Remy would also need to build connections in the city by forming friendships and acquaintances with his neighbors, coworkers, or people he encounters in day-to-day life. These connections would allow him to establish a social circle within the city, which could lead to opportunities for discovering places of interest and expanding his understanding of the local culture and language, especially if Remy moved to a city of a different cultural background or one that has another primary language. Furthermore, Remy must become acquainted with the city's administrative and legal systems, such as understanding the local tax regulations, traffic rules, and public services provided by the local government. This knowledge will help him avoid any potential issues that may arise due to a lack of knowledge or misinformation about the city's regulations and laws. Now that Remy has settled comfortably in the city, he may decide to explore his surroundings and take walks around the different neighborhoods and districts. During one of these walks, Remy would then encounter the scene mentioned in the given context: walking in the city by himself and finding money near a particular sector. Depending on the circumstances, Remy might choose to either keep the found money or perhaps search for the owner and return it, exhibiting his moral values and character. In summary, for Remy to come across money in the city, he needs to live in a city, become familiar with its setup and systems, and take walks to explore the various areas. With this context, finding money in the city would be possible during one of his leisure walks or while running errands in the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Drop a 'Goebbels.'\\" Whitman, not unexpectedly, is steamed.","completion":"Title: Jerry Brown Compares Meg Whitman to Nazi Leader as Campaign Heats Up In the ongoing California gubernatorial race, Democratic candidate Jerry Brown, who currently has 20 million in his campaign coffers, is facing a formidable opponent in Republican Meg Whitman. Whitman, who has already spent 71 million securing the Republican nomination, seems to have Brown worried, with the Democratic candidate drawing comparisons between Whitman and Nazi propaganda master Joseph Goebbels. Brown, who is also California's Attorney General, highlighted Goebbels' role in developing propaganda and controlling public opinion during the Nazi era. \\"Goebbels invented this kind of propaganda. He took control of the whole world,\\" Brown stated this week while jogging in Oakland. The comparison stemmed from Brown's belief that Whitman's campaign is driven by her ambition to become the first female president of the United States. \\"She wants to be president. That's her ambition, the first woman president. That's what this is all about,\\" Brown noted. His comments were first reported by a KCBS radio reporter who happened to encounter Brown while jogging and subsequently shared the story on his blog. The issue quickly became the center of attention, with Joe Garofoli of the San Francisco Chronicle offering an analysis of the situation. Garofoli commented that Brown's choice to compare Whitman to Goebbels was a \\"quickest, most hackneyed (and yes, most offensive) way to demonize an opponent.\\" He added that Brown resorted to the easiest method to criticize his opponent, which is to simply \\"drop a 'Goebbels.'\\" Unsurprisingly, Whitman's camp reacted negatively to Brown's comments, expressing disappointment in the Democratic candidate's decision to use such offensive language and comparisons to attack his opponent. As the campaign proceeds, the controversy surrounding Brown's remarks is likely to continue impacting the ongoing political battle for California's governorship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By David Mccormack Singer Heather Naylor of The Electric Barabellas has accused Sydney Holland of wrestling control of Sumner Redstone's life and forcing him to pull support for her MTV series, which was canceled in 2013 Media mogul Sumner Redstone’s complicated professional and private life is being played out in court with his 43-year-old live-in girlfriend involved in a potentially damaging legal battle with the star of an ill-fated MTV reality series that the 91-year-old billionaire had befriended. The nonagenarian’s girlfriend Sydney Holland has been waging her legal battle against Heather Naylor, a singer who starred in the short-lived MTV series The Electric Barbarellas, since August. ‘Holland grew jealous of Naylor's relationship with Redstone and made efforts to cut off all ties between Redstone and OPTIONS: - David Mccormack so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Forbes so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Heather Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Holland so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - MTV so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Redstone so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Singer so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Singer Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Sumner Redstone so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Sydney Holland so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - The Electric Barabellas so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - The Electric Barbarellas so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. - Viacom so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint.","completion":"The correct answer is: - Heather Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint. The whole story pointed out a situation between Heather Naylor and Sydney Holland. Sydney Holland was accused of trying to control Sumner Redstone, and she wanted to cut all ties with Heather Naylor. Here's why the other answers are wrong: David McCormack, Forbes, MTV, Singer, Singer Naylor, Sumner Redstone, Sydney Holland, The Electric Barabellas, The Electric Barbarellas, and Viacom are not correct because Sydney Holland was not trying to cut all ties with these people or things. She was specifically trying to cut ties with Heather Naylor. \\"Holland so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage\\" does not make sense because Sydney Holland would not cut ties with herself. \\"Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage\\" is incorrect due to the lack of a first name. The correct choice should include Heather's full name, Heather Naylor. \\"Redstone so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage\\" is wrong because she wasn't trying to stop talking to Redstone- she wanted control over him! So think about it like this: if two kids are playing tag, and one kid wants to make sure they're always 'it' so they can always be in control, they will try to stop the other kid from being able to tag anyone else.

During this phase, the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis. Interphase is the 'daily living' or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, reads its DNA, and conducts other \`\`normal'' cell functions. The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase. This phase was formerly called the resting phase. However, interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting; rather, the cell is living, and preparing for later cell division, so the name was changed. A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis. However, since mitosis is the division of the nucleus, prophase is actually the first stage. What's the best answer to this question: interphase is a phase of mitosis true or false?","completion":"False. Interphase is not a phase of mitosis. It is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life preparing for cell division, but it occurs before mitosis begins.

Does the word \\"feeling\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? I had a strange feeling in my leg. She had a feeling of euphoria.","completion":"Though the word \\"feeling\\" is used in both sentences, it takes on slightly different nuances of meaning in each context. Let's analyze each sentence to get a clearer understanding of the subtle distinctions between these two uses. 1. I had a strange feeling in my leg. In this sentence, \\"feeling\\" refers to a physical sensation experienced by the person. It could indicate an unusual muscular pain, numbness, a tingling sensation, or any other unexpected sensory change in the leg. This use of \\"feeling\\" is mainly related to the physiological aspect of the individual and concerns the perception of bodily sensations. It can often point to something being wrong, or at least out of the ordinary, with their physical condition. 2. She had a feeling of euphoria. In this context, \\"feeling\\" is used to describe an emotional or psychological state of an individual. Euphoria is a feeling of extreme happiness, joy, elation, or well-being, and it occurs as an internal reaction to an external event or a particular situation. In this scenario, the term \\"feeling\\" alludes to the person's emotional condition and mental experience and is not directly related to bodily sensations or physical aspects. To summarize, while both sentences use the term \\"feeling\\", the first sentence interprets it as a physical sensation, and the second one associates it with an emotional or psychological state. Both contexts involve perception and awareness, but utilize it on distinct aspects of human experience – physiological versus emotional."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we are going to talk about something very important. Do you know what a refugee is? A refugee is a person who has to leave their home and country because it's not safe for them there. They might be very scared or sad, and they need to find a new place where they can feel safe and happy. Unicef, a big group that helps children all around the world, has some news for us. They say that in the last 10 years, the number of children who are refugees has doubled. That means there are now two times as many kids who had to leave their homes as there were 10 years ago. That's a lot of kids! But why are so many children becoming refugees? There are many reasons. Some kids have to leave their homes because of wars or fights between people in their country. Others might have to go because there are not enough food or water, or they feel scared because of bullies. Unicef wants to help these children who are refugees. They believe that every child should have a chance to be safe, healthy, and happy.

It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach. - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop . - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.

In Sentence 1: \\"The teacher asked how many people made up his home.\\" In this context, \\"home\\" refers to the people who live together in a single household, as in a family or a group of individuals residing under the same roof. The teacher is inquiring about the number of people that make up the student's family or household. In Sentence 2: \\"Deliver the package to my home.\\" Here, \\"home\\" refers to the physical location or building where the person lives. It could be a house, apartment, or any other type of dwelling. The focus is on the actual place, not the people living in it. Though the word \\"home\\" is used in both sentences, the meanings are different due to the context in which they are used. In the first sentence, the emphasis is on the individuals who live together, while in the second sentence, the focus is on the place where the person resides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a public relations battle featuring two well-known masters of the media, a beauty queen, and a controversial question: Should someone born a man be allowed to compete in the Miss Universe pageant? On the East Coast was Donald Trump, the New York business tycoon whose fortune and brand is boosted by his ability to navigate storms of controversy. On the West Coast was Gloria Allred, a Beverly Hills lawyer legendary for her ability to draw hordes of cameras to her law office to capture her outrage over alleged injustices done to her clients. The client is Jenna Talackova, a 23-year-old, 6-foot-1-inch blond Canadian, who underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago. Talackova won a regional beauty crown qualifying her for Canada's national title, but she was then told the Miss Canada Universe pageant in Toronto on May 19 was only open to \\"naturally born females.\\" \\"I am a woman,\\" Talackova said in a prepared statement she read to reporters in Allred's conference room Tuesday. \\"I was devastated and I felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust.\\" Allred attacked Trump, who owns and controls the Miss Universe franchise, for questioning Talackova's sexuality. \\"She did not ask Mr. Trump to prove that he is a naturally born man or to see photos of his birth to view his anatomy to prove that he was male,\\" Allred said. How she became a female is not important, she said. \\"The Miss Universe competition is designed to find the one person in the world whose human qualities make them worthy of the Miss Universe crown and title,\\" Allred said. \\"Jenna is beautiful in every way. Her life story will undoubtedly inspire people throughout the world.\\" Talackova, in a 2010 interview, said she knew she was a girl at age 4. She said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19. Trump, warned of Allred's attack when the lawyer alerted reporters Monday afternoon that she would hold the news conference, shifted his pageant's position in an announcement Monday night. Talackova could compete provided \\"she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, and the standards established by other international competitions,\\" the Miss Universe Organization said. Trump's maneuver didn't appear to temper Allred's outrage. \\"The last-minute statement by Mr. Trump's representative put out late yesterday only confuses the issue,\\" she said. \\"Instead of stating clearly that Jenna will be allowed to compete, Mr. Trump qualifies it by adding conditions that are ambiguous.\\" She asked Trump for \\"a clear answer -- not a wimpy, wishy-washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank.\\" Allred didn't know it then, but Trump gave a clearer statement to CNN in New York two hours earlier. \\"We went by the laws of Canada and the laws of the United States, and those laws say that she should be allowed to enter the pageant,\\" Trump said. \\"So she will be entering the Miss Canada pageant.\\" When read Trump's new statement, Allred paused for several seconds and said \\"I stand by my statement. We want this rule eliminated.\\" \\"We want a clearer statement that this rule will be eliminated,\\" Allred said. \\"Step up, say it loudly, say it clearly, this rule will never be in effect again for anyone.\\" Allred declined to have Talackova react to Trump's decision to let her compete. \\"Sorry,\\" Talackova whispered to a reporter, apologizing for her silence. Allred would not say if her client still intended to compete in the pageant. Controversy over pageant rules is not new for Trump. The media stir over Miss California Carrie Prejean's same-sex marriage comments at Trump's Miss USA pageant three years ago raised the profile of that competition. Prejean, in response to a question from a judge, declared her opposition to same-sex marriage. Trump initially said Prejean could keep her Miss California title despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. He eventually fired her for \\"contract violations,\\" including missed public appearances. Allred has affected more than beauty contests. She hosted several news conferences in 2010 to reveal evidence that Meg Whitman, who was then the Republican nominee for governor of California, employed an undocumented worker. The October surprise hampered Whitman's campaign at a crucial time in her race against Jerry Brown, who won the election. CNN's Doug Hyde contributed to this report.

Given the following context: Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who renounces his and his descendants' rights to the French throne?","completion":"Based on the given context, the full name of the person who renounced his and his descendants' rights to the French throne is Philippe of Anjou."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.

More than 50 years after the fact, Cuba has published the diary that Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara kept during the armed struggle that he waged alongside Fidel Castro from the Sierra Maestra mountains. \\"Diary of a Combatant\\" recounts Guevara's experiences from coming ashore in Cuba on December 2, 1956, until shortly before the bearded rebels declared victory January 1, 1959. According to Guevara's widow, Aleida March, the goal is \\"to show his work, his thoughts, his life, so that the Cuban people and the entire world get to know him and don't distort things anymore.\\" The book was edited by the Che Guevara Studies Center, which is directed by March, and published by Australia's Ocean Press/Ocean Sur.

This tiny slice of the south works as a summer diversion that works out what used to be worked out by reading a good paperback. 2. Though structurally messy and visually shapeless, The Help deserves to be seen for its novel subject and thematic concerns, and pleasure of watching good acting. 3. With its focus group-tested quotient of laughs and tears targeted to lowest-common-denominator audiences, writer-director Tate Taylor's vulgar The Help is as much a piece of assembly-line hackwork as any Transformers sequel. 4. If only The Help accepted more of Davis’ help, we might have a work of art on our hands instead of another condescending, half-baked history lesson. 5. What was once a perfect summer book has now become the perfect summer movie. 6. A superbly adapted story with extraordinary performances from an ensemble cast. It is as inspirational as it is powerful. And it is laced with rich humor throughout. 7. The Help polishes the civil rights era like its heroic maids shine the silverware... It's a movie of terrific performances and rousing comeuppances, with a side order of cornpone for the soul. 8. Provocative and powerful, it's a multi-racial, multi-generational 'must see.' 9. The Help demonstrates the conned intelligence of the \\"post-racial\\" and \\"postblack\\" Obama era, where the anxieties of unequal yet mutually beneficial black-white relationships are conveniently, speciously, put behind us. 10. [The Help] is, in some ways, crude and obvious, but it opens up a broad new swath of experience on the screen, and parts of it are so moving and well acted that any objections to what's second-rate seem to matter less as the movie goes on. Summary:","completion":"The movie \\"The Help\\" is about people in the south during a time when things were not fair for everyone. Some people think it is a good movie to watch in the summer, and it's like reading a good book. The movie has some problems with how it looks and its story, but it is still interesting and has very good acting. Some people think the movie tries too hard to make people laugh and cry, and it is not as special as other movies. The movie could be better if it listened to one of the main actors more. Many people think the acting and story are very good, and it makes them feel happy and inspired. The movie talks about a time when people fought for equal rights, and it shows how everyone can work together. Some people think the movie is not very smart because it tries to ignore problems between different races. Overall, the movie has some good parts and some not so good parts, but it can still be enjoyable to watch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Review: Gere and Danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his flock. Gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out. He is training, new comer Allison, to take over his job. Gere sees his flock as very sick, disturbed puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list, and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. He keeps getting warned for this behavior, hence the reason he is being replaced. During his final few days on the job, a young girl goes missing, and Babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray. Him and Allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone AWOL. So, he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police. That part is a little far fetched. There is some sick, twisted stuff shown in this film. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other. Also, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see what sick freaks they are. However, I wouldn't call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film.

Question: \\"What language was replaced in Central Asia?\\" Context: \\"The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.\\" Answer:","completion":"The language that was replaced in Central Asia is primarily the group of Iranian languages, which were once spoken across a vast region including parts of Central Asia, Western Iran, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus. This displacement occurred due to several factors such as the spread of Arabic, Turkic languages, and the assimilation by the Proto-Slavic population. The Iranian languages that were displaced or replaced include Sogdian, Bactrian, Scythian, Sarmatian, Alan, and others. In Western Iran, the spread of Arabic into areas like Khuzestan led to the displacement of some Iranian languages as the influence of the Islamic Caliphate grew. This Arabic influence became more pronounced following the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century. In Central Asia, Turkic languages began to spread across the region as various Turkic tribes and confederations expanded their territories. These Turkic languages, such as Khazar, Kipchak, and Oghuz, influenced and eventually replaced Iranian languages like Sogdian and Bactrian in several parts of modern-day Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The displacement of Iranian languages in Eastern Europe can be attributed to the absorption and assimilation by the growing Proto-Slavic population. This occurred across the territories of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, which were once the core regions of the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans. By the 6th century AD, these regions had been substantially Slavicized, leading to the extinction of the once dominant Scythian languages. Today, only a few remnants of the once widespread Iranian languages are still spoken in isolated pockets. Yaghnobi, a close relative of Sogdian, is spoken in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand. Saka, another Scythian language, survives as Ossetic in the Caucasus. Additionally, a number of small Eastern Iranian languages persist in the Pamir Mountains region. In conclusion, the Iranian languages were largely replaced in Central Asia and other regions due to the spreading and influx of new languages like Arabic and Turkic, as well as socio-cultural assimilation by the expanding Proto-Slavic population. The displacement of these languages signifies an important linguistic and cultural transition in the region throughout history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To properly address the question of whether the statement \\"It's a terrible idea and I don't want it to work\\" follows from the original assertion, it is necessary to delve into the context and reasoning behind both opinions. The given information does not provide enough insight into the situation or idea being assessed, making it difficult to definitively determine a direct correlation between the two perspectives. The original statement, \\"I think basically it's a good idea you know I hope it works,\\" implies that the speaker believes the idea has potential and wishes for its success. However, this statement alone does not provide any information about the specific idea itself. On the other hand, the contrasting statement \\"It's a terrible idea and I don't want it to work\\" conveys a negative opinion about the idea, suggesting that the speaker thinks it is flawed or detrimental. Again, without any context or information about the idea or situation in question, it is challenging to discern any links between the two perspectives. People's opinions often differ based on their individual experiences, beliefs, values, and understanding of a situation. Consequently, without further context or clarification regarding the particular idea being discussed, it cannot be determined whether these two viewpoints are directly related, completely opposite, or even based on differing understandings of the same concept. In conclusion, due to the lack of information and context provided, it is not possible to tell if the statement \\"It's a terrible idea and I don't want it to work\\" follows from the original assertion.

Translate to English","completion":"This passage, \\"23 Что легче сказать: прощаются тебе грехи твои, или сказать: встань и ходи?\\", translates from the Russian language to English as: \\"23 Which is easier, to say: 'Your sins are forgiven', or to say: 'Stand up and walk?'\\" This question deals with the concept of forgiveness and the power of healing. In a broader context, it questions whether it is easier to forgive someone of their transgressions or sins, or to command them to overcome a physical ailment and be able to walk again. Since the desired answer should be detailed and lengthy, let's analyze this question further. The question of whether it is easier to say \\"Your sins are forgiven\\" or \\"Stand up and walk\\" can be approached from different perspectives. Let's examine three common standpoints: a psychological, a theological, and a societal angle. From a psychological perspective, uttering words of forgiveness might be easier for an individual who is empathetic and understanding of human flaws. We know that people make mistakes and may cause harm to others, often unintentionally. Therefore, forgiving someone can provide a sense of relief and closure to both the forgiver and the forgiven. On the other hand, commanding someone to stand and walk can be more difficult, especially if that person has a severe physical disability. It could involve an emotional struggle and an immense responsibility of willpower for the person giving the command. Theologically, this question has strong ties to religious beliefs and teachings. For instance, in Christianity, Jesus is known to have uttered both of these phrases to the sick and the sinful. The act of forgiving sins showcases spiritual power and divine authority, while healing physical ailments reveals a mastery over the physical world. Both expressions hold significant weight, and one may argue that neither is easier to say than the other. Each statement represents a spiritual gift and an exceptional ability to bring about change. From a societal perspective, these two phrases reflect different values and priorities. Forgiving someone of their sins is a personal action that is associated with emotional and spiritual growth. It emphasizes the importance of compassion, understanding, and the capacity to let go of past grievances. In contrast, telling a person to stand and walk often implies that physical health and ability are highly valued, potentially above spiritual well-being. In this context, choosing which phrase is easier to say may depend on an individual's or society's priorities and values. In conclusion, the question \\"Which is easier, to say: 'Your sins are forgiven', or to say: 'Stand up and walk?'\\" explores the complexities of forgiveness, healing, and human power. When evaluated from different perspectives, the difficulty of saying either phrase depends on the psychological, theological, or societal context in which it is presented. The underlying message illustrated by the question is that the power to forgive and the power to heal are both significant, and their importance cannot be underestimated. Ultimately, the question encourages self-reflection and the understanding of the duality of human nature and divine intervention."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: It doesn’t matter which equation you decide to work with or even which variable you choose to solve for, as you should find the same solution no matter what. However, you do want to make the process as simple as possible. You should choose the equation that you think will be easiest to work with. For instance, if there is an equation where one of the coefficients is 1, such as x - 3y = 7, you would choose that as it will be easy to solve for ‘x’. For example, let’s say our equations are: x - 2y = 10 (equation A) and -3x -4y = 10 (equation B). You would choose to work with x - 2y = 10 because the coefficient of x in this equation is 1. Solving for x in equation A would meaning adding 2y to both sides. Therefore, x = 10 + 2y. For this step, you will need to insert (or substitute) your solution for ‘x’ into the other solution that you did not work with. This will allow you to find the other variable, in this case ‘y’. Let’s try it: Insert the ‘x’ of equation B into equation A: -3(10 + 2y) -4y = 10. You can see that we have taken ‘x’ out of the equation and inserted what ‘x’ equals. Now that you have removed one of the variables from the equation, you can solve for the other variable. This is is simply solving a regular one-variable linear equation. Let’s solve ours: -3(10 + 2y) -4y = 10 so -30 -6y -4y = 10. Combine the y’s: -30 - 10y = 10. Move the -30 over to the other side: -10y = 40. Solve for y: y = -4. To do this, plug your findings for ‘y’, or the first variable, into one of the equations. Then solve for the other variable, in this case ‘x’. Let’s try it: Solve for ‘x’ in equation A by plugging in y = -4: x - 2(-4) = 10. Simply the equation: x + 8 = 10. Solve for x: x = 2. Plug both of the variables into each equation to make sure that they create true equations. Let’s see if ours work: Equation A: 2 - 2(-4) = 10 is TRUE. Equation B: -3(2) -4(-4) = 10 is TRUE.

That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Where did they get Tiger?

Sourav Chandidas Ganguly ( pronunciation ; born 8 July 1972), affectionately known as Dada (meaning \\"elder brother\\" in Bengali), is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team, Currently, he is appointed as the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal and President of the Editorial Board with Wisden India. During his playing career, Ganguly established himself as one of the world's leading batsmen and also one of the greatest captains of the national cricket team. While batting, he was especially prolific through the off side, earning himself the nickname God of the Off Side for his elegant strokeplay square of the wicket and through the covers. Sourav Ganguly is one of the four members of the Indian Premier League's Governing Council, responsible for all the functions of the tournament. Sourav Ganguly was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta, and is the youngest son of Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly. Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the 'Maharaja', meaning the 'Great King'. Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness. Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time. Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under-15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.

Article: Working at the edge of a coal mine in India, a team of Johns Hopkins researchers and colleagues have filled in a major gap in science's understanding of the evolution of a group of animals that includes horses and rhinos. That group likely originated on the subcontinent when it was still an island headed swiftly for collision with Asia, the researchers report today in the online journal Nature Communications. Modern horses, rhinos, and tapirs belong to a biological group, or order, called Perissodactyla. Also known as \\"odd-toed ungulates,\\" animals in the order have, as their name implies, an uneven number of toes on their hind feet and a distinctive digestive system. Though paleontologists had found remains of Perissodactyla from as far back as the beginnings of the Eocene epoch (about 56 million years ago), their earlier evolution remained a mystery, says Ken Rose, a professor of functional anatomy and evolution at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Rose and his research team have for years been excavating mammal fossils in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, but in 2001 he and Indian colleagues began exploring Eocene sediments in Western India because it had been suggested that perissodactyls and some other mammal groups might have originated there. In an open-pit coal mine northeast of Mumbai, they uncovered a rich vein of ancient bones. Rose says he and his collaborators obtained funding from the National Geographic Society to send a research team to the mine site at Gujarat in the far Western part of India for two weeks at a time once every year or two over the past decade. The mine yielded what Rose says was a treasure trove of teeth and bones for the researchers to comb through back in their home laboratories. Of these, more than 200 fossils belonged to an animal dubbed Cambaytherium thewissi, about which little had been known. The researchers dated the fossils to about 54.5 million years old, making them slightly younger than the oldest known Perissodactyla remains. But, Rose says, the findings provide a window into what a common ancestor of all Perissodactyla would have looked like. \\"Many of Cambaytherium's features, like the teeth, the number of sacral vertebrae, and the bones of the hands and feet, are intermediate between Perissodactyla and more primitive animals,\\" Rose says. \\"This is the closest thing we've found to a common ancestor of the Perissodactyla order.\\" Cambaytherium and other finds from the Gujarat coal mine also provide tantalizing clues about India's separation from Madagascar, its lonely migration, and its eventual collision with the continent of Asia as the Earth's plates shifted, Rose says. In 1990, two researchers from Stony Brook University, David Krause and Mary Maas, published a paper suggesting that several groups of mammals that appear at the beginning of the Eocene—including primates and odd- and even-toed ungulates—might have evolved in India while it was isolated. Cambaytherium is the first concrete evidence to support that idea, Rose says. But, he adds, \\"it's not a simple story.\\" \\"Around Cambaytherium's time, we think India was an island, but it also had primates and a rodent similar to those living in Europe at the time,\\" he says. \\"One possible explanation is that India passed close by the Arabian Peninsula or the Horn of Africa, and there was a land bridge that allowed the animals to migrate. But Cambaytherium is unique and suggests that India was indeed isolated for a while.\\" Rose said his team was \\"very fortunate that we discovered the site and that the mining company allowed us to work there,\\" although, he added, \\"it was frustrating to know that countless fossils were being chewed up by heavy mining equipment.\\" When coal extraction was finished, the miners covered the site, he says. His team has now found other mines in the area to continue digging. Other authors on the study were Luke T. Holbrook of Rowan University, Rajendra S. Rana of Garhwal University, Kishor Kumar of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Katrina E. Jones and Heather E. Ahrens of Johns Hopkins University, Pieter Missiaen of Ghent University, Ashok Sahni of Panjab University, and Thierry Smith of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. ||||| more-in Horses and rhinos likely originated in the Indian subcontinent, over 54 million years ago, according to a new study.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: COLUMBUS, Ohio--The heart operation taking place in the pale-green operating room at the Ohio State University Medical Center was unusual. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly staring into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient.

Paragraph: Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira's origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \\"Island of Timber. \\" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. Question: \\"What is the name of one of the islands that is part of a landmass that some think once fused the continents of Europe and America?\\" Answer: \\"Madeira\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"Madeira\\" is correct based on the paragraph.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Desert plants fall into two sorts according to the way they deal with the problem of surviving drought. There are the drought--avoiders--those which persist only as seeds, ready to spring up when it rains, to flower quickly and produce another crop of seeds, and to die again. There are also the drought--resisters--those which have evolved various methods for strong water, locating underground water, or reducing their need for water by such devices as shedding their leaves. The drought--resisters are perennials ,they manage to live from one rainy season to another, slowly growing bigger and bigger. Of these, the succulents is a small but interesting fraction . They may store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in underground containers. In the American deserts the best--known succulents are the cacti . They come in a wide range of sizes, from 50--foot tall giant saguaros to tiny round cacti about the size of a thumb--nail. They take thick, cylindrical or even spherical forms, thereby exposing a minimum of evaporating surface to the air and light. They are leafless, except in youth, and then the leaves are small. Typically their surfaces are spiny, discouraging thirsty animals, and channeled like an accordion , so the fleshy stem may expand quickly when the plant drinks and contract slowly as it uses up the water. The root system is widespread and shallow, with good reason; only about 3 per cent of the rain that falls on the desert penetrates to any significant depth into soil. A:","completion":"Which of the following statements best describes the two categories of desert plants and their adaptations to survive drought conditions?

B) Drought-avoiders are plants that grow only during the rainy season, while drought-resisters are plants that continue to grow during drought spells, as they can locate underground water sources. C) Drought-avoiders are plants that shed their leaves to reduce water loss, while drought-resisters are plants that store water in their leaves or stems to survive long periods without rainfall.

Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons.

It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774.

It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines the placement of the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Given the question: I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of people participated in a geriatrics study. Group D had people over 65 years old, while group Y had people in their 40's in its composition. Answer this question please: Which group had people with stronger immune systems? The answer is:","completion":"Group Y had people with stronger immune systems. Step 1: Understand the context of the question The provided background information states that old age begins in the mid-60s and discusses various aspects of aging, such as physical and mental health. Step 2: Identify the relevant aspects The question focuses on the immune system, which the background tells us becomes less efficient in old age, increasing the risk of serious illnesses. Step 3: Analyze the demographic information of each group Group D consists of people over 65 years old, which falls within the old age category, while Group Y comprises people in their 40's. Step 4: Connect the demographic information with the question's focus Since immune system efficiency decreases in old age (as mentioned in the background information), we can conclude that individuals in Group Y (with a lower age range of 40s) would have stronger immune systems compared to those in Group D (with an age range of over 65 years)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jia Zhangke (born 24 May 1970) is a Chinese film director and screenwriter. He is generally regarded as a leading figure of the \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement of Chinese cinema, a group that also includes such figures as Wang Xiaoshuai, Lou Ye, Wang Quan'an and Zhang Yuan. Can we infer the following? Jia's career is based in American cinema.","completion":"No, it cannot be inferred that Jia Zhangke's career is based in American cinema. Instead, he is a renowned Chinese film director and screenwriter who works primarily within the Chinese film industry. The \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement of Chinese cinema indicates that Jia Zhangke, along with his peers such as Wang Xiaoshuai, Lou Ye, Wang Quan'an, and Zhang Yuan, is focused on addressing and exploring the sociopolitical and cultural aspects of contemporary China. This movement was a response to the \\"Fifth Generation\\" directors, who primarily focused on broad historical themes. The \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement is known for its depiction of modern China's urban landscapes, post-socialist consumer culture, and the lives of alienated or marginalized individuals. These directors often employ independent filmmaking techniques, including the use of non-professional actors, handheld cameras, and a fusion of documentary and fiction styles. Their work essentially represents a shift from the elaborate, historical themes of their predecessors, concentrating instead on the contemporary complexities of Chinese society. Jia Zhangke's work reflects these traits, as his films are recognized for their realist approach, such as his international breakthrough film, \\"Platform\\" (2000), which portrays the lives of a small theater troupe in rural China. His other notable works include \\"The World\\" (2004), \\"Still Life\\" (2006), and \\"A Touch of Sin\\" (2013). In Jia's films, we observe the transformation of Chinese society and the conflict between tradition and modernity. While his work has been internationally acclaimed and has made an impact worldwide, Jia's career remains based in the Chinese film industry. Although some collaborations with international production companies or film festivals may occur, this does not change the foundation of his influence and impact within the realm of Chinese cinema. In conclusion, it would be incorrect to infer that Jia Zhangke's career is based in American cinema. His prominence, affiliation with the \\"Sixth Generation\\" movement, and the themes explored in his films are all grounded in the context of Chinese cinema and society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are debating between getting a dog or a cat when they decide to flip a coin since they can't agree. The coin comes up tails so they are getting a cat. Unbeknownst to Karen, she is allergic to cats. Kelly has no allergies to animals, but Karen has never lived with cats before so she isn't aware that she is allergic to them. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will have a stuffy nose more often? Hint: An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen . Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. The answer is:","completion":"Karen will have a stuffy nose more often. This is due to her previously unknown allergy to cats. As explained in the hint, an allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen. In this case, the allergen is likely related to the cat they adopted for their apartment. Cat allergens can come from their dander, saliva, and urine and can be inhaled or come into contact with sensitive areas. Allergens can cause a range of symptoms, including sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion, and itchy, watery eyes. Since Karen is allergic to cats and now lives with one, her immune system will be triggered to respond to the allergens present. This exposure will cause an inflammatory response, which will result in Karen experiencing symptoms like a stuffy nose more often than her roommate, Kelly, who has no known allergies to animals. In contrast, Kelly, who doesn't have allergies to animals, will not have the same inflammatory responses to the cat allergens and will therefore not experience a stuffy nose, or other allergy-related symptoms, as frequently as Karen. Perhaps Karen should consider getting tested for allergies, consulting a healthcare professional for advice on how to manage her symptoms, and discussing with Kelly any alternative ways to keep the symptoms at bay while still being able to enjoy the company of their new pet. In summary, given the information provided in the paragraph about Karen's previously unknown allergy to cats, it can be concluded that Karen will have a stuffy nose more often when compared to her roommate, Kelly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Asia Parveen: Caused 57 injuries to the child and later claimed her violent outburst was prompted by hormones. A Muslim woman who repeatedly beat a ten-year-old girl with a steel ladle for not reading enough verses of the Koran was jailed yesterday. Asia Parveen, who was five months pregnant at the time, left the child with 57 injuries and later claimed her violent outburst was prompted by her hormones. The girl managed to escape when Parveen ran to her kitchen for a knife, and was found alone at a bus stop in the early hours of the morning. Parveen, 31, had argued with the girl on August 15 last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court in London heard. She accused the girl of lying about how many verses of the Koran she had read while praying. She then hit the girl with the ten- inch ladle for 45 minutes and forced her to stand with her arms outstretched for four hours. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, escaped when Parveen went to fetch a knife which she brandished, saying she was going to kill her. She was found four hours later, alone and in the cold at the bus stop, by police. Doctors identified 57 injuries, including marks on her arms, legs, elbows and head, when she was examined at hospital. Parveen, a former professional traditional dancer who had toured worldwide, had been fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan before the attack. She was considered to be ‘immoral’ by some in the community in Pakistan for her former dancing career and so wanted the girl to take her religious duties seriously. Parveen, a mother of three, accepted causing some of the girl’s injuries with the ladle but claimed that others must have happened when the girl ‘fell over’. Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, said: ‘The girl was praying from the Koran and Mrs Parveen accused her of lying about how many of the verses she had read. ‘She was ten at the time. Mrs Parveen took a metal spoon about ten inches in size and hit the child with it repeatedly, causing extensive bruising over both arms, her legs and head. ‘Mrs Parveen said she was going to kill the girl and ran to get a knife from the kitchen. ‘The girl had no alternative but to leave at around 10pm.’ Jailed: Asia Parveen launched 'a sustained and vicious attack' with a metal ladle. Jailing Parveen, who is now divorced,. for nine months, Judge Martyn Zeidman ignored pleas in a letter from the. child victim to spare her jail. He. said: ‘You need to understand that this was outrageous behaviour and if. you ever attack a child again, you will go to prison for very much. longer. 'Of course the injuries itself were. not life-threatening but there were so many of them and the pictures and. the body plan prepared by the paediatrician demonstrate there were 57. injuries. ‘Having a very young baby should not be seen as a get out of jail card.’ Parveen, who lives in Hackney, East. London, admitted a single count of child cruelty after initially. insisting she had used the spoon only once or twice on the girl’s arms. and bottom. During further court proceedings, she. admitted in a second plea that she had lost her temper after feeling. ‘hormonal’, ‘isolated’ and ‘ashamed’. She claimed the other injuries had been the result of the girl falling over. She also denied threatening to kill the ten-year-old or picking up a knife. Parveen, who was told the verdict by her Punjabi interpreter, collapsed in the dock while being led down to the cells by guards. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Who played the part of the vulcanologist who warned of impending disaster in the film 'Dantes Peak'?","completion":"In the 1997 disaster film 'Dante's Peak,' the role of the vulcanologist who warned of impending disaster was played by Pierce Brosnan. The character's name was Dr. Harry Dalton, a skilled volcanologist working for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Pierce Brosnan is an Irish actor, who gained immense popularity for his portrayal of James Bond in the famous 007 series. As Dr. Harry Dalton in 'Dante's Peak,' Brosnan played a dedicated scientist who tirelessly tried to convince the skeptical townspeople and the local government authorities that a volcanic eruption was imminent and could potentially cause widespread devastation. His character struggled to save the lives of the people living close to Dante's Peak, a fictional volcano located in Washington State. The film, directed by Roger Donaldson and written by Leslie Bohem, also starred actress Linda Hamilton, best known for her role as Sarah Connor in the 'Terminator' series. Hamilton played Rachel Wando, the town's mayor, who eventually teams up with Dr. Dalton to lead the evacuation efforts before the eruption devastates the town. 'Dante's Peak' was released on February 7, 1997, and although the movie received mixed reviews, its thrilling storyline, special effects, and strong performances by both Brosnan and Hamilton ensured success at the box office. The film grossed 178 million worldwide, further cementing Pierce Brosnan's status as a leading actor in the film industry. Despite some discrepancies in the scientific portrayal of volcanic events, 'Dante's Peak' remains an iconic disaster film and a testament to Pierce Brosnan's versatility as an actor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"A: The United States is divided into various districts based on different categorizations, such as political, judicial, and statistical divisions. Here, we will discuss three main district types: congressional districts, federal judicial districts, and school districts. 1. Congressional Districts: The United States is divided into 435 congressional districts, each of which elects a member to the U.S. House of Representatives. These districts are apportioned based on the population of each state, as determined by the decennial U.S. Census. The number of districts per state can change after a census due to the changes in population. The District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) are represented by non-voting delegates in the House but do not have congressional districts per se. 2. Federal Judicial Districts: Federal judicial districts are established by the U.S. Congress under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, primarily to handle federal cases, including civil, criminal, and bankruptcy matters. There are currently 94 federal judicial districts, which are grouped into 12 regional circuits. Each state has at least one federal district, while more populous states have multiple districts. For instance, California has four federal judicial districts, while New York and Texas have four and three, respectively. 3. School Districts: School districts in the United States are independent governmental entities responsible for overseeing primary and secondary education within their jurisdictions. There is no fixed number of school districts in the country, as the number varies from state to state and is subject to change due to factors like consolidations, dissolutions, or annexations of districts. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, as of the 2018-2019 school year, there were approximately 13,588 public school districts across the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In summary, the United States is divided into 435 congressional districts, 94 federal judicial districts, and approximately 13,588 school districts. It is essential to note that this information is subject to change, especially with regards to school districts and after each decennial census, which may cause shifts in congressional representation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Josip Broz Tito: His best known wife was Jovanka Broz. Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief Aleksandar Ranković as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito, objecting to her energetic personality, opted for the more mature opera singer Zinka Kunc instead. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at Beli Dvor, where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after Tito's strange relationship with Zinka failed. Since Jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power, she also went down in history as Yugoslavia's first lady. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children. How old was Jovanka Broz when she married Tito?","completion":"Jovanka Broz was 27 years old when she married Josip Broz Tito.

However, by 1914, it separated itself from The Times to become a payable weekly magazine, concentrating on literature and societal issues.

This collaboration mirrors a symbiotic relationship as the TLS cooperates intimately with The Times, its elder sibling newspaper. The extent of the synergy between these two involves the online version of the TLS being hosted on The Times website, a strategic decision that enhances visibility, provides accessibility to a broader audience and consolidates their digital presence through the shared platform.

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...
