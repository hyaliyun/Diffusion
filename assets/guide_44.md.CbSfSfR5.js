Translate this to English?","completion":"Previously, it was argued that prophylaxis would reduce the demand for health care. In the past, there was a belief that the implementation of prophylactic measures and preventive healthcare approaches would lead to a decrease in the overall demand for health care services. The underlying assumption of this argument was that preventing diseases and illnesses, particularly through early interventions and public health measures, would result in fewer people needing medical treatments and care, ultimately making the healthcare system more efficient and less burdened. Prophylaxis, in medicine, refers to any measure or intervention taken to prevent the onset or spread of diseases, infections, or other health-related conditions. These preventive measures can range from vaccinations and immunizations to lifestyle changes such as promoting good hygiene, a balanced diet, and regular exercise. Additionally, it can encompass early diagnostic screenings, pre-emptive drug therapies, and even education on the signs and symptoms of various diseases and conditions. One of the primary reasons for advocating for increased prophylactic measures is that many illnesses and diseases can be avoided or at least lessened in severity if they are detected and addressed early on. For instance, vaccinations have led to near-extermination or control of several serious infectious diseases, and regular screenings for other conditions like cancer have resulted in early detection and improved treatment outcomes. However, while prophylactic measures and preventive healthcare may indeed reduce the demand for healthcare services pertaining to specific conditions or diseases, they might not necessarily lead to an overall decrease in the demand for health care. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Aging population: As people live longer, they are more likely to develop age-related health conditions and chronic diseases. Prophylactic measures alone cannot prevent these increases in healthcare demand entirely. 2. Technological advancements: With the constant improvement of medical technology and knowledge, we can now diagnose and treat a wider range of health issues than before, resulting in an increased demand for healthcare services. 3. Rising expectations: As health care standards continue to improve, people's expectations for maintaining good health also increase, leading to a persistently higher demand for healthcare services. 4. Greater access to information: The rise of the internet has provided widespread access to an abundance of information about various diseases, medical treatments, and healthcare options, enabling people to be more proactive about their health and seek care when needed. In conclusion, although prophylaxis and other preventive healthcare measures aim to reduce the prevalence of diseases and illnesses, it remains uncertain whether they would lead to a comprehensive reduction in the demand for health care. Factors such as aging populations, technological advancements, rising expectations, and greater access to information contribute to the ever-evolving complexity of the health care landscape."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The man takes a cab and has the driver stop by a phone booth, where the man makes a pair of calls, one of them long-distance. At that point, Sgt. Don Delgetti of the SFPD awakens his partner, Detective Lt. Frank Bullitt, at his apartment. Bullitt has been trying to get some sleep after a case that stretched to 5 AM that morning and grumpily chats with his partner.After showering and getting dressed, Frank Bullitt is driven by Delgetti and another policeman, Sgt. Carl Stanton, to the plush mansion of politician Walter Chalmers, who is entertaining a vast pool of guests at a function. Chalmers tells Frank of a star witness who will testify against the mob - Johnny Ross - and who needs protection through his appearance to testify on Monday morning. Chalmers clearly hopes to use Ross as well as Bullitt to the benefit of his political career, and leaves Frank and his two partners to guard Ross at the Hotel Daniels, a flophouse near an passing highway.Frank, Delgetti, and Stanton meet the man who had inquired about a Johnny Ross letter, and the man is puzzled about Chalmers putting him up in such a cheap hotel.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

It is considered one of the prestigious professional tennis tournaments, collectively known as the Grand Slam tournaments, which also include the Australian Open, French Open, and Wimbledon. Both Roger Federer and Andre Agassi are acclaimed players in the tennis world, each with numerous accolades to their names. Roger Federer, a Swiss professional tennis player, has been ranked world No. 1 in the Men's Singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) a record total of 310 weeks, and held the no.1 spot for a record continuous 237 weeks. His tally of 20 Grand Slam titles is notable and considered one of the greatest in the history of the sport.

He has eight Grand Slam titles to his name.

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"A prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was the coordinated strategy against the women's movement?\\"? Select from: (A). no.

Even using RaggTopp's cleaner, a soft brush or cloth, it removes the protectant from the top requiring a weekly or more reapplication to repel rain or morning dew. That gets expensive at 20 per container. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in this review, it can be inferred that the user would not strongly recommend this product. Although the product works well in its primary function, there are certain caveats that might deter potential buyers from considering it as their go-to choice. Firstly, the inability to wash the top without removing the protectant considerably limits the product's usefulness. The user has mentioned that, even when using RaggTopp's recommended cleaner and a soft brush or cloth, the protectant is removed from the top. This indicates that the product isn't long-lasting, which could be a significant drawback for potential customers. Washing is an essential part of maintaining items, and if it negates the product's purpose, it prevents users from optimally benefitting from the protectant. Secondly, the need for frequent reapplication adds to the product's overall cost. The user mentioned that this protectant requires weekly or even more frequent applications to maintain its efficacy against rain or morning dew. As the product is priced at 20 per container, frequent reapplication for continuous protection could make this product prohibitively expensive for some users. This creates another hurdle in recommending this product, as cost efficiency is an important factor for many consumers. The review does acknowledge that the protectant works well as long as the top isn't washed. However, given that the aforementioned factors greatly impact the product's usability and effectiveness, it can be concluded that the user would not likely recommend this product wholeheartedly.

Answer:","completion":"The 5th Wave, a science fiction novel written by Rick Yancey and published in 2013, has been compared to a 2006 novel by American writer Cormac McCarthy, titled The Road. The comparison between the two novels can be attributed to the shared theme of survival amidst a dystopian and post-apocalyptic world. Both authors effectively create a sense of urgency and despair through their respective narratives. The protagonists in both novels must navigate harsh, desolate environments as they face countless dangers and challenges that threaten their lives and what remains of humanity. The Road, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, tells the story of a father and his son as they journey through a world that has been ravaged by an unspecified cataclysm that has destroyed most of civilization, annihilating entire ecosystems and blotting out the sun. Along the way, the father and son strive to maintain their humanity and morality as they encounter other survivors, some of whom have resorted to cannibalism and other atrocious acts to survive. McCarthy's haunting and evocative prose captures the stark reality of a world where life hangs by a thread, and the bond between the father and son becomes the heart of their determination to persevere in the face of unimaginable odds. Similarly, The 5th Wave follows the story of a young girl named Cassie Sullivan who is trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world that has been devastated by a series of alien invasions, referred to as \\"waves.\\" These waves have led to the near-destruction of the Earth's human population, with billions of people lost. Cassie must navigate this desolate landscape in search of her younger brother, who has been forcibly enlisted in a military group created to fight against the alien invaders. The novel explores themes of trust, deception, and the strength of human resilience in the face of catastrophe. While the two novels differ in their specific premises – one dealing with the aftermath of a cataclysmic event and the other with an alien invasion – they both present an engrossing portrayal of the human will to survive in a world that is no longer recognizable. The comparisons between The 5th Wave and The Road are well-founded, as the novels both tackle themes of struggle, hardship, and resilience through the lens of their respective protagonists, who are determined to find hope and carry on despite the dire circumstances they face."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Washington (CNN) -- A Green Beret charged with attempting to carry explosives onto a commercial airliner in Midland, Texas, was released from jail Friday. Sgt. 1st Class Trey Scott Atwater was let out on a 50,000 bond into the custody of his supervisor at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Two members of the Army picked up Atwater after a Friday court hearing to escort him back to the base. Atwater, 30, was arrested Saturday after Transportation Security Administration screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 in his carry-on bag. According to a news release issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas, prosecutors have \\"uncovered no information that would suggest that Sgt.

Detailed Instructions: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Sarah told Peyton that he rocked and Peyton was later seen during his concert with Eddie . OPT: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"(1). No The two sentences appear similar, but there is a subtle difference in meaning between them. The distinction arises from the usage of \\"at his concert\\" in the first sentence and \\"during his concert\\" in the second sentence. In the first sentence - \\"Sarah told Peyton that he rocked and Peyton was later seen at his concert with Eddie,\\" the phrase \\"at his concert\\" indicates that Peyton attended a concert, suggesting that he was simply an audience member who went on to be seen with Eddie at the said event. On the other hand, the second sentence - \\"Sarah told Peyton that he rocked and Peyton was later seen during his concert with Eddie,\\" the phrase \\"during his concert\\" implies that Peyton could be the one performing at the concert, as opposed to merely attending it. In this case, he is not only an audience member but also a participant in the concert. The presence of Eddie is mentioned in both scenarios and could indicate that Eddie was attending or participating in the concert as well. To summarize, while both sentences convey that Sarah praised Peyton and he subsequently appeared with Eddie in the context of a concert, the first sentence suggests that Peyton was simply an attendee, whereas the second sentence leans towards the idea that he might have been performing.

This meant that Benjamin's house had higher humidity levels, which facilitated mold growth. Samuel, on the other hand, didn't need to worry about mold, since the dry climate in his area didn't provide a suitable environment for it to thrive. In order to address the mold issue in his house, Benjamin took several steps. First, he contacted a professional mold removal service to assess the extent of the problem and provide recommendations for treatment. This was an essential step because, depending on the severity of the mold infestation, different methods and treatments might be needed. Next, the mold removal service took samples of the affected areas to determine the specific types of mold present. This step was crucial as certain species of mold can produce harmful toxins and pose serious health risks to the occupants of the house. Identifying the specific mold species would help the service properly address and remove the problem. Once the mold species had been identified, the mold removal service proceeded with a thorough cleanup and treatment process. They removed all mold-infested materials and sanitized the affected areas to kill any remaining mold spores. Additionally, they used air scrubbers and HEPA-filtered vacuums to remove mold spores from the air and prevent any potential cross-contamination. After the mold removal process had been completed, Benjamin took preventive measures to control the moisture levels in his house and minimize the chance of future mold growth. He installed a dehumidifier to help regulate humidity levels, as well as proper ventilation systems to improve air circulation. In contrast, Samuel enjoyed a mold-free living environment due to the dry climate of his area. He didn't need to invest in mold removal or humidity control measures, which saved him both time and money.

Start the braid where you part your hair, pulling the front section into a French or Dutch braid as you go along your hairline. Start finishing the braid once you near your ear, using a bobby pin to secure it. Clip the curls using a bobby pin, either pinning them to the side of your head or lifting a section of your curls and hiding the bobby pin underneath. Instead of trying to separate your curls as you braid, which can result in frizz, pull in the entire curl as you braid if necessary. Select the section of hair that you'd like to pull back and twist it a several times. Use bobby pins to pin the strand to the side of your head, or hide the bobby pinned section by securing it under a section of curls. This works well for both long and short curly hair. Put the headband on over your hair so that it rests at the curve in the back of your head. Tuck your hair into the band in 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) sections, starting from behind your ears. After passing a section through, you'll then re-tuck it so that it gradually forms a roll. Work your way towards the back of your head, until all the hair is tucked. Secure the roll with a few bobby pins if needed. The band will be exposed at the top of your head. Pull together the middle-front section of your hair, twisting it into a small bun that sits on the top of your head. Secure the bun using bobby pins or small hair clips. You can loosen the bun before pinning it so that it lays flat on your head. For longer hair, try pulling up the rest of your hair into a ponytail once the bun is secured on top of your head. Braid a 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) section of hair starting from above your left ear. Angle the braid to wrap back around your head and secure it with a small, clear elastic. Repeat this same process using a strand from above your right ear. Once both strands are braided and secured, cross them behind each other before pinning.

Article: Tigers are among the most admired and most feared animals in the world . When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? Options: A: They can run faster hunting alone. B: They can't get along well with other tigers. C: They can hide themselves easily in this way. D: They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers. Answer:","completion":"D: They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers. According to the passage, tigers are probably better than any other land mammal at catching large animals without help, and they hunt alone.

Write an article based on this \\"Air accident investigators have said a reduction in airspeed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Investigator's Report Reveals Overlooked Speed Reduction Led to Fatal Shetland Helicopter Crash Introduction: A recent air accident investigation report revealed that the pilots failed to notice a significant reduction in their helicopter's airspeed during a flight off the coast of Shetland. This oversight ultimately resulted in a tragic crash, leaving a deep impact on the aviation community. In this article, we will explore the details of the incident, the findings of the investigators, and the importance of pilot vigilance in ensuring flight safety. Paragraph 1: The Incident The catastrophic event unfolded when a helicopter carrying passengers and crew took off from the Shetland Islands, an archipelago situated to the north-east of Scotland. Shortly into the flight, a sudden yet critical loss of airspeed occurred, which the pilots on board failed to detect. Consequently, the helicopter plummeted into the sea, resulting in the loss of life and significant damage to the aircraft. Step 1: Briefly introduce the incident. Step 2: Establish the location of the incident. Step 3: Mention the consequences of the airspeed reduction. Paragraph 2: Investigator's Findings Upon investigation, the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) noted that while the helicopter's autopilot system was engaged at the time of the incident, the required airspeed input was not maintained. This significant reduction in speed eventually resulted in the helicopter's loss of altitude and eventual crash. Regrettably, neither pilot on the flight deck took notice of the speed anomaly before it was too late to revive their aircraft's stability. Step 1: Introduce the Air Accident Investigation Branch as the investigating organization. Step 2: Describe the autopilot engagement and its failure in maintaining airspeed. Step 3: Mention that investigators found that pilots did not notice the decline in speed. Paragraph 3: Importance of Pilot Vigilance This tragic incident serves as a vital reminder of the critical role of pilot vigilance in ensuring flight safety. Although modern-day aircraft are equipped with advanced technology and autopilot systems designed to enhance safety and facilitate flight, the responsibility ultimately falls on human pilots to monitor the systems and make appropriate decisions. Continual training, awareness of potential hazards, and regular review of aircraft performance data are all essential aspects of maintaining pilot vigilance. Step 1: Use the incident as a lesson, emphasizing the importance of pilot vigilance. Step 2: Acknowledge technological advancements but clarify the need for human monitoring. Step 3: Suggest methods for maintaining and improving pilot vigilance. Conclusion: The sobering findings of the AAIB investigation into the Shetland helicopter crash bring the issue of pilot vigilance to the forefront. While autonomous systems continue to gain prominence in aviation, it remains the duty of pilots to stay vigilant and maintain a comprehensive awareness of their aircraft's performance. By doing so, pilots can continue to deliver safe, secure, and reliable air travel for passengers and crew members alike. Step 1: Recap the significance of the findings in the investigation. Step 2: Reinforce the importance of pilot vigilance in the age of advanced technology. Step 3: Emphasize the intended outcome: safe and reliable air travel for passengers and crew."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Plymouth Colony lost close to eight percent of its adult male population and a smaller percentage of women and children to Indian warfare or other causes associated with the war.:332 Indian losses were much greater, with about 2,000 men killed or who died of injuries in the war, more than 3,000 dying of sickness or starvation, and another 1,000 Indians sold into slavery and transported to other areas, such as the British-controlled islands in the Caribbean. About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century. Historians estimate that, as a result of King Philip's War, the Indian population of southern New England was reduced by about 40 to 80 percent. The war escalated from a local conflict to involve most of southern New England and reached to other east coast areas as well. The war killed nearly as high a percentage of the Indian population as the plagues of 1616-19. It is estimated that the Indians of New England made up almost 30 percent of the total regional population, but the Indian population had dropped to less than 15 percent by 1680, five years after the war began.:345 The settlers incurred an enormous tax burden to pay for the war, which held back the economy of the entire region for many years.:346 Based on the above article, answer a question.

At the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle, called the lock groove; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record. On some recordings (for example Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, Super Trouper by Abba and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd), the sound continues on the lock groove, which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record. Precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove, since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"A stylus moves through the grooves of a vinyl record."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 16*m + 67 = 19 for m.","completion":"Step 1: In order to find the value of 'm' in the arithmetic equation 16*m + 67 = 19, we need to isolate 'm' on one side of the equation. This involves two main steps - first, deal with the addition or subtraction, and then deal with the multiplication or division. Step 2: To isolate 'm', we need to get rid of '+ 67' on the left-hand side of the equation. Doing so involves performing subtraction on both sides of the equation to maintain equality - if we subtract 67 from the left side, we must also subtract 67 from the right side. Thus, we rewrite the equation as follows: 16*m + 67 - 67 = 19 - 67 The resulting equation becomes: 16*m = 19 - 67 Step 3: Evaluate the expression on the right-hand side (19 - 67). This results in: 16*m = -48 Step 4: Now, to isolate 'm', we need to get rid of the '16 *' part. Similar to what we did before, this involves doing the exact opposite operation on both sides of the equation. Multiplication becomes division in this case. Thus, we divide both sides by 16. The equation becomes: m = -48 / 16 Step 5: Evaluate the expression on the right-hand side (-48 / 16) to find the value of 'm'. The final solution is: m = -3 So, the solution to the equation 16*m + 67 = 19 is m = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Before solving for t, we should first combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have -1492*t - 303*t. Since both terms have t as the variable, we can combine them by adding their coefficients: -1492*t + (-303)*t = (-1492 - 303) * t = -1795 * t On the right side of the equation, we have -75107 + 9903 - 4801. We can simplify this by adding the constants together: -75107 + 9903 - 4801 = (-75107 + 9903) - 4801 = -65204 - 4801 = -70005 Now, our simplified equation is: -1795 * t = -70005 Step 2: Solve for t. Now that we have simplified the equation, it's time to solve for t. We have a single term with the variable t on the left side, and a constant on the right side. To isolate t, we can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of t, which is -1795: -1795 * t / -1795 = -70005 / -1795 t = 39 So, the value for t is 39."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Question: Along with formal settings, where do some Italians avoid speaking their regional language? Is However, to some Italians, speaking a regional language, especially in a formal setting or outside of one's region, may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class, uneducated, boorish, or overly informal. a good answer to this question? OPTIONS: 1). yes; 2). no;","completion":"2). no; A more detailed and accurate long answer to the question would be: Regional languages, also known as dialects, have been an integral part of Italy's linguistic and cultural heritage. Each region in Italy has its own specific dialect, which is often tied to local history, traditions, and pride. However, not all Italians might feel comfortable speaking these dialects outside of their region or in various social scenarios. One of the primary reasons behind this is the prevalence of Standard Italian, which emerged as the official language of Italy when the country was unified in the 19th century. Some Italians might avoid speaking their regional language in formal settings such as the workplace, educational institutions, or governmental offices. In such contexts, they might prefer using Standard Italian to portray a sense of professionalism, unity, and adherence to the norms. It is generally considered appropriate and expected to communicate in the official language when dealing with representatives of other regions or countries, particularly in diplomatic and international relations. Another aspect to consider is the social connotations tied to regional languages. In some cases, certain dialects may be perceived as lower-class, uneducated, or rural, which might make some individuals hesitant to speak their regional language when interacting with people from different parts of Italy or in cosmopolitan cities. Lastly, communication barriers might be another reason for avoiding regional languages in certain scenarios. Italians from diverse regions might face difficulties understanding each other's dialects due to the variations in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. In such instances, utilizing Standard Italian facilitates communication and mutual understanding. While regional languages remain an essential part of Italy's rich cultural fabric, some Italians might choose to avoid speaking them in formal settings, with people outside their region, or where they perceive a possible social stigma. The widespread use of Standard Italian ensures more accessible and effective communication while maintaining a semblance of national unity and common identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: This article: The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

Write a summary based on this article: Image caption The device did not contain metal, which would make it difficult to detect in an airport security check The man who foiled a Yemen-based al-Qaeda \\"underwear bomb\\" plot was a British man of Middle Eastern origin, according to US media. UK officials declined to comment on the reports, but earlier this week the US said foreign agencies were involved in the operation. The agent was sent by al-Qaeda to attack a US-bound plane, but left Yemen and gave the device to US intelligence. The US insists the bomb never posed a threat to the public. Western passport-holders have long been seen as prime targets for militant groups seeking to plan attacks. However, as well as reporting that the secret agent was a British citizen, NBC News in the US also says UK intelligence agencies were \\"heavily involved\\" in his recruitment. The BBC's Paul Adams, in Washington, says it is unorthodox for intelligence agencies to disclose details about each others' operations. If true, the revelations about the undercover agent could raise eyebrows in UK intelligence agencies, he adds. The US is conducting an inquiry into the leak of information, which Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said could hamper intelligence gathering. \\"When these leaks take place, I can't tell you how much they damage our ability to be able to pursue our intelligence efforts,\\" Mr Panetta told reporters at the Pentagon. 'Custom fit' Details of the operation have emerged over the course of this week. US intelligence learned in April of a plot by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), based in Yemen. The group planned to attack a US-bound plane with a sophisticated bomb hidden in a passenger's underwear, an updated version of a 2009 device that evaded airport security. Officials have described the bomb as a \\"custom fit\\" device that would have been hard to detect in airport security checks. It was said to have two forms of detonator and no metal parts, making it more sophisticated than the device that failed to explode on Christmas Day 2009. It then emerged that the would-be bomber was an undercover agent who had been recruited to infiltrate the group. When he was dispatched by al-Qaeda to undertake the suicide mission, the agent left Yemen with the bomb and delivered it to the CIA. The agent is now reported to be safe in Saudi Arabia while FBI analysts in the US are studying the device. USS Cole link killed Experts quoted in the US media say both the 2012 and 2009 bombs bear the hallmarks of AQAP master bomb-maker Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri. His name has also been linked to a plot in October 2010 to bomb a Chicago-bound plane using a device disguised as a printer cartridge. That plan, which AQAP claimed as its own, was also foiled with the help of the Saudi authorities. The undercover agent is also reported to have provided intelligence that led the CIA to conduct a drone strike in Yemen on Sunday that killed AQAP leader Fahd al-Quso. Quso was wanted in connection with the bombing of the American destroyer USS Cole in Yemen 12 years ago. The US was offering a 5m (£3.1m) reward for information leading to his capture or death. In a separate development on Tuesday the Pentagon said the US had restarted military training with security forces in Yemen, which had been put on hold because of political unrest. ||||| NBC's Robert Windrem reports that al-Qaida's would-be suicide bomber was actually a British national, working through British intelligence to infiltrate the terror organization in Yemen. The spy who helped Western intelligence agencies thwart a plot to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner was a British national of Middle Eastern origin, sources tell NBC News. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also say that British intelligence was \\"heavily involved\\" in recruiting the spy, who has not yet been identified publicly, and penetrating the plot by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula to detonate a new, more sophisticated underwear bomb aboard a U.S. jetliner. A senior U.S. counterterrorism official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, would say only that multiple friendly security services were involved in the operation. Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism operation also were involved, other U.S. officials have told NBC News. U.S. and British officials have long reported that AQAP has wanted to recruit Muslims with Western passports to carry out attacks like the one revealed this week. As an example, the officials cited AQAP’s recruitment of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who failed in the Christmas Day 2009 attempt to bring down Northwest Airlines Flight 253 over Detroit. Related stories Yemen Terror group may have made more underwear bombs, US officials say Lawmakers vow investigation of bomb plot leak Insider who thwarted bomb plot was supposed to carry it out U.S. officials have said previously that the bomb -- a refined version of an “underwear bomb” used in two previous failed terror plots -- was driven out of Yemen by the insider into Saudi Arabia. It is now in the hands of U.S. bomb experts at the FBI labs in Quantico, Va., where experts have been examining it for a week, the officials said. The infiltrator also is safely out of Yemen. The insider also provided information that allowed the U.S. to launch a Predator drone strike that killed AQAP's operations chief, Fahd al-Quso, senior U.S. officials told NBC News on Tuesday. Evan Kohlmann, NBC counterterrorism analyst, said he found earlier reports that the spy was a Saudi national not very credible. “AQAP was going to give a suicide bomb to someone with a Saudi passport?” Kohlmann asked rhetorically. “AQAP has been looking for bombers with Western passports, not those who would raise suspicions.” He noted that Abdulmutallab, who tried to detonate an earlier version of the underwear bomb aboard the Northwest flight, better fit the profile AQAP was looking at: a young upper class college student with a Nigerian passport and a multiple-entry U.S. visa. A British national would attract even less attention, he said.

The agent is of Arabic origin but holds a British passport, according to Mustafa Alani, director of security studies at the Gulf Research Center. Alani was briefed on the operation by Saudi counterterrorism officials. The agent, whom another source said had Saudi roots, lived for a long time in the UK and at some point fell in with jihadist sympathizers, Alani told CNN. That made him an attractive target for Saudi counterterrorism agencies, which recruited him about a year ago, Alani said. His background gave him the credibility to infiltrate AQAP, the Yemeni-based branch of the terrorist organization, which is exceptionally careful about whom it accepts and trusts. At the same time, his possession of a British passport enhanced his appeal to the terror group -- because he could travel without a visa to the United States. According to Alani, the agent was sent into Yemen as a potential suicide bomber after the Saudis heard from other informants that a new AQAP plot was in the works. The agent enrolled in an Arabic language school in Yemen in the hope of being talent-spotted by the group. JUST WATCHED Saudi agent in plot had UK passport Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Are fliers safe from new al Qaeda bomb? 02:44 PLAY VIDEO AQAP fell for the bait and the mole connected with the group. After he joined them he had to handle the tremendous pressure of what discovery by al Qaeda would entail, said Alani. Two or three months ago, the agent learned that the group was working on a new device to bomb a U.S.-bound airplane, and he contacted Saudi counterterrorism officials from Yemen. At this point they informed the Americans of the potential threat, and that they had a mole inside the group, according to Alani. The agent was later provided training in how to use the explosive device in a training facility in Yemen, possibly inside a safe house, according to Alani. \\"He received instruction how to how to avoid detection at the airport, how to behave,\\" Alani told CNN. \\"Apparently he was able to convince al Qaeda that he is genuinely ready to carry out the mission.\\" Alani said his understanding was that AQAP intended the would-be suicide bomber to fly through a Gulf country to connect to a U.S. bound flight. The Saudi operation culminated with the agent and another Saudi informant -- likely his handler -- being whisked out of Yemen, Alani said. The Saudis knew they would never be able to use the agent again, and they and smuggled him through a number of Middle Eastern countries to protect him from al Qaeda retaliation, Alani told CNN. \\"My information that he was pulled out after the device was handed to him, and they ordered the green light to carry out the operation. I don't think he was pulled out prematurely,\\" Alani told CNN. \\"The family is secure, and the man is outside the Middle East,\\" Alani told CNN. The device that AQAP bomb-makers had built for the mole was flown from Yemen to Saudi Arabia by Saudi counter-terrorism agents and handed over -- around April 20th -- to U.S. intelligence officials. They subsequently took it to the United States for forensic analysis, Alani told CNN. He also said the intelligence community remained deeply worried that similar devices might be unaccounted for and that AQAP may be planning a similar operation. The details collected from the device brought out of Yemen could allow for important counter-measures to thwart al Qaeda's next operation. The recovered device had two triggering mechanisms -- one involving a chemical reaction and one designed to be set off manually -- to maximize the chances that the device would work, said Alani. It contained 250-300 grams of the high explosive PETN, a slightly smaller amount than that used in two printer cartridges for an October 2010 plot aimed at blowing up cargo planes en route to the United States. Those devices were intercepted after a tip by Saudi counterterrorism, and had the potential to bring down a plane, according to British and U.S. officials. The underwear device used in the attempt to bring down a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009 contained about 200 grams of the same explosive. Saudi counter-terrorism officials believe the device was likely constructed by a team working under the supervision of Ibrahim al-Asiri, AQAP's chief bomb-maker. When the device used in the Christmas Day plot was examined, a set of fingerprints matched those of al-Asiri held in a Saudi database. Alani said al-Asiri was the target of a drone strike last year after Yemeni and Saudi intelligence developed information about his possible location. The Yemenis, he said, subsequently established that another member of the group and not al-Asiri was killed in the strike. Meanwhile, a source working closely with U.S. intelligence agencies and the military told CNN that al Qaeda's Yemeni affilliate now has \\"a whole outfit designated to target the U.S. homeland.\\" The United States believes AQAP is working on \\"several types of bombs\\" that could get past airport X-ray screening machines. Counterterrorism officials in the Gulf and the United States say that AQAP's expansion in Yemen over the past two to three years has given it greater breathing room and resources to plot attacks against the United States. \\"This is going to give them a major advantage in future operations,\\" Alani told CNN. The group operates out of rudimentary training camps in southern Yemen. Thought it has not yet succeeded in any bomb plot targeting Americans, observers say there are several bombmakers and a group of would-be suicide bombers working inside the group. \\"What I think is concerning to myself and other people is that it seems the talent of the organization is getting better,\\" said Gregory Johnsen, a Near East studies scholar at Princeton University. \\"That is, they are much more capable of carrying out attacks. So when something fails, like the Christmas Day plot in 2009 or again, the cartridge plot in 2010, the organization is able to adapt. And the next time they come back, they present a better and more lethal threat. I think that's what has a lot of people in U.S. and Saudi intelligence quite concerned.\\" CNN has previously reported that al-Asiri has been involved in training both bombmakers and suicide bombers. The U.S.-affilliated source said al-Asiri is now not making all the components himself, giving the group extra security and the advantage of having multiple manufacturing capabilities if al-Asiri were to be killed. The source also confirmed that the device the mole turned over had no metallic parts and an advanced detonation system to improve the chances the entire bomb would explode. AQAP bomb designs are aimed at hiding explosives in clothing, camera lenses and animals, according to the source. And the fundamental growth in AQAP's ability to control territory has made them tougher to target since the 2009 incident, Johnsen said. \\"AQAP at that time was about two to three hundred members, and it controlled no territory in Yemen. Now, two and a half years later, the terror group has more than tripled in strength to over a thousand members and it controls a great amount of territory in southern Yemen,\\" Johnsen said. He said the group controls towns, is running its own police department and in some places has established court systems. \\"It's providing services -- electricity and water -- to some of the citizens, and really it sees itself in parts of southern Yemen as a government,\\" he said. |||||","completion":"A British citizen of Middle Eastern origin was reportedly the agent who foiled an al-Qaeda \\"underwear bomb\\" plot in Yemen.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Now, I have a new situation: After working out in the yard for the day doing various chores, Karen comes back inside to prepare for a shower. While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering. Answer this question please: Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided seems to be unrelated to the main process of freezing water in an ice cube tray. The presence or absence of people has no direct impact on the quantity of water needed to fill the tray or the physical process of freezing the water into ice cubes. However, it could be indirectly related in certain situations. If there are not many people present in a gathering or event, the demand for ice cubes might be lower. In such a situation, you may not need to make as many ice cubes or use multiple trays, and the limited water would suffice. On the other hand, if you're referring to the freezer's location being less populated or isolated, it still wouldn't affect the freezing process or the volume of water required. The process remains the same regardless of the number of people present or not: 1. Find an empty ice cube tray. 2. Fill the tray with warm water. 3. Carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degrees Fahrenheit, the freezing point of water. 4. The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid. 5. The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has a greater volume as a solid. 6. Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses.

Thankfully, it came to pass that I was able to watch this animated little treasure. The story is about the child Brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of the township of Kells. The main pre-occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the renowned illustrator from Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan befriended the white forest sprite Aisling, as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration. \\"The Secret of Kells\\" is unlike most of the animation released these days. It is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of \\"Kung Fu Panda.\\" However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting. Try to catch this quiet gem of a film. It is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as \\"Monsters vs. Aliens\\" and the like.

Today, we will dive into the specifics of what you need to consider when picking out a shirt and how to measure your neck and sleeve length accurately. 1. Pick the Color of Your Shirt: The first step in selecting a shirt is choosing the color that best suits your tastes and preferences. Keep in mind that various colors can evoke different emotions and impressions. Whether you prefer a more conservative or bold approach, the appropriate color will help you make a statement and create a polished look. To make the decision easier, it may be helpful to think about the purpose of the shirt – whether it's for work, casual attire, or something more formal. Step-by-step guide: 1.1. Identify the purpose of the shirt. 1.2. Decide on a color palette (neutral, bold, or mix-and-match) given the occasion. 1.3. Choose a specific hue from that palette to fit your personal style. 2. Pick the Pattern of Your Shirt: Along with color, the pattern of your shirt adds visual interest and defines your own sense of style. Some popular choices include solids, stripes, checks, and plaids. Like color, the pattern should also be chosen based on the occasion and your personal preference. Step-by-step guide: 2.1. Assess the compatibility of various patterns with your chosen color. 2.2. Consider the formality of the occasion. 2.3. Select a pattern that speaks to your personality and complements the other components of your outfit. 3. Pick the Collar of Your Shirt: The collar serves as the focal point of any shirt. Various collar styles are available, from classic to casual, including spread, button-down, and cutaway, among others. Each collar style adds a different touch to your overall look, so choose wisely. Step-by-step guide: 3.1. Consider your face shape and how each collar style will frame it. 3.2. Think about the tie knot you will wear if the occasion calls for one. 3.3. Choose a collar style that complements both your face and the intended outfit. 4. Pick the Fit of Your Shirt: The fit of your shirt determines its comfort and how it flatters your body shape. Common fit options include slim, regular, and relaxed. Depending on your build and preferred style, choose the fit that suits you best. Step-by-step guide: 4.1. Assess your body type and decide which fit will best compliment it. 4.2. Consider your comfort preferences: loose, form-fitting, or somewhere in between. 4.3. Select a fit accordingly. 5. Pick the Weave of Your Shirt: The weave plays a significant role in the appearance, weight, and feel of a shirt. It can impact breathability, durability, and the overall aesthetic. Some common weaves are Oxford, twill, and poplin. Choose a weave that suits the chosen fabric and intended use. Step-by-step guide: 5.1. Learn about the characteristics of different weaves. 5.2. Match the weave to the formality of the occasion and your personal preferences. 5.3. Choose a weave based on its benefits and how it complements the other shirt elements. 6. Pick the Fabric of Your Shirt: Fabrics vary widely in terms of quality, durability, and comfort. Popular options include cotton, linen, and synthetic blends. Consider factors such as climate, personal comfort, and required care when making your choice. Step-by-step guide: 6.1. Familiarize yourself with the properties of different fabrics. 6.2. Consider your intended use of the shirt and any climate-related concerns. 6.3. Choose a fabric based on its breathability, care requirements, and comfort. 7. Measure and Determine Your Neck Size and Sleeve Length: To ensure a perfect fit, accurate neck and sleeve measurements are crucial. Before buying a shirt, make sure to take your measurements using a flexible tape measure. Step-by-step guide: 7.1. Wrap the tape measure around the widest part of your neck, leaving enough space for two fingers to slide between the tape and your neck comfortably. 7.2. Write down the measurement, rounding up to the nearest half-inch. 7.3. To measure sleeve length, start from the center back of your neck and extend the tape to your shoulder, following the natural curve of your arm down to your wrist bone. 7.4. Note down the final measurement and round up to the nearest whole number if needed. Conclusion: In summary, choosing the perfect shirt involves considerations about color, pattern, collar, fit, weave, and fabric. Additionally, measuring your neck size and sleeve length can ensure a better fit and overall look. By taking the time to pick out the ideal attributes for your shirt, you'll be well on your way to achieving a polished and fashionable appearance, no matter the occasion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pieter de Jode II or Pieter de Jode the Younger (1606–1674) was a Flemish Baroque printmaker, draughtsman, painter and art dealer. A scion of an important dynasty of printmakers active in Antwerp, he created many prints after the works of leading painters and was a close collaborator of Anthony van Dyck for whom he engraved many portraits. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Pieter was a printmaker because his father was.","completion":"Based on the provided information, one can infer that Pieter de Jode II (or Pieter de Jode the Younger) indeed came from a significant dynasty of printmakers in Antwerp, suggesting that the family's involvement in the profession likely influenced or facilitated his career choice. While the passage does not directly state that his father was a printmaker, it does mention that he belongs to an \\"important dynasty of printmakers,\\" which implies that the profession ran in his family. Moreover, given that Pieter was known as \\"the Younger,\\" it can be assumed that there was an earlier figure in his family - perhaps his father or another close relative - who was also named Pieter de Jode and was involved in the profession. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the sentence \\"Pieter was a printmaker because his father was\\" is possibly true, as his father or other family members were likely involved in the printmaking trade, and this family background probably played a significant role in shaping his career path. However, to accurately confirm this statement, further information about Pieter de Jode II's father and their exact relationship to the printmaking profession would be required."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline.

Avoid consuming alcohol, caffeine, excessive sugar, or acidity. Avoid yelling and screaming. Don’t clear your throat. Humidify your home. Don’t smoke.\\" Article:","completion":"The Importance of Hydrating and Lifestyle Choices for Vocal Health A voice is an imperative tool for communication; a medium that evokes emotion, creates connections, and firms relationships. Nevertheless, it is often subjected to strain and sometimes compromised by factors such as the environment or our lifestyle choices. These factors can cause harm, creating scratches, hoarseness, and even loss of voice. Fortunately, you can prevent these by drinking a lot of water, eating hydrating snacks, avoiding alcohol, caffeine, excessive sugar, and acidity, abstaining from yelling and screaming, not clearing your throat, humidifying your home, and refraining from smoking. This article delves into the importance of these actions for vocal health and how you can incorporate these measures into your daily life. Hydration: Your Body's Best Friend The first step to vocal health is hydration. Remembering to drink ample water daily is essential (the 8 glasses mandate is a good place to start), as this helps maintain the thin layer of mucus on your vocal cords, essential for their proper function. Without this mucus layer, your risk of vocal damage increases significantly. In addition to plentiful water intake, hydrating snacks, such as fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, watermelons, oranges, and carrots, can further boost your water consumption. Their high water content not only aids in hydration but also provides necessary nutrients, vitreous to enhance overall vocal health. Avoid Alcohol, Caffeine, Excessive Sugar, and Acidity Diet plays an indispensable role in vocal health as well. Steer clear of consuming too much alcohol and caffeine since they dehydrate your body, including the throat and vocal cords. Simultaneously, excessive sugar intake can lead to inflammation and acidity in the body, which might cause damage to the vocal cords. Yelling, Screaming, and Clearing Your Throat: The Unfriendly Trio It's also crucial to watch how you use your voice. Strained vocal behaviors such as yelling and screaming are akin to running a marathon without prior practice - bound to cause damage. Clearing your throat, a seemingly benign act, is like a minor abrasion on your vocal cords. Consistent clearing can result in redness and swelling, leading to hoarse voice or loss of voice. Humidifying Your Home for Vocal Comfort Dry air can significantly affect your vocal health. Humidifying your home, especially during the colder months, can prevent your throat and vocal cords from drying out. Utilizing a humidifier to maintain an environment that preserves the moisture in your vocal cords can work wonders for your vocal quality. Kick the Butt: Say No to Smoking Finally, smoking is a red flag for vocal health. Tobacco smoke irritates the throat and can cause substantial damage to your vocal cords over time. The smoke's heat dries out your throat and leads to an accumulation of unhealthy chemicals on your vocal cords. In conclusion, maintaining the health of your vocal cords requires a multifaceted approach that includes hydrating frequently, making conscious dietary choices, and being mindful of vocal strain. It may also necessitate lifestyle adjustments, such as incorporating a humidifier into your home or quitting smoking. Implementing these measures will contribute significantly to your vocal health and longevity, ensuring that your voice—your primary tool for communication—stays clear, resilient, and vibrant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit more nitrogen oxides? Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible. Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Answer:","completion":"Cuba's cars will emit more nitrogen oxides compared to Panama's cars. This is because Cuban cars are primarily from the late 1940s and early 1950s, before the introduction of catalytic converters. In contrast, due to trade relations with Japan, Panamanian cars have the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology. Catalytic converters help reduce harmful emissions, including nitrogen oxides, by converting them into less harmful products. Since Cuban cars lack this technology, they will emit more nitrogen oxides than Panamanian cars with advanced catalytic converters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - An academy (Attic Greek: ; Koine Greek ) is an institution of secondary education, higher learning, research, or honorary membership. - Attic Greek is the main Greek dialect that was spoken in ancient Attica, which includes Athens. Of the ancient dialects, it is the most similar to later Greek and is the standard form of the language that is studied in ancient-Greek language courses. Attic Greek is sometimes included in the Ionic dialect. Together, Attic and Ionic are the primary influences on Modern Greek. - The Western world or the West is a term usually referring to different nations, depending on the context, most often including at least part of Europe. There are many accepted definitions about what they all have in common. The Western world is also known as the Occident (from Latin: \\"occidens\\" \\"sunset, West\\", as contrasted with Orient). - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination. - Arabic (' or ' ) is a Central Semitic language that was first spoken in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.7 billion Muslims. It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, and from northwestern Arabia to the Sinai in the south. - Byzantium (\\"Byzántion\\") was an ancient Greek colony on the site that later became Constantinople, and later still Istanbul. Byzantium was colonised by the Greeks from Megara in . - Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period. - Not to be confused with Olympiodorus the Elder Olympiodorus the Younger ( Greek : ; c. 495 -- 570 ) was a Neoplatonist philosopher , astrologer and teacher who lived in the early years of the Byzantine Empire , after Justinian 's Decree of 529 AD which closed Plato 's Academy in Athens and other pagan schools . Olympiodorus was the last pagan to maintain the Platonist tradition in Alexandria ( see Alexandrian School ) ; after his death the School passed into the hands of Christian Aristotelians , and was eventually moved to Constantinople . - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - Biblical Hebrew (\\"Ivrit Miqra'it\\" or \\"Leshon ha-Miqra\\"), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of Hebrew, a Canaanite Semitic language spoken by the Israelites in the area known as Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term \\"Hebrew\\" was not used for the language in the Bible, which was referred to as Canaanite or Judahite, but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century BCE, and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in the siege of Jerusalem (AD 70). - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

For the note C, sing “one;” sing “three” for E and “five” for G. Sing “one” together at C, then have one person sing “three” at E while the other 2 hold the C. Then, have someone sing “five” at G while the other 2 hold a C and E, respectively. After practicing C-E-G, try other combinations, such as G-B-D and F-A-C. If you’re practicing with 1 other person, just work on 2-part harmonies. perfectly to avoid getting distracted by other singers. It’s easy to get distracted by other singers when you’re harmonizing. The key to sticking to the harmony is to learn your part inside and out. Work measure by measure to commit each of your part’s notes to memory. If you’re in a choir, don’t rely on others in your section (such as other altos or baritones) to stay on track. Additionally, don’t assume that you’ll always be surrounded by other members of your section when you perform. If you have trouble sticking to your part, practice singing with a recording of the melody. Play it softly at first, then gradually increase the volume. The best way to learn how to harmonize is to sing with others in a group. Look for a choir or chorus group at your school or place of worship, or look online for one in your community. If you’re a soprano and want to harmonize better, try to join a choir as an alto. Sopranos usually sing the melody, while alto, tenor, and baritone sections sing harmonies. While apps and other resources can be super helpful, nothing beats working one-on-one with an experienced voice teacher. In addition to harmonizing, a voice teacher can help you with other singing techniques, such as breath control and vocal health. Additionally, consider taking classes in music theory to learn more about how harmonizing works.

Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the character made her debut as \\"the Cat\\" in Batman #1 (June 1940). Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, has been Batman's most enduring love interest and is known for her complex love-hate relationship with him. As a Gotham City burglar, Catwoman typically wears a tight, one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. In June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles, in which Catwoman has a prominent role in the third volume of Batman. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding, opting to include everything under a larger \\"DC Universe\\" banner and naming, and Catwoman continues to be featured in the third volume Batman. The series reveals Selina's origin through a series of flashbacks and letters exchanged between Bruce and Selina. Her parents died when she was young, and she hardly remembers them. She is sent in the Thomas and Martha Wayne Home for the Boys and Girls of Gotham, and even after being placed in various foster, she would escape to return to the orphanage. Eventually, Selina becomes Catwoman. During one of her heists, she is approached by the Kite Man to aide the Joker in a gang war against the Riddler, which she refuses. She later aides Batman, with whom she already has a romantic relationship, to spy on the Joker. She is shot from a window, but is unharmed. At some point in the future, her childhood orphanage is bombed by a terrorist group called the Dogs of War. Batman reluctantly arrests Catwoman after all 237 of them are killed, despite Catwoman's insistence on her guilt. Her first appearance is in Batman #9, where she is revealed to be imprisoned in Arkham Asylum for the alleged murders of the Dogs of War. Batman is determined to prove her innocence, and makes a deal with Amanda Waller to get her off death row in exchange for her help on a mission to Santa Prisca. The mission to find Psycho Pirate is a success, and Batman and Catwoman return to Gotham City. Before Batman can return her to custody, she escapes. Batman investigates the murders of the terrorists that she has been charged with, and deduces that it was in fact Holly Robinson who committed the murders after the terrorists burned down the orphanage she and Selina were raised in. After being attacked by Holly Robinson, Batman is rescued by Catwoman. Bruce proposes to Selina in Batman #24. In issue #32, Selina asks Bruce to propose to her again, to which she says, \\"Yes.\\" The two leave Gotham for Khadym, where Holly Robinson has fled to, to clear Selina's name. Batman Annual vol. 3, #2 (January 2018) centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years. Bruce receives a terminal medical diagnosis, and Selina cares for him until his death.","completion":"This text is about the fictional character Catwoman, also known as Selina Kyle, who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – An oral history project about the South African town of Dududu has turned up a dark secret from the past: the discovery of about 100 bodies in unmarked graves in what is now a sugarcane farm. The investigation is continuing, but the best guess is that they were prison laborers who worked at the farm decades ago, reports AFP. The farm is now run by the sugarcane conglomerate Illovo, which bought it in 1989. As the Independent of South Africa reports, old-timers say that the previous farm owner, now deceased, is believed to have had the prisoners trucked in from nearby Durban, though the exact circumstances are unclear. “Growing up, we knew there were prisoners working there,\\" says one woman. \\"They served their sentences there and when it was over, they would be dealt with and buried there.” Stories differ on whether the prisoners were buried in their old age or whether they were killed well before then, and authorities hope that the investigation of the three mass graves will yield answers. They came to light when a witchdoctor being interviewed for an oral history project spoke of \\"restless spirits\\" at the site, and a dig commenced.","completion":"Title: The Dark Secret of Dududu's Sugarcane Farm: Uncovering the Past through an Oral History Project Introduction An oral history project focused on the town of Dududu in South Africa has uncovered a chilling secret from decades ago, shedding light on a dark period of the community's past. The discovery of approximately 100 bodies in unmarked graves at a sugarcane farm currently operated by Illovo has ignited a quest to uncover the truth behind this mass burial site. The investigation is ongoing, but initial findings suggest that these remains belong to prison laborers who worked on the farm in the past. The Role of the Oral History Project The oral history project aimed at preserving the stories of Dududu's community members and their experiences over the years. It was during one of these interviews that a local witchdoctor spoke of \\"restless spirits\\" haunting the site of the sugarcane farm. This revelation prompted authorities to investigate, which led to the unearthing of the three mass graves. Reports from residents in the area, as recounted by the Independent of South Africa, suggest that prisoners were brought from nearby Durban by the previous, now-deceased farm owner. These prisoners served their sentences by working on the farm. However, accounts differ as to whether the prisoners were buried upon reaching old age or were killed well before their time. Authorities hope that their investigation will provide answers to these lingering questions. Illovo's Role and Responsibility The sugarcane conglomerate Illovo, which purchased the farm in 1989, now finds itself in the center of this historical investigation. While the mass burial seems to predate Illovo's ownership, the company may still have a responsibility to the community and the families of the deceased to assist in uncovering the truth about the events that took place on the farm. Furthermore, the discovery of unmarked graves on Illovo's property raises questions about the ethical implications of using prison labor in agricultural settings. Although the practice has a long history dating back to the colonial era, the conditions in which these workers lived and died need to be examined in order to understand and address potential human rights abuses. Searching for Closure The continuing investigation into the mass graves not only seeks to provide answers for the families of the deceased but also aims to offer closure to the Dududu community. In understanding the history and the circumstances that led to these burials, the community can begin the process of healing and reconciliation. Uncovering historical injustice serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving and recording the past. Oral history projects such as this one play a crucial role in giving a voice to the marginalized and illuminating hidden narratives that would otherwise remain buried, much like the bodies discovered at the sugarcane farm. Conclusion The dark secret unearthed in Dududu offers a unique opportunity to confront past human rights abuses and spark conversation about the ethical implications of prison labor. As investigators work to piece together the events that transpired on the sugarcane farm, the community of Dududu, as well as Illovo and other businesses, must reckon with the consequences of this troubling history. Through collaborative efforts, the town might find answers, share untold stories, and pave the way for healing and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The striker popularly known as 'Chucho' passed away in the Qatari capital Doha, one day after playing his first game for new side El Jaish. Having played at the 2006 World Cup as a youngster, Benitez had developed into an important component of an Ecuadorian side bidding to reach next year's finals in Brazil. His 24 international goals make him the third highest scorer overall for Ecuador's national team. Jose Chamorro, the player's agent, told an Ecuadorian television station that Benitez had suffered a heart attack and died in hospital, where he had been taken after complaining of abdominal pains. Manchester United star Antonio Valencia, an international colleague of Benitez who played with the striker at leading Ecuadorian side El Nacional a decade ago, was among those struggling to come to terms with the loss. \\"This pain (is) very strong my brother but we love you,\\" the winger wrote on Twitter, where he also posted several pictures of the diminutive forward. Despite being a footballer who failed to hit the heights in Europe, news of Benitez's death trended on Twitter. Ecuador's interior minister Jose Serrano was among those who took to the micro-blogging site to comment, writing: \\"Dear Chucho, thank you for your goals and your happiness.\\" Sunderland's Craig Gardner, who played with Benitez at Birmingham City between 2009 and 2010, was also moved to comment. \\"Can't believe Christian Benitez has died,\\" Gardner wrote. \\"I had the pleasure to play with him.

Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat and J.M.W. Turner.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The early paints worked through the use of natural pigments derived from various sources, which were combined with binders to create usable paint. In the early Renaissance, two key lake pigments were used by painters, which were created by mixing dye with either chalk or alum. These pigments included kermes lake, made from the kermes insect, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. Upon the arrival of cochineal, a new pigment known as carmine was introduced. This pigment produced a vibrant crimson color, although it needed to be used carefully due to its propensity to change color over time. This new pigment was embraced by many of the most celebrated painters across the 15th and 16th centuries, such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez, and Tintoretto. Later, it was also employed by other renowned artists like Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat, and J.M.W. Turner. In summary, early paints functioned through the use of natural pigments, which were often derived from plants and insects. These pigments were then mixed with binders to create a stable, workable medium that artists could use to create their masterpieces. Over time, new pigments were discovered, like carmine, which enabled painters to expand their color palettes and create even more striking, vivid works of art. This emphasis on natural pigments and evolving color options played a crucial role in the development of painting during the Renaissance period and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is one man who will be pacing around the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota this week hoping to make it three majors in a row -- but you won't find his name when you trail your finger down the list of starters at the 91st PGA Championship. Tiger Woods possesses a mental toughness that none of his competitors can match. Though his presence may be unnoticed by spectators lining the fairways, his influence on the players he coaches is becoming far more conspicuous. That is because sports psychologist Dr. Morris Pickens, or \\"Dr Mo\\" as his players like to call him, is fast gaining a reputation for being one of the best mental coaches in golf. During practice rounds,","completion":"Dr. Mo can be seen meticulously observing his players, analyzing their swings, and offering invaluable advice to help them hone their mental game. His clients, which include some of the biggest names in professional golf, speak highly of his unique ability to tap into their mindset and bring out their peak performance. He believes that the mental side of the game is just as, if not more, important than the physical, and he has made it his mission to help golfers build their confidence, focus, and resilience under pressure. Being part of their entourage, Dr. Mo moves discreetly in the background, absorbing every detail, every nuance of his players' actions, and reactions. His years of experience and expertise allow him to understand the troubles that affect their performance, address them, and provide effective coping strategies. While his players may be swinging their clubs, he is swinging their minds towards victory. Over the years, Dr. Mo has developed a steadfast process for mental preparation, which includes visualization techniques, positive self-talk, and setting specific yet achievable goals before each shot, each hole, and each round. His method is tailored to the individual golfer's strengths and weaknesses. This year's PGA Championship will be a stage where Dr. Mo's skills will be put to the test on the highest level, and the world's best golfers will be vying for the coveted title. As the event unfolds, it is becoming increasingly evident that his players are reaping the benefits of his guidance, showing remarkable consistency, poise, and determination that set them apart from the rest. In the final round of the 91st PGA Championship, the Hazeltine National Golf Club witnesses a dramatic turn of events. One of Dr. Mo's players – an underdog at the start of the tournament – surges forward, dominating the leaderboard. The crowd, initially oblivious to Dr. Mo's presence, becomes aware of the invisible hand that has guided the player throughout the competition. The tension mounts as the golfers enter the closing holes. Intently watching his player from the gallery, Dr. Mo knows better than anyone the importance of mental resilience at this crucial stage. He sends silent affirmations, assuring the golfer that he has the inner strength to succeed. As the final putt drops, sealing a nail-biting victory, the player raises his arms in triumph, and the crowd erupts in deafening applause. In that moment, as the Cinderella story unfolds, Dr. Mo's work is vindicated: He has turned an unlikely contender into a major champion by harnessing the power of the mind. Though he may not be the one to hold the trophy, his role in the victory is undeniable. The sports world can no longer ignore the impact of a steadfast mental coach like Dr. Morris Pickens, who has ushered in a new era for golf psychology. The 91st PGA Championship will be remembered not only for the underdog's extraordinary win but also for the crucial contribution of the man pacing around the Hazeltine National Golf Club – Dr. Mo, the unsung hero behind the scenes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Age of Enlightenment: Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. The Encyclopédie, for example, narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes, the man in charge of the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself.

A member of the Raiderettes -- \\"Football's Fabulous Females\\" -- filed suit against the Oakland Raiders football team on Wednesday, claiming she was not paid properly. Identified in court documents only as \\"Lacy T.,\\" her allegations included unpaid work, pay below the minimum wage, no meal or rest breaks and untimely pay. Mike Taylor, director of public relations for the Raiders, has no comment when contacted Wednesday by CNN. The cheerleader claims that her pay of 1,250 for the season -- including 125 per game -- was less than 5 per hour for appearances at games, rehearsals and charity events. Raiderettes, she said, are not paid until the end of the season and have \\"fines\\" for late arrival and other infractions deducted from the paycheck.

In the lawsuit filed in Alameda County Superior Court, cheerleader Lacy T. (the team does not divulge cheerleaders’ names for security reasons) claims the team pays its cheerleaders 1,250 annually, which equates to less than 5 an hour. “It’s as if the Raiders’ owners believe that the laws that protect all workers in California just don’t apply to them,” said attorney Sharon Vinick, who is representing the cheerleader. Raiders cheerleaders -- known as Raiderettes -- are not paid until the end of the season and have to pay for expenses such as travel costs out of pocket, the lawsuit alleges. Cheerleaders can also be fined for not bringing the correct equipment to practice, such as the wrong pom-poms, according to the suit. The Raiders organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The suit is also seeking back-pay for cheerleaders from previous seasons, who have since left the squad.

Option 1: --Jennifer was angry. Reasoning: Jennifer went directly to Victoria's house to ask for a divorce, which implies she might be emotionally charged and prepared for confrontation. The fact that no one was there to respond to her request could frustrate her further. Therefore, this option seems plausible. Option 2: --Victoria was angry. Reasoning: Since there is no indication in the sentence that Victoria is aware of Jennifer's intentions or was expecting her, it's not clear why Victoria would be angry.

Holmes (Cook) has just restored a stolen artifact to three French nuns, and is later called on a case by Dr. Mortimer (Terry-Thomas) concerning Sir Henry Baskerville (Kenneth Williams) and a legendary hound that curses the Baskerville estate. Tired and worn out by so many cases, Holmes passes the case onto Dr. Watson (Moore), who is portrayed as a Welsh eccentric. Upon arriving at the station, Sir Henry, Dr. Mortimer, Watson and Perkins (their driver) are halted by a policeman (Spike Milligan), who warns them of a murderer stalking the moors, before sending the group on their way. While out in the moor collecting specimens, Watson has a curious encounter in a hut with the raving Mr. Frankland (Hugh Griffith) and Frankland's exceedingly strong daughter, Mary (Dana Gillespie ). In the next scene, we see Holmes still in London, visiting Ada, his mother (also played by Dudley Moore), who, as a bogus spiritualist aided by her housekeeper, Iris, scams older ladies of their money in false seances.

In the next scene, while wandering on the moors, Watson happens upon Mr. Stapleton (Denholm Elliott), who mistakes him for Sir Henry. Stapleton's sister (Joan Greenwood) describes dramatically her encounter with the Hound on the moor, suggesting that it ravished her, whereupon she attempts to force herself upon the reluctant Watson, with Miss Stapleton undergoing supernatural transformations reminiscent of The Exorcist.

In the first quarter, Minnesota got on the board with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 3-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. It was originally ruled an incomplete pass as Shiancoe stepped out of bounds, but Minnesota challenged and won based on the fact that Shiancoe had both feet in bounds and the referee counted Shiancoe's third step, thereby making the original ruling on the field to be overturned. The Cardinals then responded with quarterback Kurt Warner finding wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 2-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, Arizona took the lead with Warner finding Boldin again on a 39-yard TD pass. The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 25-yard field goal.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Individuals with a history of being physically or emotionally abused, especially as children, are more prone to suffer from IED, as are those suffering from a personality disorder or other serious mental illnesses. IED may also be linked with repeated traumatic experiences of violence or stress, such as the traumas experienced by active-duty military personnel. Other mental illnesses are sometimes linked to IED include personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and disorders associated with disruptive behavior, such as attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Just because an individual displays one or more of these risk factors does not mean they suffer from IED. However, the presence of risk factors in addition to the characteristic symptoms of IED, explosive episodes of rage, should be cause for concern. Everyone finds themselves feeling or expressing anger from time to time, and it's perfectly healthy to do so. Rage, on the other hand, is a destructive emotion that can cause us to act in ways we normally would never think to. While anger may influence the way we behave while experiencing it, rage seems to utterly command our behavior and thought, leaving no room for anything else. Explosive episodes seem to come out of nowhere. An IED sufferer may find themselves in a steady, or even pleasant mood, conducting their daily business when, without warning, they find themselves overwhelmingly angry, displaying uncontrollable, violent behavior. While explosive episodes are most likely to occur in private, often after dark, their unpredictable nature means that they may sometimes occur in places where loud or highly visible expressions of anger are inappropriate, such as at work or in public places. Sufferers of IED often become extremely violent, or even abusive, during their explosive episodes. Seemingly tiny arguments or frustrations can lead, in the blink of an eye, to extraordinary and uncharacteristic displays of physical and emotional cruelty. These displays are usually very sudden in their onset, making them unpredictable and dangerous for everyone involved. Common examples of violent behaviors linked to IED include: Shouting or screaming, even though the person being spoken to is not raising their voice. Invading personal space, often by stepping close and getting \\"in the face\\" of those nearby. Throwing, hitting, or breaking objects. Shoving, grabbing, or hitting others. Intentionally hurting oneself, such as by slapping or punching, beating one's head against a wall, etc. Name-calling, or use of language intended to hurt or insult others. Threatening others with violence. While the specific behaviors displayed by an IED sufferer during an explosive episode may vary, they are always characterized by being disproportionate, or \\"way over the top\\", relative to the circumstances or events triggering the episode. A true explosive episode can last for several hours before it dissipates naturally. After an extended episode of rage, the sufferer is likely to feel exhausted, and relieved that the episode has ended. Later, the sufferer may feel intense remorse, shame, and unease while thinking about the things they said and did while experiencing their explosive episode. These feelings can lead the sufferer to become depressed, irritable and removed An IED sufferer will also often experience much shorter episodes, during which they might momentarily \\"snap\\" at someone in conversation, becoming suddenly verbally or physically hostile before returning to normal. Episodes occur irregularly, with gaps of days, weeks or even months in between. Only a medical expert can diagnose someone with IED, or any other mental illness. Your first step, if you suspect that you or someone you know is suffering from IED, should be to consult with a psychiatrist, councilor or medical doctor about the symptoms and risk factors which are bothering you. Once any anger issues have been diagnosed, you and your doctor can begin exploring options for treatment.","completion":"The article discusses the causes, symptoms, and potential treatments of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), a mental health condition characterized by explosive episodes of rage, which may be linked to past trauma, other mental illnesses, and can have serious consequences for the individual and their relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. - The Galactic Center is the rotational center of the Milky Way. The estimates for its location range from 7.6 to 8.7 kiloparsecs (about 25,000 to 28,000 lightyears) from Earth in the direction of the constellations Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, and Scorpius where the Milky Way appears brightest. There is strong evidence consistent with the existence of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. - WR 102ka , also known as the Peony star , is a Wolf - Rayet star that is one of several candidates for the most luminous known star in the Milky Way . An even more luminous yet closer star , WR 25 , appears to be most likely to the title . Another nearer star Eta Carinae , which was the second brightest star in the sky for a few years in the 19th century , appears to be slightly more luminous than WR 102ka , but is known to be a binary star system . There is also the more recently discovered Pistol star that , like the Peony star , derives its name from the shape of the nebula in which it is embedded , and which it has probably created through heavy mass loss via fierce stellar winds and perhaps also major \`\` mini-supernova - like '' eruptions as happened to Eta Carinae around the 1830s - 1840s creating the lobes observed by the Hubble Space Telescope . The luminosities of the Pistol Star , Eta Carinae , and WR 102ka are all rendered somewhat uncertain due to heavy obscuration by galactic dust in the foreground , the effects of which must be corrected for before their apparent brightness can be reduced to estimate their total radiated power or bolometric luminosity . Both Eta Carinae and WR 102ka are believed likely to explode as supernovas or hypernovas within the next few million years . As is typical of such extremely massive and luminous stars , both have expelled a considerable portion of their initial mass , when originally formed , in dense , massive stellar winds . As WR 102ka lies near the Galactic Center , it is the more distant and heavily obscured of the two , and is essentially totally obscured in visible wavelengths . Thus it must be observed in longer wavelength infrared light , which is able to penetrate the dust . The Spitzer Space Telescope observed WR 102ka at wavelengths of 3.6 µm , 8 µm , and 24 µm on April 20 , 2005 . The observations were carried out by L. Oskinova , W. - R. Hamann , and A. Barniske of Potsdam University , Germany . WR 102ka was previously observed by the Two Micron All... - Eta Carinae (abbreviated to Carinae or Car), formerly known as Eta Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity over five million times that of the Sun, located around 7500 light-years (2300 parsecs) distant in the constellation Carina. First recorded as a 4th-magnitude star, it brightened considerably over the period 1837 to 1856 in an event known as the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae became the second-brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, peaking above magnitude 4.5 in 2014. Eta Carinae is circumpolar south of latitude 30°S, so it is never visible north of latitude 30°N. - The Pistol Star is a blue hypergiant star, one of the most luminous known in the Milky Way. It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates. It is located approximately 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light. - The Pistol Nebula is located in the constellation Sagittarius. It surrounds one of the most luminous stars known, the Pistol Star. Both are located 25,000 light years away from Earth in the Quintuplet cluster, near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula contains approximately 9.3 solar masses worth of ionized gas that was ejected by the star several thousand years ago. The nebula was named in the 1980s for its shape as seen in low resolution images that were available at the time. The Pistol Star, a luminous blue variable is 1.6 million times brighter than the Sun making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes). Objects below approximately will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss.

A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima. Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him.

The answer to the question: Who is a former real estate developer? is inside the article: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive., can you guess it ?

Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it indicates a negative perception of the movie. The step-by-step justifications for this inference are as follows: 1. First, the structure of the statement is examined. The phrase \\"even the funniest idea isn't funny\\" seemingly works to convey disappointment or dissatisfaction. 2. The use of negative phrasing such as \\"isn't funny\\" indicates that the reviewer doesn't consider various aspects of the movie, supposedly meant to be humorous, to be effective in their delivery. 3. The use of \\"even\\", a word often used to express an extreme case or an unexpected outcome, suggests that parts of the movie that should have ordinarily been successful (the \\"funniest\\" parts) were not perceived as being funny. 4. All these points lead to the conclusion that the reviewer did not view the movie positively overall. The sentence under analysis doesn't contain any positive feedback about the movie. However, it is crucial to have in mind that it's only one sentence from a possibly wider review. The overall rating could differ based on the rest of the review, but based solely on this sentence, it appears the movie was seen negatively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can put him in there when you aren't home, which will cut down on accidents in the house. It will also allow him a place to escape to when he is overwhelmed by everything or just needs to be alone. Since he will be spending significant time in his crate, you need to make sure you buy one large enough for your puppy. His crate, also known as a kennel, should be large enough that he can stand up, turn around, and comfortably lay down in. It should also have plenty of room to fit him as he grows. When you are first crate training your dog, you need to make it a comfortable and happy place for him. Start out with the crate open in your living room or kitchen where you are. Place a blanket, small bed, or crate pad in the crate to make him want to go in. You can also toss in a treat to encourage him inside. Once you send your dog into the crate with the door open for a few times, start shutting the door while he is in there. Leave the door closed for about 10 minutes. You should not let him out if he is still whining or scratching at the door of the cage. This will show him that this behavior will get him out of the cage. Over time, you should increase the amount of time you leave your puppy in the crate. Keep increasing the time he spends in the crate until he can stay in the crate for long periods of time without whining or pawing at the door. This will vary depending on how old your puppy is. If he is under four months old, the time he needs to stay is two hours. If he is older than four months old, he needs to stay in there four hours without whining, as long as their bladders can hold it that long. Never leave a dog in a crate for longer than this, unless he stays in his crate while you are at work. Never use the crate as a punishment because he will start seeing it as a scary place.

Read this and answer the question Some researchers who study sexual orientation argue that the concept may not apply similarly to men and women. A study of sexual arousal patterns found that women, when viewing erotic films which show female-female, male-male and male-female sexual activity (oral sex or penetration), have patterns of arousal which do not match their declared sexual orientations as well as men's. That is, heterosexual and lesbian women's sexual arousal to erotic films do not differ significantly by the genders of the participants (male or female) or by the type of sexual activity (heterosexual or homosexual). On the contrary, men's sexual arousal patterns tend to be more in line with their stated orientations, with heterosexual men showing more penis arousal to female-female sexual activity and less arousal to female-male and male-male sexual stimuli, and homosexual and bisexual men being more aroused by films depicting male-male intercourse and less aroused by other stimuli. What do some researchers argue about the idea of sexual orientation?","completion":"Some researchers argue that the concept of sexual orientation may not apply similarly to men and women, as their sexual arousal patterns exhibit differences when exposed to various erotic stimuli. A study of sexual arousal patterns using erotic films with different types of sexual activity and gender combinations has shown that women's arousal patterns do not align as closely with their declared sexual orientations as men's do. For women, both heterosexual and lesbian, their sexual arousal to erotic films does not differ significantly based on the genders of the participants (male or female) or the type of sexual activity (heterosexual or homosexual). This suggests that women's sexual arousal might be less dependent on the specific gender of sexual partners or the nature of the sexual act itself. In contrast, men's sexual arousal patterns tend to align more closely with their stated sexual orientations. Heterosexual men show more arousal to female-female sexual activity and less arousal to female-male and male-male sexual stimuli, while homosexual and bisexual men are more aroused by films depicting male-male intercourse and less aroused by other stimuli. In essence, researchers argue that the concept of sexual orientation may not be universally applicable or consistent across genders, as men and women exhibit different patterns of sexual arousal in response to various erotic stimuli. This could potentially challenge traditional understandings of sexual orientation as a binary and fixed concept, suggesting that it may be a more complex and nuanced phenomenon that varies between individuals and across genders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two men rappel down to retrieve the fallen hound, but they are killed. The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate where he finds his teammates dead and is killed by an unseen creature. Dr. Robert Verne (Robert Foxworth) is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements, where he feels he isn't making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \\"Opies\\" (i.e., \\"O.P.s\\"), the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie (Talia Shire) accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant, but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he against having children. When flying in, they meet Travis Nelson (Burke Byrnes) and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet paper mill director Bethel Isely (Richard A. Dysart), who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at Opies.

As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies who refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks (Armand Assante) and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies.

Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

However, I will discuss various factors that could influence the rating of this review and suggest possible ratings based on different criteria. 1. Length and depth of the review: If we consider the length and depth of a review to be important factors, then the review \\"Awesome\\" would likely be rated less favorably. The review consists of only one word, which, although positive in nature, does not provide any specific information or feedback about the product or service. In this case, we might rate the review at a 2 or a 3 out of 5. 2. Clarity and simplicity: On the other hand, if we value reviews that are clear and straightforward, \\"Awesome\\" certainly fulfills this criteria. The word \\"awesome\\" clearly communicates a positive experience, with no room for ambiguity. For those who prefer concise reviews with a clear sentiment, this review could be rated as a 4 or a 5 out of 5. 3. Usefulness for other consumers: To determine the usefulness of a review, we must consider how the review could potentially help or inform other consumers considering the product or service. In this context, the review \\"Awesome\\" offers limited information. While it conveys a positive experience, it does not provide any details or reasons for its satisfaction, making it difficult for other consumers to fully understand the reasons behind the reviewer's opinion. In this case, the rating could be closer to a 1 or a 2 out of 5. 4. Emotional impact: If we consider that reviews may motivate potential customers to try a product or service based on the emotional impact of the reviewer's experience, then \\"Awesome\\" can be seen as a highly positive, albeit simple, expression of satisfaction. This emotional impact could sway some potential customers toward trying the product or service. In this case, we might rate the review as a 3 to 4 out of 5. In conclusion, the rating of review would depend on which criteria we choose to prioritize. If we prioritize length and depth, or usefulness for other consumers, the review \\"Awesome\\" would receive a lower rating. However, if we prioritize clarity and simplicity or emotional impact, this review might be rated more favorably. It is important to note that more specific information about the product or service and reviewer's experience should be provided for a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the review's quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stevie McMullen, 31, was being taken to court alongside Ryan MacDonald, 20, when three masked men armed with guns attacked the GEOAmey prison transport vehicle in Salford on Tuesday. Police caught McMullen this afternoon, travelling in a car with two other men on the A6, near Lancaster University, Greater Manchester Police said. ‘Dangerous’ MacDonald is still at large and there is a £10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. At the time of the escape, McMullen. was due to appear on trial for conspiracies to kidnap, rob, commit arson. and possess a firearm. He has now been arrested on suspicion of escaping from lawful custody. The other two men, aged 27 and 25,. were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They have been. taken into police custody for questioning. Assistant Chief Constable Steve. Heywood said: ‘Since two prisoners were sprung from a GEOAmey prison van. on Tuesday, our officers have been working round-the-clock to trace. these fugitives and bring them back into custody. ‘This afternoon, we have arrested a. 31-year-old man in the Lancashire area as part of this operation, but. our efforts will continue to trace 20-year-old Ryan MacDonald, who is. still wanted by police.' ‘On Friday, a £10,000 reward was put. forward for information leading to the capture of these two men. This. full £10,000 reward still stands for anyone who gives us information. that leads to MacDonald's arrest and will be paid when he is back behind. bars. Investigation: The GEOAmey prison van was on Regent Road with its side door open and glass all over the road. Looking: A police officer stands guard at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van in Salford. Probe: A forensic officer retrieves evidence at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van. ‘I would ask members of the public not. to approach this man due to the potential danger he poses, but if you. see him then please call the police immediately. ‘We continue to follow up on a number. of leads but I would also like to offer MacDonald the opportunity to. hand himself in, which he can do either by calling police himself, or by. contacting a trusted family member, friend or his solicitor.’ Still at large: Ryan MacDonald, 20, who has now been sentenced in his absence, is still on the run. Shortly after 9am on Tuesday, a prison. van carrying prisoners from HMP Altcourse to Manchester Crown Square. was attacked on Regent Road, Salford, by at least three men wearing dark. clothing and balaclavas. The men had arrived at the location in a dark coloured Saab and threatened staff transporting the prisoners with a shotgun. Five men - believed to be three. offenders and the two escaped prisoners - then got back into the Saab,. which was driven a short distance and abandoned. It is believed three ran towards a nearby estate and two may have further escaped on a motorbike that was later found abandoned. On Tuesday, April 30 a 28-year-old. woman and 24-year-old man were detained at a house on the Ordsall. estate, Salford on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender. They have been released on bail pending further inquiries until June. 26. MacDonald was due to be sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle taking when he escaped. His delayed hearing was held on Friday at Manchester Crown Court as he was jailed for seven years and 10 months. The 20-year-old defendant had pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing. MacDonald was part of a gang who. targeted pawnbrokers in Manchester and Salford where jewellery was. stolen in daylight smash-and-grab raids. Dangerous: Police warn that 20-year-old Ryan McDonald, of Salford, is still at large and should not be approached. Response: Two inmates escaped after a prison van was attacked on a road in Salford, Greater Manchester. Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan. said on Friday: ‘It is unfortunate that MacDonald wasn't present today. to see this sentence being passed down but we will track him down and. find him to ensure that he does get his day in the dock. ‘The offences for which he has been. sentenced today only underline just how dangerous he is. So I would like. to continue my plea to anyone who has information on his whereabouts to. call us. ‘This man has no place on our streets. and will not be allowed to undermine the work we have done in Salford to. help make people feel safe. ‘Anyone who sees MacDonald is not to approach him but call the police.’ Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5237, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or, in an emergency, call 999.

Passage:On December 8, 2017, the Phoenix Suns signed House to a two-way contract with the team. Throughout the rest of the season, House would split his playing time there between Phoenix and their NBA G League squad, the Northern Arizona Suns. House would make his debut with the team a day later, scoring two points and recording a single rebound in 11 minutes of play in a close loss against the San Antonio Spurs. On December 16, House would score a season-high 8 points in 15 minutes of playing time in a 108–106 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. House was later assigned to the Northern Arizona Suns affiliate alongside Davon Reed on December 28, mainly for healing purposes. House then returned to action on January 5, 2018, recording what was at the time a new season-high 9 points in a loss against the San Antonio Spurs. On February 23, his two-way contract expired, meaning he couldn't be allowed to play for Phoenix again until after the NBA G League's first season under its rebranded name concluded. Once that happened, he was allowed to return to Phoenix for the rest of the season. On March 30, House recorded a career-high 8 rebounds in a heartbreaking, buzzer-beating loss against the Houston Rockets. On April 1, House would record a new season-high with 16 points scored alongside 6 rebounds and 3 assists in a 117–107 loss against the Golden State Warriors. Two days later, House recorded 14 points, 6 rebounds, and a career-high 5 assists in a 97–94 win against the Sacramento Kings. On April 6, House would put up his first start in the NBA against the New Orleans Pelicans. Two days later, House would record career-highs of 22 points and 8 rebounds in a 117–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors. Solution:","completion":"b"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"Besides the Stovl what is another aircraft mentioned in the paragraph?\\" is in \\"Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\".

Continue the following story. Tanya determined that the couch made the deep scratches, and not the chair, because the OPT: a). couch is lighter.. b). chair is lighter..","completion":"c). couch had sharp edges hidden beneath its frame. Tanya never imagined her cozy living room would turn into a crime scene of sorts. She had always taken pride in her sense of style and taste. The lush white carpet, the elegant gray couch and the charming wooden chair had been her carefully chosen ensemble. Now, she stared at the deep scratches on the pristine carpet, her heart sinking. Somehow, someway, the couch was the culprit. As she examined the jagged lines, she recalled her initial hypothesis about the chair being the offender. It had an antique design with intricately carved wooden legs. Yet, its soft, velvety cushions concealed its true nature, as Tanya discovered that the chair was significantly lighter. The sheer effort necessary to create such deep, menacing scratches on the carpet indicated that the more robust couch was likely responsible. Moreover, a closer inspection of both the couch and the chair revealed their construction. The chair was indeed old, but the wood was properly sanded, polished, and lacked any uneven or sharp surfaces. On the other hand, the couch had a heavier metal frame hidden beneath its chic gray upholstery. Its modern looks and plump cushions had instantly drawn her to the piece, but little did she know, lurking beneath the frame were sharp, metal edges. She couldn't help but wonder how she had overlooked such an alarming detail. The memories of her shopping excursions came flooding back, reminding her of the day she had brought the couch home. The hurried deliverymen had carelessly dragged the couch into the living room, paying no heed to the damage they were inflicting on the delicate carpet. At the time, she had been entirely focused on rearranging her living space, her excitement building as she planned the room's layout. Tanya couldn't recall paying much attention to the bottom of the couch, so enamored by its beautiful exterior. Now faced with the daunting task of repairing both the couch and the damage it had caused, her initial enthusiasm was replaced by a surge of frustration and regret. Determined to rectify her mistakes, Tanya began her search for a professional furniture repair service. She knew the couch's sharp edges had to be addressed before the damage spiraled further out of control. As for the carpet, she scanned through a series of online tutorials, contemplating whether she should fix it herself or opt for professional help. She came to the conclusion that the scale of the scratches was beyond her expertise, and so, reluctantly, added carpet repair to her growing list of things to do. Meanwhile, she couldn't help but think about her response to the entire ordeal. A part of her felt angry at the negligence of the manufacturers; they had done an inadequate job of sealing the couch's dangerous edges. On the other hand, she also felt responsible for overlooking such a crucial detail. In retrospect, her hasty decisions and neglect of thorough investigations had played a significant role in this debacle. As the days turned into weeks, Tanya proceeded to resolve the damages inflicted on her beloved living room. Lessons were learned, and she realized how important it is to pay attention to even the smallest of details. By the time the couch and carpet were restored to their former glory, Tanya vowed that in the future, she would not fall prey to superficial appearances. With this newfound wisdom, she continued to grow and evolve, cherishing her stylish living room which now held not only elegance but also a valuable life lesson."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The answer is: Miriam. The first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government is Miriam Makeba."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Staying in our apartment on the North Shore of Vancouver, we were tucked into a sleepy, suburban idyll where once off the busy highway, kids played ball games in the street and cats strolled around their own home territories without a care in the world. It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.) Watching the shower of golden pine needles drift down from the redwoods whilst I typed out a blog post, I enjoyed seeing squirrels scamper and birds twitter their way around the boughs and branches. That blur below? A local black squirrel who was foraging amongst the cooing tourists for snacks… About 20 minutes later his grinning face floated back into view, and he brandished his phone with images of his quick wander through the trails. Lynn Canyon Park officially opened to the public in 1912; there are several trails throughout the park to choose from for a leisurely hike including the popular Baden Powell Trail and there are also many breathtaking waterfalls and popular swimming holes which are perfect during the summer months.

It can be a starting point for collaboration, inviting others to join in the process of generating new and innovative approaches. In the context of a conversation, you could use \\"Vymyslíme něco\\" to initiate a creative and imaginative discussion, or to encourage others to think outside the box. Czech and English share some similarities, as they both belong to the Indo-European language family, which is a large group of languages spoken in many parts of the world. However, Czech is a Slavic language, while English is a Germanic language, so they have some significant differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. One of the interesting aspects of Czech is its rich system of inflections, which involve changing the form of a word to express its grammatical function in a sentence, such as its case, number, or gender. This process can be seen in the phrase \\"Vymyslíme něco,\\" where the verb \\"vymyslíme\\" is conjugated in the first-person plural form, meaning \\"we come up with.\\" On the other hand, English relies more on word order and auxiliary words to communicate grammatical information. In the English translation \\"Let's think of something,\\" \\"let's\\" is a contraction of \\"let us,\\" which is used to create a first-person plural imperative form, showing that the speaker is including themselves and their interlocutors in the action. Additionally, the preposition \\"of\\" is used to express the relationship between the verb \\"think\\" and the object \\"something.\\" Overall, \\"Vymyslíme něco\\" is a versatile and inclusive phrase that can be used to inspire creativity and collaboration between individuals who want to work together to achieve a common goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Farmers in Nebraska, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New York are staging something of a mechanical revolt. They're attempting to get legislation passed in their states that would enable them, for the first time since the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to repair their own tractors or get an independent mechanic to help. At the root of the morass is the software that helps run modern tractors and their sensors, diagnostic tools, and other high-tech elements. If farmers so much as open the metaphorical hood to check out the computers they could be violating the federal act, reports Modern Farmer. Mick Minchow, a Nebraska farmer for more than 40 years, is among the many who are fed up, reports Lincoln Journal Star. As it currently stands, any problem with his John Deere 8235 R requires a trip to the dealer and costs him important time. What he'd like to be able to do, per the paper, is something as simple as looking up the system code to determine if it's a serious problem or something as mundane as replacing a filter. John Deere's argument, as reported by Wired, is that giving farmers free rein over the software would \\"make it possible for pirates, third-party developers, and less innovative competitors to free-ride off the creativity, unique expression, and ingenuity of vehicle software.\\" Other potential issues that have been floated: the financial hit such a change could wreak on dealerships, and the complications of buying used equipment whose software was improperly changed. (This copyright dispute involved a bustle in your hedgerow.) Article:","completion":"Title: Mechanical Revolt: Farmers Fight for the Right to Repair Their Own Tractors Introduction Farmers in Nebraska, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New York are taking a stand against what they perceive as unreasonable restrictions on their ability to repair their own tractors, or to enlist the help of an independent mechanic. They are advocating for the passage of legislation in their states that would allow them to do so without violating the stipulations of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Central to this growing discontent is the increasingly complicated software, sensors, and high-tech aspects of modern tractors, which currently can only be legally repaired and maintained by authorized dealers. The Issue In-Depth Mick Minchow, a Nebraska farmer with over 40 years of experience, is among the many who have grown frustrated with these restrictive provisions, as reported by the Lincoln Journal Star. As it currently stands, any problem with his John Deere 8235 R requires a costly and time-consuming trip to the dealership for repair or maintenance. Minchow and other farmers argue that they should be able to carry out simple tasks such as looking up system codes to determine the severity of a problem, or performing routine maintenance like replacing a filter, without running afoul of the federal act. Manufacturers, such as John Deere, have countered this argument, stating that giving farmers unrestricted access to the software would create opportunities for piracy, unauthorized third-party development, and potentially allow less innovative competitors to exploit the technology, according to Wired magazine. Additionally, they argue that any changes to the current system could have a negative financial impact on dealerships, as well as complicating the buying and selling of used equipment whose software may have been improperly altered. These concerns frame the debate as not only a matter of inconvenience for the farmers but also a potential threat to the industry as a whole. The Role of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act At the heart of the issue is the DMCA, a set of laws passed in 1998 that sought to protect copyrighted digital content, including the software that runs modern tractors and their various high-tech components. Under the DMCA, any unauthorized tampering with, or circumventing of, the protections built into this software would constitute a violation of federal law. This bars farmers from diagnosing, repairing, or maintaining their equipment without the assistance of authorized dealers, even if the issue at hand is a simple and mundane fix. The Fight for Change In response to this perceived injustice, farmers in the aforementioned states are pushing for the passage of \\"right to repair\\" legislation, which would grant them greater control over their equipment and enable them to carry out basic maintenance tasks independently or with the help of an independent mechanic. This legislative effort is the latest chapter in an ongoing campaign for greater technological autonomy, which has seen similar battles fought over the repair of smartphones and other consumer electronics. Conclusion It remains to be seen whether these legislative efforts will ultimately succeed in granting farmers the right to repair their own tractors and other agricultural equipment. It is clear, however, that the growth of software-driven technology in many industries, not just agriculture, raises important questions about the balance between protecting intellectual property and granting consumers' greater autonomy and choice in how they maintain and repair their possessions. The \\"mechanical revolt\\" of the nation's farmers may serve as an important catalyst in helping to shape the conversation around these critical issues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Five men accused of the brutal gang rape and murder of a trainee physiotherapist in Delhi have pleaded not guilty in a case that has already prompted the reform of India's sex crime laws. The accused, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Kumar and brothers Ram and Mukesh Singh, signed statements in the new fast-track court, set up after the killing on 16 December, declaring they were innocent, said one of the men's lawyers. The court will begin hearing the evidence of witnesses on Tuesday. The five men could face the death sentence if convicted. A sixth accused, believed to be 17 years old, will be tried in a juvenile court and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility. Police say the victim and a male friend were heading home from an evening movie when they boarded the bus. The attackers beat the man and raped the woman, causing her serious internal injuries with a metal bar. The victims were eventually dumped on the roadside, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. \\"After the judge read out the charges, the five pleaded not guilty and walked out,\\" AP Singh, a lawyer defending Sharma and Thakur told Reuters. The prosecution says it has strong evidence against the five men including bloodstained clothing, DNA matches, mobile phone records, confessions and eyewitness statements. Singh says Sharma was never on the bus and Thakur was hiding beneath a seat and never took part in the crime. The other men are represented by two other lawyers. ||||| A fast-track court here today framed charges against five accused in the December 16 gangrape case and put them on trial on various counts including conspiracy to abduct the 23-year-old girl and sexually assault and murder her. A fresh offence under section 366 of the Indian Penal Code was added by the court against them for abducting the girl with the intention to compel and force her to 'illicit intercourse'. The court, which fixed February 5 for starting the trial, also charged them with murder of the paramedic girl under section 302 (murder) of the IPC which entails the maximum punishment of death penalty. Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna concluded that there were facts prima facie to suggest that the accused, along with another juvenile associate, conspired to deceitfully induce the girl and her male friend to board the vehicle believing it to be a chartered bus for raping the victim and committing other offences. The accused bus driver Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The sixth accused, which the police in the charge sheet claimed to be most brutal among them, has been declared 'minor' by the Juvenile Justice Board, which will try him. However, the fast track court in the order described the juvenile as an 'associate' of the five accused, who committed gang rape in furtherance of the conspiracy and 'in furtherance of common intention'. The girl had died in a hospital in Singapore on December 29 last year. The court has farmed charges under section 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 376 (2)(g) (gangrape), 377 (unnatural offences), 395 (dacoity), 396 (murder in dacoity), 201 (destruction of evidence), 120-B (conspiracy), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 365 ( kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), and 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity) of the IPC.

In these two sentences (1) Before laying sod on that clay, the ground needs two inches of coverage with topsoil. (2) Don't go to lunch if we don't have enough coverage for the help-desk phones., does the word coverage mean the same thing?","completion":"No, the word \\"coverage\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. Although they share the same word – coverage – the context and meaning are different in each scenario. Let's analyze both sentences to better understand the distinct meanings of \\"coverage\\" within these statements. 1. Before laying sod on that clay, the ground needs two inches of coverage with topsoil. In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the physical application of a layer of material (in this case, topsoil) over a surface (the clay ground). The context suggests that it is necessary to place a two-inch layer of topsoil on the clay ground before laying the sod. This will ensure that the sod has a suitable base for proper growth and establishment. The underlying idea is that topsoil, with its higher nutrient content and better drainage, will lead to a healthier and more efficient growth of the sod compared to clay soil. 2. Don't go to lunch if we don't have enough coverage for the help-desk phones. In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the availability of sufficient personnel to handle the incoming calls and successfully address customers' issues at the help-desk. The context is related to staffing and resource allocation, where ensuring that there are enough people to handle the workload is critical for providing good customer service. The sentence implies that if there are not enough people to cover the help-desk phones, the person in question should not go to lunch, as it would potentially lead to longer wait times for customers and a negative experience. In this context, \\"coverage\\" deals with people's presence and time to guarantee smooth operation. In conclusion, while both sentences use the word \\"coverage,\\" they refer to different concepts depending on the context. In the first sentence, \\"coverage\\" relates to the application of a material (topsoil) over another surface (clay ground), while in the second sentence, \\"coverage\\" is about ensuring adequate personnel availability to handle customer service responsibilities."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter. Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House.

At 10:18 when the Vice President called him, President George W. Bush was aboard Air Force One. On the morning of September 11, 2001, President Bush had been visiting Emma E.

The groups most affected by so-called voter suppression tend to vote Democrat. But it is not just Democrats who are opposed to the collection of such data by the federal government.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Air India says being grossly overweight does have a bearing on reflexes and can impair agility India's national carrier Air India is set to ground 125 \\"overweight\\" cabin crew members. An Air India official told the BBC that the order had been made on the basis of a document issued by the civil aviation authority last year. The airline had warned 600 of its crew to \\"shape up\\" last year, but 125 had not managed to maintain the required weight, the official said. The airline says however that the issue is not one of weight, but \\"fitness\\". Airline officials confirmed to the BBC that the directive had been issued, but said it was part of an internal document which they could not comment on publicly. They said the basis for the recommendation was concern that \\"unfit\\" cabin crew would not be able to operate efficiently in emergency situations. Aviation regulations state that a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-25 is normal for a male cabin crew member, while for a female it is 18-22. Aviation expert Kapil Kaul told the BBC: \\"An overweight crew is a signal the airline is not fit. You need a smart friendly agile crew that can complement the image of the airline.\\" However, national union leader Tapan Sen denied that service rules mention any firm weight restriction for cabin crew. This is not the first time Air India has grounded staff over weight issues. In 2009, it dismissed nine hostesses for being \\"overweight\\" on safety grounds saying their shape could \\"impair agility\\". In 2004, the airline landed itself in further controversy when it said that potential air hostesses and stewards should not have any scars, acne, or any major marks on the face. ||||| Air India last year warned 600 of its 3,500 cabin crew to lose weight within six months or risk being taken off flights and given a job on the ground. The airline now plans to remove about 130 from cabin crew duty because their body mass index (BMI) levels remain above the prescribed limit. The airline said that the “normal” BMI for an air hostess is between 18 and 22, “overweight” between 22 and 27, and “obese” for a value above 27. For male attendants the brackets were 18 to 25, 25 to 30, and above. The NHS says a “healthy” BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. After the state-run airline’s staff were tested last year, the 600 found to be “overweight” or “obese” were declared “temporarily unfit” for flight duties and asked to undergo clinical examinations and lose weight by changing their diet and lifestyle and exercising more, while being monitored by staff. “About 130 of them failed the reassessment,” an Air India official told The Telegraph in Calcutta. “We are now declaring them permanently unfit for their job as flight attendants.” “People who are fitter can respond quicker and more efficiently in case of any untoward situation.” This is not the first time Air India has removed staff from the air for being overweight. In 2009, the airline ground 10 flight attendants who failed to slim down. In 2013, Air India said that deploying female flight attendants rather than male could save them about £329,000 per year in full costs because they weight on average 33 to 44 pounds lighter. A member of the All India Cabin Crew Association said the grounding of 130 staff was “ridiculous”, according to The Telegraph. “Any industry insider would vouch that Air India flight attendants are the best, mainly because of their long experience. So, this guideline and the management's decision to follow it to the letter is unacceptable.” The airline has had a difficult year, with a special recruitment day in March welcoming zero attendees. It has also suffered from financial difficulties in recent years, with a government bailout necessary to keep the carrier afloat in 2012. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Air India is set to ground 125 \\"overweight\\" cabin crew members, citing fitness concerns that may affect their ability to operate efficiently in emergency situations.

Text: Waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given text, it is stated that \\"waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy.\\" Consequently, if Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the energy carried by that soundwave will decrease. To provide more context, it is essential to understand the relationship between the wavelength, frequency, and energy of a wave. The energy of a wave is directly proportional to its frequency and indirectly proportional to its wavelength. In simpler terms, as the wavelength of a wave increases, the frequency and the energy decrease. Similarly, as the wavelength decreases, the frequency and energy increase. Sound waves, like other types of waves, obey this principle. Since Jimbo is increasing the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the frequency of the soundwave will decrease, resulting in a reduction in energy carried by that soundwave. This outcome is in accordance with the given statement that \\"waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy.\\" In summary, when Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the energy carried by that soundwave will decrease. This is due to the inverse relationship between wavelength and energy, where longer wavelengths correspond to lower energy, while shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Snowboard Cross and Ski Cross Have Long History With Danger WEST VANCOUVER, British Columbia  Four at a time, the racers barrel down the mountain, navigating banked turns, long jumps, washboard bumps and  if they can help it  one another. The concept is simple: first one to the bottom wins. Join the discussion with news, analysis and features from the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone, via Associated Press Danielle Poleschuk of Canda, right, and Katrin Ofner of Austria at a World Cup ski cross event last month. Ski cross is making its Olympic debut. There are times that no one makes it to the finish line without a tumble. And it is not unusual for some racers to never make it at all. “Yeah, we’ve had a lot of injuries, a lot of serious ones, a couple deaths in our sport,” said the American snowboard cross athlete Nate Holland, a gold medal contender. “It’s no joke.” A luger from the Republic of Georgia was killed in a crash on Friday, setting a somber tone for the Vancouver Games and stirring debate over how much is too much risk. Despite its high speeds through an icy chute, luge has had relatively few serious injuries since it was added to the Olympic program in 1964. Death in the sport is rare. But snowboard cross and its cousin, ski cross, the only new medal sport added for these Olympics, are probably the most dangerous sports at the Winter Games. Weeks after finishing 12th at the 2006 Turin Games, the Olympic debut for snowboard cross, Jonatan Johansson of Sweden died of internal injuries after a hard landing on a World Cup course in Lake Placid, N.Y. About 18 months before, Line Ostvold of Norway, a former world champion enticed out of retirement by the addition of snowboard cross to the Olympic roster, died of a head injury after a spill on a World Cup course in Chile. Still, the spectacle of snowboard cross was appealing enough that the International Olympic Committee added ski cross to the winter program in November 2006. Somewhat predictably, its debut next Sunday could be substantially depleted because of injuries in recent weeks. The former American Alpine skiing Olympians Daron Rahlves, 36, and Casey Puckett, 37, found that they missed the thrill of hurtling down a steep mountain after retiring. Having re-emerged as medal contenders in ski cross, each was hurt at the Winter X Games days after being named to the Olympic team. Their status for the Olympics is uncertain; Rahlves said it could be a last-minute decision, and Puckett tentatively plans to compete. The same is true for the Austrian snowboard cross favorite Max Schairer, the defending World Cup champion, who was released from a hospital Jan. 31, a day after sustaining a concussion and breaking ribs in a fall. At training last week, Yuka Fujimori of Japan, who was seventh in women’s snowboard cross at the 2006 Olympics, sustained neck and hip injuries and was hospitalized. And last year, three weeks after winning the bronze at the Winter X Games, the Norwegian snowboarder Stian Sivertzen crashed on the course that will be used for these Olympics, fracturing his collarbone, pelvis and lower back, and tearing his aorta. He later went into a coma but has recovered to reach the Olympics. The skiers and riders in the cross sports, which will take place on the same course at Cypress Mountain, realize danger has an allure not just for fans, but for themselves. The American snowboard cross athlete Graham Watanabe, whose injury history includes a severely injured knee and  in a separate crash  a pelvis broken in four places, said he was proud to make the Olympics largely because of the injuries he had overcome. “I try to put myself in positions where I come up to a jump and say, ‘This thing scares me to death right now,’ ” Watanabe said. “But if I conquer this one, the next one’s going to be easier.” The course at Cypress Mountain drops with an 18 percent grade over about two-thirds of a mile, or 1,100 meters. Athletes will jockey for position near the top, then snake around turns, over blind mounds and, airborne, across wide gaps, looking for places to pass. While the snowboard cross and ski cross are often compared to roller derby, intentional contact is not permitted. It is much more graceful than that. “There really is no feeling in the world like soaring through the air with other guys right next to you,” said Holland, who has won the Winter X Games five consecutive times, but was 14th in Turin after a fall and feels he has some unfinished Olympic business. “It’s really loud, before the lip, with all the boards on the snow. And then it’s just silent in the air. Then you hear pop-pop-pop-pop  all the landings. All your senses are perked, for sure.” But things can fall apart in a hurry. Puckett, a four-time Olympian in Alpine skiing, was leading a World Cup ski cross race in Grindelwald, Switzerland, two years ago. One of the four competitors had already fallen before a second lost his balance over a jump and, in midair, knocked out a third, who skidded out of control and upended Puckett, sending him cartwheeling down the mountain. The chain reaction sent Puckett to a hospital in a helicopter with a serious shoulder injury. The injury he had in January did not come about the same way. Leading near the finish, he crashed into a gate on his own. This time, it was his other shoulder that was hurt. The most famous race in snowboard cross probably came at the 2006 Olympics and it was not the American Seth Wescott’s gold medal run, which capped a day of chaos and carnage. It was the women’s final. Canada’s Maelle Ricker, a medal favorite again this Olympics, fell so hard that she was airlifted to a hospital. Dominique Maltais of Canada collided with a competitor and flew off the course and into the safety netting. And the American Lindsey Jacobellis was cruising to victory until the last jump when, comfortably ahead, she coolly grabbed her board, lost her balance in the air and tumbled to the snow. Tanja Frieden of Switzerland, who had been far behind after her brush with Maltais, breezed past for the victory. Jacobellis was left with one of the Winter Games’ most famous silver medals. Her quest for gold this time around is a major story line. Most telling might be what occurred in late January. Frieden retired from the snowboard cross after tearing her Achilles’ tendons in a crash. Crying, she made the announcement from a wheelchair.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.

Mihail Sadoveanu (Romanian: [miha'il sado'veanu]; occasionally referred to as Mihai Sadoveanu; November 5, 1880 - October 19, 1961) was a Romanian novelist, short story writer, journalist and political figure, who twice served as acting head of state for the communist republic (1947-1948 and 1958). One of the most prolific Romanian-language writers, he is remembered mostly for his historical and adventure novels, as well as for his nature writing. An author whose career spanned five decades, Sadoveanu was an early associate of the traditionalist magazine Samanatorul, before becoming known as a Realist writer and an adherent to the Poporanist current represented by Viata Romaneasca journal. His books, critically acclaimed for their vision of age-old solitude and natural abundance, are generally set in the historical region of Moldavia, building on themes from Romania's medieval and early modern history. In 1896, when he was aged sixteen, Sadoveanu gave thought to writing a monograph on Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, but his first literary attempts date from the following year. It was in 1897 that a sketch story, titled Domnisoara M din Falticeni (\\"Miss M from Falticeni\\") and signed Mihai din Pascani (\\"Mihai from Pascani\\"), was successfully submitted for publishing to the Bucharest-based satirical magazine Dracu. He started writing for Ovid Densusianu's journal Vieata Noua in 1898. His contributions, featured alongside those of Gala Galaction, N. D. Cocea, and Tudor Arghezi, include another sketch story and a lyric poem. Sadoveanu was however dissatisfied with Densusianu's agenda, and critical of the entire Romanian Symbolist movement for which the review spoke. He ultimately began writing pieces for non-Symbolist magazines such as Opinia and Pagini Literare. In parallel, he founded and printed by hand a short-lived journal, known to researches as either Aurora or Lumea. Sadoveanu left for Bucharest in 1900, intending to study Law at the University's Faculty of Law, but withdrew soon after, deciding to dedicate himself to literature. He began frequenting the bohemian society in the capital, but, following a sudden change in outlook, abandoned poetry and focused his work entirely on Realist prose. In 1901, Sadoveanu married Ecaterina Balu, with whom he settled in Falticeni, where he began work on his first novellas and decided to make his living as a professional writer. His first draft for a novel, Fratii Potcoava (\\"The Potcoava Brothers\\"), came out in 1902, when fragments were published by Pagini Alese magazine under the pseudonym M. S. Cobuz. The following year, Sadoveanu was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, stationed as a guard near Targu Ocna, and inspired by the experience to write some of his first social criticism narratives. After that time, he spent much of his home in the country, where he raised a large family. Initially, the Sadoveanus lived in a house previously owned by celebrated Moldavian raconteur Ion Creanga, before they commissioned a new building, famed for its surrounding Gradina Linistii (\\"Garden of Quietude\\"). He was the father of eleven, among whom were three daughters: Despina, Teodora and Profira Sadoveanu, the latter of whom was a poet and a novelist.

Article: Republican leaders, racing against the clock to find a tough response to President Barack Obama’s immigration policies, are now left with two messy options: punt or risk getting blamed for shutting down an agency that fights terrorism. A punt is looking more likely by the hour. Story Continued Below On Monday evening, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved the Senate toward a standalone bill narrowly targeting the president’s 2014 executive action and sparing the 2012 action aimed only at certain young immigrants. It’s the GOP leader’s first step in trying to disentangle the immigration fight from a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Senior Republicans said privately earlier in the day that the party may have no choice now but to fund the agency on a short-term basis. The length of a so-called continuing resolution isn’t clear, but McConnell plans to discuss the matter with GOP senators in a closed-door lunch on Tuesday. The dual efforts — to potentially move a short-term funding bill and attack the immigration policies separately — are meant to signal to conservatives the GOP will continue to battle the president on immigration without jeopardizing DHS funding. While passing a short-term continuing resolution without restricting Obama on immigration would likely clear the Senate, it faces an uphill climb in the House, where it is unclear if conservatives will view the GOP’s evolving tactics as a run toward political cover. Both McConnell and Boehner have vowed to avoid any shutdowns — raising the stakes for the leaders in only the second month of a Congress now fully under GOP control. “There will be no shutdown,” one top Republican said privately Monday. The Republicans’ first choice — a bill that would keep DHS open while blocking Obama’s executive order shielding roughly 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation — stalled again in the Senate on Monday. For the fourth time this month, Senate Democrats filibustered the measure. The vote was 47-46. But with worries growing over national security preparedness in the event of a shutdown, an increasing number of Republicans said the party may have no option other than to extend the department’s funding for several weeks under a Continuing Resolution. “Clearly I’d prefer a CR over lapsing,” said Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who’s up for reelection next year. Though members of both parties don’t want a temporary fix —“I’m not for a short-term CR,” the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, said Monday — Republican leaders are unlikely to have a better alternative unless they can persuade their rank-and-file to defer to the courts. A Texas district judge recently blocked Obama’s November order, but the administration is appealing. “We’re in a really strange constitutional spot: That you can’t ignore a president who has exceeded his authority, but neither can you put the nation at risk,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.). “I don’t think [a shutdown] is going to happen. I think we’ll resolve it. I don’t hear anyone rushing to say: ‘Let’s have a shutdown to prove a point.’” Like many Republicans, Lankford refused to say whether he would vote for a continuing resolution with no immigration provisions. But he did say a delay is more likely than a shutdown because it would allow time for the GOP to continue to fight the immigration order — and he wasn’t alone on Monday. “That’s the most likely way out of it. I don’t think we ought to shut the government down, it doesn’t serve conservative ends,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). And after playing down the effects of a funding lapse last week, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is now calling for an end to the stalemate. A range of fall-back proposals continued to be floated on Monday. One would be to tie a short-term budget bill to the outcome of the Texas immigration case, another would be to file an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit. A number of outspoken conservatives — such as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — are trying to stiffen GOP leaders’ spines, arguing that Democrats will shoulder the blame if the department shuts down. And as McConnell began to search for a way out of the jam and his colleagues expressed openness to punting on the immigration fight, Cruz did little to hide his disregard for party leaders’ tactics. “There was a reason in December I so vigorously opposed the CRomnibus strategy: Because leadership had no way out,” Cruz said of a bill to fund the entire government until October, save for a short-term DHS bill that set up this month’s fight. “I now await, eagerly, leadership’s solution,” Cruz said. Neither Sessions nor Cruz would say if they would seek to throw procedural hurdles in front of a stopgap funding bill, which could add days to Senate consideration, with passage in the House anything but assured. Still, the approaching deadline could spur Congress to act, as deadlines typically do with one major exception: the government shutdown over Obamacare in 2013. The parallels were not lost on Democrats, who spent Monday circulating polls that showed Americans would blame Republicans for a shutdown and that they prefer immigration policy be kept separate from funding the homeland security agency. Democrats are also gleefully highlighting remarks from Republicans questioning GOP leaders’ strategy. Both Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona warned on Sunday of major political fallout for their party and urged the GOP to place its bets on the legal challenge to Obama’s executive actions. ”Leave it to the courts. It would be an excellent case for the Supreme Court,” McCain said on Monday, seeking to separate the funding deadline from the immigration fight. “I want to leave it to the courts and see how it all plays out.” But even as Republicans lamented their situation, they also blamed Democrats for refusing to debate a bill. Ever since the Senate minority rejected the House’s proposal from being debated on the floor, Republicans have tried to saddle Senate Democrats’ with responsibility for a potential shutdown. “If Democrats would quit filibustering and allow us to get on this bill, which fully funds the Department of Homeland Security, we’re [open] to letting them have amendments,” said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.). “Can’t finish the bill if you can’t start it.” But Hoeven, an appropriator who oversees homeland security spending, also threw cold water on a temporary bill. “I don’t support going to a CR. I think it would be better to get to a bill like we got and go through the process and offer amendments,” Hoeven said. “But at the end of day, whatever we pass, has to get through the House, too.” As the congressional standoff barrels to a climax, the Obama administration revved up its messaging machine. Flanked by nearly 30 employees from across the department and the chiefs of FEMA and Customs and Border Patrol, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Monday up to 80 percent of the department would work without pay in the event of a shutdown, while 30,000 employees would be furloughed, including 80 percent of FEMA. Though it seems the only way out of a shutdown he decries, the DHS secretary also lambasted a potential short-term funding bill and likened it to “trying to drive across the country with no more than 5 gallons of gas in your tank and you don’t know when the next gas station will appear.” Jake Sherman contributed to this report. ||||| Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he is changing tactics in an attempt to break a stalemate with Democrats ahead of Friday's deadline when the Department of Homeland Security will run out of money, after taking his fourth failed vote on a House-approved measure. On a measure that needed 60 votes to succeed, it failed with 47 voting in support to 46 against. McConnell said he would bring a separate bill to the floor this week that would block funding for the implementation of President Barack Obama's immigration executive orders -- provisions in the current DHS bill that Democrats object to. By separating the immigration matter from the DHS funding bill, McConnell hopes to satisfy conservatives by allowing them to vote against the immigration orders while allowing a so-called \\"clean\\" DHS bill possibly to move on a separate track. While it's too early to know if the new plan will work -- and there are many procedural hurdles that could doom it -- it's the first new idea in weeks to break the congressional logjam over DHS. Republicans also believe it will put on the spot a handful of centrist Democrats who raised concerns with the immigration orders but have so-far refused to vote against them as long as they were attached to the DHS bill. \\"Some Democrats give the impression they want Congress to address the overreach,\\" McConnell said. \\"But when they vote, they always seem to have an excuse for supporting actions they once criticized. So I'm going to begin proceedings on targeted legislation that would only address the most recent overreach from November. It isn't tied to DHS' funding. It removes their excuse.\\" Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, used the failed vote as an opportunity to blame Republicans for failing to fund the agency. \\"It's becoming clear Sen. McConnell realizes he must separate himself from the far right, but the bottom line is this proposal doesn't bring us any closer to actually funding DHS, and Republicans still have no real plan to achieve that goal,\\" he said. It's not apparent how many Democrats might be persuaded to vote against the immigration orders in a standalone bill and whether it would be enough to give Republicans the 60 votes they need to get over procedural hurdles. It is unlikely supporters could get the 67 votes needed to overcome a veto, which surely would come from the President should the legislation clear Congress. Before Monday's vote, Senate Democrats squabbled with House Republicans about who exactly was to blame for the ongoing standoff. There are only four days before DHS funding ends, which will leave large parts of the agency shuttered or employees will be forced to work without pay. \\"We passed a bill that fully funds the department,\\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said in an interview on CNN. \\"We'll probably see something come from the Senate this week and we'll have to make some tough choices. It would be irresponsible for lawmakers and policy-makers to shut down his national security agency at this grave time.\\" Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri urged her colleagues, via Twitter, to pass a funding measure to \\"show unity against terrorists.\\" \\"Let's pass funding for Homeland Security today to show unity against terrorists,\\" McCaskill tweeted. \\"Then R's can bring up immigration for vote immediately after.\\" Let's pass funding for Homeland Security today to show unity against terrorists.Then Rs can bring up immigration for vote immediately after. — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) February 23, 2015 But DHS is still prepping for the worst case scenario. In a letter to employees, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the department was making preparations \\"in the unlikely and unfortunate event that Congress does not fund DHS before Friday night a shutdown of this department occurs.\\" \\"Have faith that his difficult and unnecessary situation will be resolved,\\" Johnson said. ||||| Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, joined by the department employees, during a news conference in Washington, Monday, Feb. 23, 2015. A partial shutdown of the Homeland Security Department loomed... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Days from a Homeland Security Department shutdown, Senate Republicans sought a way out Monday by splitting President Barack Obama's contested immigration measures from the agency's funding bill. It was not clear whether the gambit by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would succeed ahead of Friday's midnight deadline to fund the department or see it shut down. It was far from certain whether it would win any Democratic support, and House conservatives remain firmly opposed to any funding bill for the Homeland Security Department that does not also overturn Obama's executive actions on immigration. But with Senate Democrats united against a House-passed bill that funds the agency while blocking the president on immigration, McConnell said it was time for another approach. \\"It's another way to get the Senate unstuck from a Democrat filibuster and move the debate forward,\\" McConnell said on the Senate floor after a vote to advance the House-passed bill failed 47-46, short of the 60 votes needed. Three previous attempts earlier in the month had yielded similar results. \\"This is our colleagues' chance to do exactly what they led their constituents to believe they'd do: defend the rule of law, without more excuses,\\" McConnell said in a jab at the handful of Senate Democrats who have voiced opposition to Obama's executive actions offering work permits and deportation deferrals for millions in the country illegally. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, welcomed McConnell's move, though without predicting its chances of success in the House. \\"This vote will highlight the irresponsible hypocrisy of any Senate Democrat who claims to oppose President Obama's executive overreach on immigration, but refuses to vote to stop it,\\" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. McConnell left unclear whether a vote overturning Obama's immigration moves would be followed by a stand-alone vote to fund the Homeland Security Department — an omission not lost on Senate Democrats. \\"With four days left to go before Homeland Security runs out, he's bringing a bill to the floor that doesn't fund Homeland Security,\\" said Adam Jentleson, spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. McConnell's move came after Obama warned the nation's governors that states would feel the economic pain of a Homeland Security shutdown, with tens of thousands of workers in line to be furloughed if the agency shuts down at midnight Friday, and many more forced to work without pay. \\"It will have a direct impact on your economy, and it will have a direct impact on America's national security,\\" Obama told governors as they visited the White House as part of their annual conference. Within hours of Republicans securing the Senate majority last November, McConnell vowed there would be no government shutdowns, but the immigration fight threatened to shut down the Homeland Security Department and undermine GOP promises that they would show the nation they could govern. McConnell's move seemed aimed at dividing Senate Democrats who have been united against the 39.7 billion House-passed legislation that funds the Homeland Security Department through the Sept. 30 end of the budget year, while also rolling back Obama's executive actions granting work permits to millions of immigrants in this country illegally. Aides said McConnell's bill would target only the executive actions Obama announced in November, not an earlier directive from 2012 that provided protections to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally to the country as youths. That could make it more difficult for the handful of moderate Democrats who opposed Obama's executive actions when he announced them in November to vote against the legislation. The move came as growing numbers of Senate Republicans called for Congress to jettison the immigration fight and pass a \\"clean\\" Homeland Security spending bill without immigration language. In wake of a federal court's ruling last week stating that Obama had exceeded his authority and putting his immigration policies on hold, several Senate Republicans said the courts were the best place to fight that battle. \\"Leave it to the courts. I think we have an excellent case before the Supreme Court,\\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Monday night. The Obama administration on Monday asked U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas, to put his ruling on hold and filed a notice of appeal of his ruling to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. House conservatives, by contrast, said the court developments only strengthened their resolve to use the Homeland Security budget to fight Obama on immigration. \\"A federal judge has confirmed that what we've done is the right thing,\\" conservative Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Monday. \\"I hope that the U.S. Senate can see the light and do the right thing.\\" A short-term extension of current funding levels remained possible, but lawmakers have only a few days to come up with even that partial solution before the agency's funding expires. A Homeland Security shutdown would result in some 30,000 administrative and other workers getting furloughed. Some 200,000 others would fall into essential categories and stay on the job at agencies like the Border Patrol, Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration, though mostly without drawing a paycheck until the situation is resolved. ___= Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Charles Babington contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"Republicans in the US are struggling to find an appropriate response to President Obama's immigration policies.

Article: Media caption Emergency workers were on the scene quickly after the crash The US authorities have begun an investigation into the causes of Sunday's train crash in the Bronx area of New York in which four people were killed and more than 60 injured. The 05:54 from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Station derailed as it went into a bend in the railway line near Spuyten Duyvil station. It was reportedly travelling faster than the speed limit in the area. The train's event recorder, similar to a flight recorder, has been recovered. The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the recorder. They are expected to be there for several days. 'Spinal injury' The Federal Railroad Administration has also sent a team of investigators. Officials have identified the deceased as Donna Smith, 54, James Lovell, 58, James Ferrari, 59, and Ahn Kisook, 35. Three of the dead were found outside the train, and one was found inside. Of the 150 or so who were on board, 11 remain critically injured.

On Monday, a second data recorder was found in the train's rear locomotive. Investigators said they hoped to download information on the speed and settings of the train from that recorder. Some 26,000 weekday commuters on the route were warned to brace for crowded trains on the first morning after the derailment. Train service south of Spuyten Duyvil has been \\"suspended until further notice\\", the train's operator, Metro-North, said on Monday morning. Buses were being provided to the New York subway system. Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said the bend where the derailment occurred was in a slow-speed area. The train appeared to be going \\"a lot faster\\" than normal as it approached the bend coming into the station, passenger Frank Tatulli told WABC-TV. The speed limit on the curve is 30mph (50km/h), compared with 70mph in the area approaching it, investigators said.

The Fire Department of New York says there are \\"multiple injuries\\"... (Associated Press) The National Transportation Safety Board said its investigators could spend up to 10 days probing all aspects of the early Sunday morning accident on Metro-North that toppled seven cars _ carrying roughly 150 passengers _ and the locomotive, leaving the lead car only inches from the water at a bend in the Bronx where the Hudson and Harlem rivers meet. The NTSB said it would consider whether excessive speed, mechanical problems or human error played a role in the crash. It was the latest accident in a troubled year for Metro-North, which had never experienced passenger death in an accident in its 31-year history. Late Sunday night, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees Metro-North, was preparing to begin using cranes to upright some of the toppled cars on the slight chance anyone might still be underneath. Joel Zaritsky, who was dozing as he traveled to a dental convention aboard the train, woke up to feel his car overturning several times. \\"Then I saw the gravel coming at me, and I heard people screaming,\\" he told The Associated Press, holding his bloody right hand. \\"There was smoke everywhere and debris. People were thrown to the other side of the train.\\" The MTA said it would provide shuttle buses Monday morning to ferry passengers between stops and to another rail line, but it urged riders who could work from home to do so. NTSB board member Earl Weener said at a press conference Sunday the agency had just begun its investigation and hadn't yet spoken to the train's conductor, who was among the injured. His name was not released. Investigators were due to examine factors ranging from the track condition to the crew's performance. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the track did not appear to be faulty, leaving speed as a possible culprit for the crash. The speed limit on the curve is 30 mph, compared with 70 mph in the area approaching it, Weener said. Authorities did not yet know how fast the train was traveling but had found a data recorder, he said. One passenger, Frank Tatulli, told WABC-TV that the train appeared to be going \\"a lot faster\\" than usual as it approached the sharp curve near the Spuyten Duyvil station. Nearby residents awoke to a building-shaking boom. Angel Gonzalez was in bed in his high-rise apartment overlooking the rail curve when he heard the roar. \\"I thought it was a plane that crashed,\\" he said. Within minutes, dozens of emergency crews arrived and carried passengers away on stretchers, some wearing neck braces. Others, bloodied and scratched, held ice packs to their heads. In their efforts to find passengers, rescuers shattered windows, searched nearby woods and waters and used pneumatic jacks and air bags to peer under wreckage. The MTA identified the victims Sunday as Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh; James G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring; James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; and Ahn Kisook, 35, of Queens. Three of the dead were found outside the train, and one was found inside, authorities said. Autopsies were scheduled for Monday, the New York City medical examiner's office said. Lovell, an audio technician, was traveling from his Cold Spring home to midtown Manhattan to work on the famed Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, said longtime friend Janet Barton. The tree-lighting ceremony is Wednesday night. Eleven of the injured were believed to be critically wounded and another six seriously hurt, according to the Fire Department. After visiting an area hospital Sunday evening, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters that the 11 who originally were critical no longer appeared to have life-threatening injuries. As deadly as the derailment was, the toll could have been far greater had it happened on a weekday, or had the lead car plunged into the water instead of nearing it. The train was about half-full at the time of the crash, rail officials said. For decades, the NTSB has been urging railroads to install technology that can stop derailing caused by excessive speed, along with other problems. A rail-safety law passed by Congress in 2008 gave commuter and freight railroads until the end of 2015 to install the systems, known as positive train control. PTC is aimed at preventing human error _ the cause of about 40 percent of train accidents. But the systems are expensive and complicated. Railroads are trying to push back the installation deadline another five to seven years. Metro-North is in the process of installing the technology. It now has what's called an \\"automatic train control\\" signal system, which automatically applies the brakes if an engineer fails to respond to an alert that indicates excessive speed. Such systems can slow trains in some circumstances but not bring them to a halt, said Grady Cothen, a former Federal Railroad Administration safety official. Sunday's accident came six months after an eastbound train derailed in Bridgeport, Conn., and was struck by a westbound train. The crash injured 73 passengers, two engineers and a conductor. In July, a freight train full of garbage derailed on the same Metro-North line near the site of Sunday's wreckage. ___ Associated Press writers Deepti Hajela, Colleen Long, Jake Pearson and Jennifer Peltz in New York, Joan Lowy in Washington and Stephen Singer in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report. ||||| Jim Lovell in an undated photo provided by his family. By Josh Dawsey and Will James Jim Lovell preferred life away from the spotlight: living on a secluded lake, caring for his family while his wife served as a town official and staging complex, behind-the-scenes effects for large entertainment events. “He would never seek the limelight,” said friend Jonathan Kruk. “It was almost like he didn’t have an ego. He was the one who made it possible, smiling behind the scenes.” Grieving family members and friends said the “Today” show audio technician was a family-oriented man who loved Hudson Valley history, good writing and adventures in the wild outdoors near his Cold Spring home. Mr. Lovell, 58 years old, had battled cancer and endured open-heart surgery, according to close friend Richard Shea. Another friend, John Zuvic, said Mr. Lovell’s flexible schedule allowed him to do what he cared about most – spending time with his sons. He often went fishing, swimming and windsurfing with them in nearby Lake Valhalla. “His main pastime was being with his boys,” he said. He was also fascinated by military history and played guitar, Mr. Zuvic said. Mr. Lovell had left the family’s home early Monday for Rockefeller Center, where he was preparing the Christmas tree for his televised premiere. “That was a challenge, to get the tree up and ready for the world,” Mr. Zuvic said. In a note to the staff, Don Nash, executive producer of “Today,” called Mr. Lovell “one of the nicest guys you ever met.” On Monday, his grieving son, Finn, described the emotional scene of learning of his father’s death. Finn had spent the night with a friend, who drove him home when his mother said to immediately return. His mom, Philipstown Town Councilwoman Nancy Montgomery, left for the Bronx and later returned to summon her sons into a room of the lakeside home. “All my brothers came into my room, he said. “And she said, ‘He’s gone.’” Finn, 17 years old, said his mom was being “strong for her boys, strong for the rest of the family.” Mr. Zuvic said he has been thinking about all the things he and Mr. Lovell had talked about doing together, like finishing a renovation project at Mr. Lovell’s home or camping with their children in the mountains nearby, that they would never get to do. “We were looking forward to a lot of things,” he said. ||||| It was not clear how fast the Metro-North train was going. But an official from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the train operator had reported that the train was going into the turn too fast and that he had performed an emergency braking maneuver. The operator told the first rescuers to reach the scene that he had “dumped” the brakes, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Dumping the brakes, railroad experts said, is a last-resort move that has the effect of slamming on the emergency brakes on all the cars of a train at once. It is usually done to avert a collision with another train or a vehicle at a grade-level crossing. Video Officials opened an investigation but cautioned that it would take time to piece together the evidence and identify a possible cause. The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the train’s “event recorders,” devices that are somewhat similar to the flight recorders on airplanes. The Federal Railroad Administration also dispatched a team of investigators. Earl F. Weener of the transportation safety board said at a morning news conference with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that investigators had yet to interview the operator of the train, who was among those injured. A spokeswoman for Metro-North said the engineer, identified as William Rockefeller of Germantown, N.Y., had about 14 years’ experience with the line. There were also three conductors on the train. “Our mission is to not just understand what happened but why it happened, with the intent of preventing it from happening again,” Mr. Weener said. The accident was the latest episode in a trying year for Metro-North, the nation’s second-largest commuter railroad, and the first with passenger fatalities in Metro-North’s 30-year history. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In May, two Metro-North trains slammed into each other near Fairfield, Conn., during the evening rush. Scores of passengers were hurt, five critically. And in July, a CSX freight train derailed near where the Metro-North train left the tracks on Sunday. Officials said there was no connection between the accidents. By Sunday night, the transportation safety board had given Metro-North clearance to begin removing the crippled train and repairing the tracks. But the crash was likely to disrupt the Monday commute for thousands of passengers on the railroad’s Hudson line. Metro-North arranged for buses to take Hudson line passengers to White Plains, N.Y., on Sunday to catch trains on a different line that was running normally. On Monday, Hudson line trains will be running as far south as Yonkers, where passengers will be able to catch buses to the 242nd Street station of the No. 1 train. The train jumped the tracks on one of the sharpest curves in the Metro-North system, not far from the Spuyten Duyvil station. Governor Cuomo said the Metro-North engineer had described applying the brakes as the train approached the curve, a stretch of track where the speed limit dropped to 30 miles an hour, from 70. But it was unclear whether the brakes had malfunctioned or had been activated too late. “We’ve always had this configuration — we didn’t have accidents, right?” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference. Video “It can’t just be the curve,” he said, adding, “There has to be another factor.” The train was propelled by a locomotive at the back end, as is customary on the Hudson line. Northbound trains are pulled by an engine at the front, but the trains are not turned around at the end of the line. Instead, southbound trains are pushed, with the locomotive at the back. As it came off the tracks, the train plowed up dirt as it burrowed into the ground. It came to a stop in a postcard scene of a late-autumn landscape, among bulrushes and trees that had long since lost their leaves. Police and Fire Department rescuers had to take down part of a chain-link fence to reach the tracks, not far from where the Hudson meets the Harlem River.

The rescuers put ladders up to one of the overturned cars, climbed in and “started pulling people out,” said Kevin Farrell, 28, a hospital administrator who lives in a co-op building overlooking the crash site. He said he watched passengers being helped out with their arms already in splints. Several were away taken on stretchers. The trip had begun before sunrise in Poughkeepsie, the riverfront town where New York’s colonial leaders ratified the United States Constitution. The train picked up a small collection of people with their own reasons to be riding a train into Manhattan so early on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. It stopped in Ossining an hour after it left Poughkeepsie, then in Tarrytown 18 minutes before the crash. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That was its last stop before 125th Street in Manhattan, where it was due 12 minutes after it derailed. Mr. Cuomo, at the news conference with Mr. Weener of the safety board, said more than once that “safety is Job 1.” “If there is a lesson to be learned from this tragedy,” the governor said, “we want to learn it.” The victims were identified as James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose, N.Y.; Kisook Ahn, 35, of Woodside, Queens; Jim G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring, N.Y.; and Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh, N.Y. The injured passengers were taken to a number of hospitals. A police officer who was on the train was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital with broken bones. The officer, a woman, was in stable condition, officials at the hospital said. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center said two of the 14 passengers it treated were in critical condition on Sunday night; five others were admitted. Four other passengers were treated at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Allen Pavilion, at Broadway and 220th Street. All four were released, the hospital said. Photo Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did not visit the accident scene, but Sunday night he visited victims at Montefiore Medical Center and at St. Barnabas. “The two families that I talked to, their loved ones were in serious but not critical condition, and the doctors had told them both that they were going to survive and, with some pain and that sort of thing, come out O.K.,” Mr. Bloomberg said after his visit to St. Barnabas, before he entered Montefiore. “Both very badly banged up; in one case the woman was in the operating room so I didn’t talk to her, I talked to family members,” he said. “In the other case, I talked to the police officer, who is 37 years old, been on the job for eight years, and she was in good spirits; actually, we joked about me being unemployed in 32 days and the fact that I was too old to join the Police Department. She had three kids and the kids are O.K. Somebody had taken care of them.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story He added, “The tragic thing is four people who aren’t going to come home. I think at this point most, if not all, of those that were critical look like they will be O.K., eventually.” The fire commissioner, Salvatore J. Cassano, said the consequences of the accident — the injuries and the disruptions — could have been worse if it had not happened on a Sunday morning. “On a work day, fully occupied, it would have been a tremendous disaster,” he said. But passengers said it was harrowing just the same. Some had fallen asleep, like Joel Zaritsky of Poughkeepsie, on his way to Manhattan for a dental convention, and Ryan Kelly of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., on his way to his job at a discount clothing store in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Kelly said he had holiday music playing on his headphones and woke up realizing that the train was tilting over. “I grabbed the seat and got thrown into the shelf where you put your stuff,” he said. “I hooked my hand in there and shielded my face with the other hand.” He said one hand was injured. Mr. Russell, who was in the third car from the back, said the train tipped and slid along “like a vacuum cleaner” as it came off the tracks, with gravel and dirt pouring in as the windows shattered. He gripped his seat as the train rolled over. “You had to hold the chair so you didn’t fall out,” he said. Mr. Russell said he helped other passengers before climbing out into a field of broken glass and debris. He was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where he was treated for back pain and released. He said he was rethinking his routine. “You think you’re safe on the train,” he said. “I know I’m going to be taking a car for a while.” ||||| As for so many other commuters from the river towns and suburbs north of New York City, the Metro-North Hudson line train was Jim Lovell’s lifeline, shuttling him from his Hudson Valley home to Grand Central Terminal in under 90 minutes whenever he had a job to do. On Sunday morning, the assignment was special: Mr. Lovell, a freelance media consultant with nearly 40 years of experience in sound, lights and production, had been hired to help set up the towering Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, which is to be lighted on Wednesday. He took the early train from Cold Spring, N.Y., on the banks of the Hudson River, bound for Manhattan. Boarding the train a few stops after Mr. Lovell, Donna L. Smith, 54, and her sister, Linda Smith, were making one of their occasional trips to the city for pleasure. Sometimes they took in a Mets game or went shopping; this time, Donna Smith was going to see her sister perform Handel’s “Messiah” with her choral group. Image Jim Lovell was one of four people killed in a derailment. But neither Mr. Lovell, 58, nor Donna Smith ever made it to Manhattan. They were two of four passengers killed when a southbound train derailed near the Spuyten Duyvil station just after 7 a.m. Sunday. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief statement or account of the main points of something.

Use the following highlights to write an article: 'I'd heard banging and drilling and thought he was doing some DIY', said burgled neighbour Neil Barton. Nathan Kennedy jailed for three-and-a-half years. Article:","completion":"Title: \\"The Disguised Sounds of Crime: Burglar Busted after Pretending to Do DIY\\" Intro: In an unexpected turn of events, Neil Barton, a concerned neighbor who thought his neighbor was merely completing a DIY project, discovered that Nathan Kennedy was, in fact, committing a burglary. Kennedy, who cleverly masked his criminal activities with the sounds of drilling and banging, has now been sentenced to three-and-a-half years of imprisonment. Paragraph 1: Neil Barton, an unsuspecting resident of a quiet neighborhood, had overheard continuous banging and drilling noises coming from next door, which led him to believe that his neighbor Nathan Kennedy was carrying out some DIY work. However, the truth proved to be far more sinister than initially anticipated. Paragraph 2: As time passed the noises continued, but Barton noticed that Kennedy was nowhere to be seen and had not mentioned any DIY projects. He decided to investigate further, and upon closer inspection, discovered that Kennedy had been committing a series of burglaries using the sounds of drilling and banging to camouflage his illegal activities. Paragraph 3: Once the menacing truth was unveiled, authorities were alerted, resulting in the apprehension of Nathan Kennedy. He was charged with multiple counts of burglary and, following a swift trial, sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars. The law enforcement officials commended Barton for his vigilance and quick thinking, which effectively led to Kennedy's arrest. Conclusion: Nathan Kennedy's deceptive tactics, involving the impersonation of DIY sounds to cover up his burglary spree, ultimately led to his downfall, thanks to the keen observation of his neighbor, Neil Barton.

These two questions are essentially the same, as they both inquire about the effect of onomatopoeia in a literary context. While the first question is framed more generally, the second question specifies the context as poetry. However, it can be inferred that onomatopoeia is a device commonly utilized in literature, including poetry, and that the implications would remain consistent in either context. Onomatopoeia refers to the literary device in which words mimic or resemble the sounds they represent. This technique can make a work, such as a poem, more engaging and vivid by creating a multisensory experience for the reader. In poetry specifically, onomatopoeia contributes to the overall tone, atmosphere, and emotional impact of the piece.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Many attackers look for individuals who are distracted and not aware of what’s happening around them. Avoid staring at your phone while you’re walking or on the bus, and instead, keep your eyes on the landscape and people around you. This can help you identify any potentially dangerous situations. It’s okay if you have your phone out or nearby—that could even be helpful if you need to call for help. Just don’t use it to the detriment of not knowing what’s going on around you. Pay attention to how people are acting, if someone is following or staring at you a lot, and any potential escape routes you could take in case something were to happen. Even if the person in the car seems kind, confused, or lost, don’t step up to an open window. If you can, cut across the street or behind some houses to get away from an unknown person who is trying to talk to you. Common ruses that would-be-abductors use are asking for directions or pretending to be looking for a lost pet. They assume that people, children especially, will take pity on them and want to be helpful. If this car circles back around to you again, try going to a neighbor’s house or calling your parents or the police. If you can, take note of the license plate number. You could also turn and walk in the opposite direction if you think a car is following you. If they also turn around, you know there is a potentially dangerous situation at hand. When someone is following you on foot, it’s important to get to the safety of other people or to at least get far enough away from them that they can’t easily grab you. The main goal is to prevent them from getting close enough to touch you or to coordinate an abduction with a second person waiting nearby in a car. Generally, there is more safety in numbers. Try ducking into a store or crossing over to a busier street. Abductors are less likely to strike when their victim is surrounded by other people. If you’re out shopping after dark, park as close to the front of the store as you can, and try to get a parking spot beneath a lamp post. If you are walking somewhere after dark, try to stay in well-lit areas where there are other people around. If you’re at a store, you could also ask an employee to escort you to your car. If you carry mace with you, make sure you know how to use it. If it lies forgotten at the bottom of your bag, it won’t help you if you’re attacked. Have an agreed-upon phrase that only you and your family members know. If someone approaches you and says they were sent by your parents to give you a ride home for whatever reason, they must be able to give you the code word. If they don’t know it, run away and find other adults. This code word or phrase should be something simple, yet unique, to your family that a stranger couldn’t easily guess. Even if the person approaching you knows your name and the names of your other family members, you still need to ask for the code. It’s possible they learned your names some other way and don’t actually know your family. If you feel that a person is off or they’re giving you weird vibes, trust that feeling. If you feel uncomfortable in any kind of situation, it’s okay to leave or ask someone to come get you. Attackers can use the promise of people being polite or afraid of being rude to their advantage, so resolve that you will trust your gut and keep yourself safe, even if that means you have to be “rude.” Our intuition often comes from a primal place that is meant to identify potential threats to our safety.","completion":"When you're outside, it's important to pay attention to what's happening around you and not just look at your phone.

It consists of 64 squares (8×8) of alternating dark and light color, often black and white. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - James Jerome Gibson (January 27, 1904 December 11, 1979), was an American psychologist who received his Ph.D. from Princeton University's Department of Psychology, and is considered one of the most important 20th century psychologists in the field of visual perception. Gibson challenged the idea that the nervous system actively constructs conscious visual perception, and instead promoted ecological psychology, in which the mind directly perceives environmental stimuli without additional cognitive construction or processing. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Gibson as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth. - David Everett Rumelhart (June 12, 1942 March 13, 2011) was an American psychologist who made many contributions to the formal analysis of human cognition, working primarily within the frameworks of mathematical psychology, symbolic artificial intelligence, and parallel distributed processing. He also admired formal linguistic approaches to cognition, and explored the possibility of formulating a formal grammar to capture the structure of stories. - Eleanor Jack Gibson ( December 7 , 1910 -- December 30 , 2002 ) was an American psychologist . Among her contributions to psychology , the most important are the study of perception in infants and toddlers . She is popularly known for the \`\` visual cliff '' experiment in which precocial animals , and crawling human infants , showed their ability to perceive depth by avoiding the deep side of a virtual cliff . Along with her husband James J. Gibson , she forwarded the concept that perceptual learning takes place by differentiation . Gibson is credited with creating the Gibsonian or ecological theory of development , which centers on the concept of affordances and how children learn to perceive them . According to Life magazine in 1959 , the \`\` Visual Cliff '' was \`\` a wooden table from the edge of which strong plate glass extended ... Children were put on the table top and coaxed to crawl out over the glass . But when they got to the edge of the cliff and looked down almost all of them quickly withdrew . Even their mothers ' most persuasive urgings could not get them out . '' Similar studies were done with animals , including rats and kittens . The visual cliff findings indicated that perception is an essentially adaptive process , or as Dr. Gibson put it , We perceive to learn , as well as learn to perceive . In 1982 , she was invited to Beijing to teach Chinese psychologists about recent theories and techniques of research . She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977 . In 1992 , Eleanor Gibson was awarded the National Medal of Science . A Review of General Psychology survey , published in 2002 , ranked Gibson as the 74th most cited psychologist of the 20th century , in a tie with Paul E. Meehl . - James Bowdoin II (August 7, 1726 November 6, 1790) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston, Massachusetts, during the American Revolution and the following decade. He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies. - The visual cliff apparatus was created by psychologists Eleanor J. Gibson and Richard D. Walk at Cornell University to investigate depth perception in human and animal species. This apparatus allowed them to experimentally adjust the optical and tactical stimuli associated with a simulated cliff while protecting the subjects from injury. The visual cliff consists of a sheet of Plexiglas that covers a cloth with a high-contrast checkerboard pattern. On one side the cloth is placed immediately beneath the Plexiglas, and on the other, it is dropped about 4 feet below. Since the Plexiglas supports the weight of the infant this is a visual cliff rather than a drop off. Using a visual cliff apparatus, Gibson and Walk examined possible perceptual differences at crawling age between human infants born preterm and human infants born at term without documented visual or motor impairments. - The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, frequently known as the American Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and a leading center for policy research in the United States. Election to the Academy is considered one of the nation's highest honors since its founding during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, and other scholar-patriots who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government, and the United States Constitution. - Eleanor Jack Gibson (7 December 1910 30 December 2002) was an American psychologist who focused on reading development and perceptual learning in infants and toddlers. In the 1960s and 1970s Gibson, with her husband James J. Gibson, created the Gibsonian ecological theory of development which emphasized how important perception was because it allows humans to adapt to their environments. Perhaps her most well-known contribution to psychology was the \\"visual cliff\\", which studied depth perception and visual or motor impairments in both human and animal species. This led to a new understanding of perceptual development in infants. The environment provides information for the sensory system to develop with increased stimuli, so perceptual development corresponds with environmental stimuli. Infants develop from adapting to the environment. Gibson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971 and as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. In 1992 she was awarded the National Medal of Science, which is the highest scientific honor in the United States, and only five of which have been awarded to psychologists. - Margaret Floy Washburn (July 25, 1871 October 29, 1939), leading American psychologist in the early 20th century, was best known for her experimental work in animal behavior and motor theory development. She was the first woman to be granted a PhD in psychology (1894), and the second woman, after Mary Whiton Calkins, to serve as an APA President (1921). A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Washburn as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Robert S. Woodworth. - Robert Sessions Woodworth (October 17, 1869 July 4, 1962) was an American academic psychologist of the first half of the twentieth century. He studied under William James along with such prominent psychologists as Leta Stetter Hollingworth, James Rowland Angell, and Edward Thorndike. A graduate of Harvard and Columbia, his textbook \\"Psychology: A study of mental life\\", which appeared first in 1921, went through many editions and was the first introduction to psychology for generations of undergraduate students. His 1938 textbook of Experimental Psychology was scarcely less influential, especially in the 1954 second edition, written with Harold H. Schlosberg. He is known for introducing the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) formula of behavior. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Woodworth as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Margaret Floy Washburn. - Perceptual learning is the process of learning improved skills of perception. These improvements range from simple sensory discriminations (e.g., distinguishing two musical tones from one another) to complex categorizations of spatial and temporal patterns relevant to real-world expertise (e.g., reading, seeing relations among chess pieces, knowing whether or not an X-ray image shows a tumor). Sensory modalities may include visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. Perceptual learning forms important foundations of complex cognitive processes (i.e., language) and interacts with other kinds of learning to produce perceptual expertise. Underlying perceptual learning are changes in the neural circuitry. The ability for perceptual learning is retained throughout life. - The National Medal of Science is an honor bestowed by the President of the United States to individuals in science and engineering who have made important contributions to the advancement of knowledge in the fields of behavioral and social sciences, biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics. The twelve member presidential Committee on the National Medal of Science is responsible for selecting award recipients and is administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF). - Louis Leon Thurstone (29 May 1887 30 September 1955) was a U.S. pioneer in the fields of psychometrics and psychophysics. He conceived the approach to measurement known as the law of comparative judgment, and is well known for his contributions to factor analysis. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Thurstone as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth.

The jobs the president is creating pay 9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing. And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs. Hypothesis: americas job market is growing","completion":"The task at hand is to determine whether the given hypothesis, 'America's job market is growing', can be drawn from the given context. Let's analyze the context provided step-by-step: 1. An initial mention of 'start creating jobs in America' seems to suggest that job creation is a needed and ongoing process, which might purport an intent for future growth. 2. The mention of the newly created jobs paying '9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing' implies that, while jobs may be being created, they are not of the same quality or income level as the jobs being lost. 3. The mention of the president presiding 'over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs' points to a net loss in jobs, countering the concept of growth. Based on these considerations, the hypothesis 'America's job market is growing' does not conform to the information given in the context. The context illustrates a current job market that is struggling with lower quality new jobs and a net loss of jobs, pointing more towards a decremented or stagnant job market rather than a growing one."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Their breakthrough came in 1991 with the release of their second studio album, Nevermind, which featured the hit single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" This marked the beginning of the grunge movement, and Nirvana's music resonated with millions of fans, solidifying their position as one of the most celebrated bands of their time. Despite their immense success and groundbreaking influence, Cobain struggled deeply with depression and substance abuse. Overwhelmed by the pressures of fame, his mental health, and his addiction to heroin, Cobain took his life at the age of 27, leaving behind a profound legacy. In summary, while Nirvana's extraordinary record sales and Cobain's role as a songwriter are noteworthy, they do not represent a reasonable answer to the question regarding the date of his death. Providing the correct date, April 5, 1994, along with context about Cobain's struggles and the impact of his loss on the music world, gives a more accurate and comprehensive response."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: - Water levels of a river or lake get higher - Water builds up on the ground - Water covers streets - Water gets deep in some places - Water goes into houses and other buildings - The rain stops or the dam is repaired - Water flows into streams - The rest of the floodwater evaporates. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process described here appears to pertain to the causes and unfolding events of a flood. Floods are naturally occurring phenomena caused by several factors, the main one being an excessive amount of water or precipitation. Given the series of events you've outlined, it can be assumed that the first step of the process is the event that triggers the rest of them: a significant increase in the water levels of a river or lake. To elaborate, water bodies like lakes and rivers have a certain carrying capacity, which is the maximum amount of water they can hold without overflowing. This carrying capacity can be influenced by various factors including topology, vegetation, soil composition, and artificially built structures like dams or levees. In a balanced environment, excess water in the river or lake—caused by prolonged or heavy rain, for example—will drain into the ground or flow downstream to other bodies of water, thereby maintaining the water level. However, there might be circumstances that prevent this natural drainage or increase the water flow into the river or lake. This could include upstream rain, snowmelt, a ruptured dam, changing weather patterns, or loss of vegetation. When the water input is too great for the lake or river to handle, the water level rises beyond its usual limit, causing it to overflow its banks. This is the first step in the flood process you outlined, and sets in motion a chain of events that can lead to widespread flooding: the water starts to build up on the ground, covers streets, gets deep in some places, and enters houses and other buildings, causing significant damage and potentially endangering lives. After the initial cause of the overflow—be it constant heavy rain or damaged infrastructure like a dam—is addressed or stops naturally, the floodwater will gradually recede. It will flow into streams or finally absorb into the ground, get taken up by plants, and some of it will eventually evaporate. This marks the concluding stages of the flood process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon general counsel threatened legal action Thursday against a former Navy SEAL who wrote a revealing book about last year's Osama bin Laden raid, warning him he has violated secrecy agreements and broken federal law. In a letter addressed to \\"Mark Owen,\\" the pen name of book author Matt Bissonnette, General Counsel Jeh Charles Johnson wrote the Pentagon is considering pursuing \\"all remedies legally available\\" against the former SEAL and his publisher, Penguin Putnam. \\"In the judgment of the Department of Defense, you are in material breach and violation of the nondisclosure agreements you signed.

Their latest project, dubbed the 'Orbiting Ore Asteroid,' has had numerous technical setbacks, doing only 3 days of work in over 6 months. To make matters worse, the vice-president in charge of operations, Alexander Throttle-bottom, has run off, making this the fourth vice-president that the operation has lost. Matters are further compounded when the site's assistant refuses to press the start button to activate the factory, or accept Spacely's offer for a promotion or raise.Using his secretarial computer, Spacely pegs George Jetson to be the new vice-president, sending George home to pack and tell his family. However, the news is met with with sadness, as the move will interfere with Jane's recycling program, Elroy's spaceball tournament, and Judy's date with rock star Cosmic Cosmo.Even so, the family manages to come together (with the exception of Judy who is sad about her missed date), and the family arrives at the 'Orbiting Ore Asteroid,' which not only houses the factory, but a shopping center and housing complex. The Jetsons meet their new neighbors, including Lucy-2, whose husband Rudy-2 works at the factory, and son Teddy-2 plays on the local spaceball team. They also meet the Furbolo family, including their mischievous daughter, Fergie.The next day, George arrives at work and meets Rudy-2. Rudy verses George on the factory equipment, and they prepare for the official start-up of the factory. Meanwhile, Jane and Judy go shopping with Lucy-2. Still feeling depressed, Judy goes off on her own, and meets a boy named Apollo Blue, whom she quickly develops a crush on.Later on that day, everyone turns out for the re-opening of the plant, with George activating the controls. However, the machine malfunctions again, irritating Spacely. Shortly thereafter, Rudy-2 reveals to George about previous technical issues with the plant, and cautions that it may be safer if George were to go home. George refuses, not wanting to give up on being vice-president. The next day, repairs appear to be made but the factory again malfunctions. Spacely blames George for the technical glitches, and leaves Earth to check on the factory.After inspecting the factory again, Rudy-2 reveals that the incidents do not appear to be accidents, but 'warnings' to shut down the plant. Rudy then explains about the factory's troubles, and of the 4 previous vice-presidents. George decides to stay overnight at the plant, and figure out just what is happening.Elroy and Teddy-2 sneak off to follow him. However, when their disappearance is found out, Jane asks Judy and Apollo Blue to try and find them. Judy and Apollo find both Elroy and Teddy-2 at the plant, along with Fergie, who tagged along. They also find a strange little creature, whose species Fergie identifies as a Grungee. The Grungee leads them into the core of the asteroid, where it is revealed why the factory keeps being sabotaged: The factory's enormous drill is destroying the Grungee's habitat in the base of the asteroid. The Grungees have been making the plant malfunction to keep their homes from being destroyed.Jane and Astro soon make their way into the factory, along with Rudy-2. Rudy stays in the factory, as Jane and Astro go below. Soon afterwards, they all find George, who had been bound and gagged by the Grungees. George has no idea why this has happened to him, untill Jane and the others explain.Shortly after this revelation, Mr Spacely arrives, and against Rudy-2's protestations, reactivates the drill, almost killing Elroy when it's actions cause a large amount of rock to collapse. The other Grungees manage to help him, and they all head top-side. After Mr Spacely refuses to stop the drill, George manage to make the system malfunction. When Spacely demands an explanation, George explains about the Grungees, and Spacely is soon found to have ignored reports that the asteroid was inhabited.A deal is made by which the Grungees operate the plant, Question: Judy Jetson is having a hard time adjusting, and accepting the fact that she lost her chance at a date who?","completion":"Judy Jetson is having a hard time adjusting, and accepting the fact that she lost her chance at a date with rock star Cosmic Cosmo."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the 19th-century, it was used in a much narrower sense by English writers to discuss developments in the early Italian libretto, e.g., \\"Rigoletto\\" and \\"Un ballo in maschera\\". Characteristic are the influence of French bourgeois drama, female instead of male protagonists, and the practice of opening the action with a chorus. - Opera seria (plural: \\"opere serie\\"; usually called \\"dramma per musica\\" or \\"melodramma serio\\") is an Italian musical term which refers to the noble and \\"serious\\" style of Italian opera that predominated in Europe from the 1710s to c. 1770. The term itself was rarely used at the time and only attained common usage once \\"opera seria\\" was becoming unfashionable and beginning to be viewed as a historical genre. The popular rival to \\"opera seria\\" was \\"opera buffa,\\" the 'comic' opera that took its cue from the improvisatory commedia dell'arte. - Italian Baroque (or \\"Barocco\\") is a stylistic period in Italian history and art that spanned from the late 16th century to the early 18th century. - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. - Thésée (\\"Theseus\\") is a \\"tragédie en musique\\", an early type of French opera, in a prologue and five acts with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully and a libretto by Philippe Quinault based on Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\". It was first performed on 11 January 1675 by the Paris Opera for the royal court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was first performed in public in April at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris. - The Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye is a royal palace in the commune of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in the \\"département\\" of Yvelines, about 19 km west of Paris, France. Today, it houses the Musée d'Archéologie Nationale (National Museum of Archaeology). - Ottone, re di Germania (\\"Otto, King of Germany\\", HWV 15) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, to an Italianlanguage libretto adapted by Nicola Francesco Haym from the libretto by Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino for Antonio Lotti's opera \\"Teofane\\". It was the first new opera written for the Royal Academy of Music (1719)'s fourth season and had its first performance on 12 January 1723 at the King's Theatre, Haymarket in London. Handel had assembled a cast of operatic superstars for this season and the opera became an enormous success. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - The Paris Opera() is the primary opera company of France. It was founded in 1669 by Louis XIV as the , and shortly thereafter was placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully and officially renamed the ', but continued to be known more simply as the . Classical ballet as we know it today arose within the Paris Opera as the Paris Opera Ballet and has remained an integral and important part of the company. Currently called the ', it mainly produces operas at its modern 2700-seat theatre Opéra Bastille which opened in 1989, and ballets and some classical operas at the older 1970-seat Palais Garnier which opened in 1875. Small scale and contemporary works are also staged in the 500-seat Amphitheatre under the Opéra Bastille. - Teseo ( \`\` Theseus '' , HWV 9 ; Italian pronunciation : ( tezo ) ) is an opera seria with music by George Frideric Handel , the only Handel opera that is in five acts . The Italian - language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym , after Philippe Quinault 's Thésée . It was Handel 's third London opera , intended to follow the success of Rinaldo after the unpopular Il pastor fido . First performed on 10 January 1713,Teseo featured \`\` magical '' effects such as flying dragons , transformation scenes and apparitions and had a cast of notable Italian opera singers . It was a success with London audiences , receiving thirteen performances even though the stage machinery for the \`\` magical '' effects broke down , and would have received more performances had not one of the theatre 's managers run away with the box office receipts . - Flavio, re de' Longobardi (\\"Flavio, King of the Lombards\\", HWV 16) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel. The Italian-language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym, after Matteo Noris's \\"Flavio Cuniberto\\". It was Handel's fourth full-length opera for the Royal Academy of Music. Handel had originally entitled the opera after the character of Emilia in the opera. - Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BC AD 17/18), known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars. - Dramma per musica (Italian, literally: \\"drama for music\\", plural: \\"drammi per musica\\") is a term which was used by dramatists in Italy and elsewhere between the late-17th and mid-19th centuries. In modern times the same meaning of \\"drama for music\\" was conveyed through the Italian Greek-rooted word \\"melodramma\\" (from = song or music + = scenic action). \\"Dramma per musica\\" never meant \\"drama \\"through\\" music\\", let alone music drama. - Theseus was the mythical king of Athens and was the son of Aethra by two fathers: Aegeus and Poseidon. - Nicola Francesco Haym (6 July 1678 31 July 1729) was an Italian opera librettist, composer, theatre manager and performer, and numismatist. He is best remembered for adapting texts into libretti for the London operas of George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini. Libretti that he provided for Handel included those for \\"Giulio Cesare\\", \\"Ottone\\", \\"Flavio\\", \\"Tamerlano\\", \\"Rodelinda\\", and several others; for Bononcini, he produced two, \\"Calfurnia\\" and \\"Astianatte\\". - An organ concerto is a piece of music, an instrumental concerto for a pipe organ soloist with an orchestra. The form first evolves in the 18th century, when composers including Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel wrote organ concertos with small orchestras, and with solo parts which rarely call for the organ pedal board. During the Classical period organ concerto became popular in many places, especially in Bavaria, Austria and Bohemia (whether called there a concerto, pastorella, or sonata), reaching a position of being almost an integral part of the church music tradition of \\"jubilus\\" character. From the Romantic era fewer works are known. Finally, there are some 20th- and 21st-century examples, of which the concerto by Francis Poulenc has entered the basic repertoire, and is quite frequently played. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Tamerlano (\\"Tamerlane\\", HWV 18) is an opera seria in three acts written for the Royal Academy of Music theatre company, with music by George Frideric Handel to an Italian text by Nicola Francesco Haym, adapted from Agostin Piovene's \\"Tamerlano\\" together with another libretto entitled \\"Bajazet\\" after Nicolas Pradon's \\"Tamerlan, ou La Mort de Bajazet\\". - Tragédie en musique (Musical tragedy), also known as tragédie lyrique (French lyric tragedy), is a genre of French opera introduced by Jean-Baptiste Lully and used by his followers until the second half of the eighteenth century. Operas in this genre are usually based on stories from Classical mythology or the Italian romantic epics of Tasso and Ariosto. The stories may not have a tragic ending in fact, they generally don't but the atmosphere must be noble and elevated. The standard \\"tragédie en musique\\" has five acts. Earlier works in the genre were preceded by an allegorical prologue and, during the lifetime of Louis XIV, these generally celebrated the king's noble qualities and his prowess in war. Each of the five acts usually follows a basic pattern, opening with an aria in which one of the main characters expresses their feelings, followed by dialogue in recitative interspersed with short arias (\\"petits airs\\"), in which the main business of the plot occurs. Each act traditionally ends with a \\"divertissement\\", offering great opportunities for the chorus and the ballet troupe. Composers sometimes changed the order of these features in an act for dramatic reasons. - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] 14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Giulio Cesare in Egitto (Italian for \\"Julius Caesar in Egypt\\", HWV 17), commonly known as Giulio Cesare, is a dramma per musica (\\"opera seria\\") in three acts composed for the Royal Academy of Music by George Frideric Handel in 1724. The libretto was written by Nicola Francesco Haym who used an earlier libretto by Giacomo Francesco Bussani, which had been set to music by Antonio Sartorio (1676). The opera was a success at its first performances, was frequently revived by Handel in his subsequent opera seasons and is now one of the most often performed Baroque operas. Composition history. \\"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\\" was first performed at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, London on 20 February 1724. The opera was an immediate success. A contemporary wrote in a letter on 10 March 1724: ...the opera is in full swing also, since Hendell's new one, called Jules César in which Cenesino and Cozzuna shine beyond all criticism has been put on. The house was just as full at the seventh performance as at the first. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Giovanni Bononcini (or Buononcini) (18 July 1670 9 July 1747) (sometimes cited also as Giovanni Battista Bononcini) was an Italian Baroque composer, cellist, singer and teacher, one of a family of string players and composers. - Italian opera is both the art of opera in Italy and opera in the Italian language. Opera was born in Italy around the year 1600 and Italian opera has continued to play a dominant role in the history of the form until the present day. Many famous operas in Italian were written by foreign composers, including Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632 22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661. - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists. - Opera buffa (plural: \\"opere buffe\\"; Italian for \\"comic opera\\") is a genre of opera. It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as \\"commedia in musica\\", \\"commedia per musica\\", \\"dramma bernesco\\", \\"dramma comico\\", \\"divertimento giocoso\\". - An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences. - The characters of the \\"\\" usually represent fixed social types, stock characters, such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains. The characters are exaggerated \\"real characters\\", such as a know it all doctor called Il Dottore, a greedy old man called Pantalone, or a perfect relationship like the Innamorati. - In Greek mythology, Aegeus or Aegeas, was an archaic figure in the founding myth of Athens. The \\"goat-man\\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens. - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter. What object entity has the relation of 'genre' with the subject 'teseo'? Choices: - action - allegory - archaeology - art - ballet - baroque - cantata - church music - comic - commedia per musica - concert - concerto - dance - democracy - design - drama - entertainment - family - genre - greek mythology - history - instrumental - libretto - love - march - mass - melodramma - military - music - musical - mythology - narrative - opera - opera buffa - opera seria - operetta - oratorio - philosophy - play - study - supernatural - tale - tragédie en musique - vocal music The answer is:","completion":"opera seria"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Previously vice-president, she ousted Malia Bouattia who was elected in 2016. Ms Bouattia ran into controversy when an article she co-wrote in 2011, describing Birmingham university as a \\"Zionist outpost\\", came to light. Ms Martin, a former student at Lewisham and Southwark College, highlighted the fact that she is \\"black single mother from a working-class family\\" during her campaign. Ms Martin told the BBC News website: \\"This is where I am coming from. It's the only thing I know. \\"I came into this campaign with nothing but overcoming adversity and challenges and barriers. \\"I was born into barriers and the struggle is real.\\" She said things began to change for her when she returned to college after the birth of her first daughter six years ago. Ms Martin saw an advert for the role of women's officer at her college student union and went for it. \\"Here the people didn't look like me or talk like me, but they had a heart like me. \\"The rest is history,\\" she added. The former student has promised a union which is \\"united and fighting for free education for everyone\\".

Former NUS presidents include Jack Straw, Charles Clarke, Liam Burns and Trevor Phillips. The new president pushed the standing president into second place winning by 402 votes to 272. The NUS paid tribute to Ms Bouattia's efforts to make the student movement \\"more diverse\\" and representative. In her speech seeking re-election, she spoke of the death threats and harassment she had faced during her presidency. She was the first black Muslim to hold the post of NUS president, repeatedly denied accusations of anti-Semitism and also apologised for her past comments about Birmingham University. A string of disaffiliation votes by student unions around the country during the summer followed the controversy. However, most of these had actually been set in train before the issue flared up. Three of the 26 who held referendums, Loughborough, Hull, and Newcastle universities, disaffiliated. Then a group of student leaders wrote an open letter saying Jewish students had not felt safe \\"participating in our national movement\\". The third candidate, Tom Harwood, who won just 35 votes, stood on a platform of \\"re-legitimising\\" the student movement and speaking \\"for all students\\". \\"We should be fighting credible battles, and offering constructive solutions.

The initial statement only provides information about a boy engaged in the activity of climbing a tree. It does not provide any information about the boy's motivation, intentions, or relationship with other individuals. It is important not to infer or draw unsupported conclusions based on a single statement without further context. In contrast, the second statement involves two individuals, specifically siblings, and describes a different action - one child running away from their brother. This statement suggests a different context or scenario altogether, potentially involving a game or disagreement between siblings. To establish a logical connection between the two statements, there has to be additional information that ties the actions or situations together. For example, if we were told that \\"A boy is climbing on top of a tree to hide from his brother during a game of hide-and-seek,\\" then a connection could be established, as it would provide a shared context for both statements.

The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot). Delassalle also has a relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Nicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she learns it is not actually Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin. When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says it was Michel who punished him. After hearing this, Christina becomes very sick and is unable to be photographed for the school photo. However, it appears that Michel appears in the photo standing in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool.

Possible answers: [+] unacceptable [+] acceptable...I think the answer is","completion":"To determine whether a linguist would rate this sentence as linguistically acceptable or not, let's examine the sentence structure and grammar. Sentence: \\"Fred must have both been singing songs and been drinking beer.\\" Step 1: Analyze the sentence structure and identify the main components. The subject is 'Fred,' the modal verb is 'must,' and the verbs are 'be singing songs' and 'be drinking beer.' Step 2: Check for appropriate usage of the conjunction 'both.' 'Both' is used to connect two or more elements that are equally applicable to the subject. In this case, 'singing songs' and 'drinking beer' seem to be the two actions that 'Fred' is performing. Step 3: Examine the verb structure. 'Must have been' is used here as a modal verb to indicate past possibility. It is correctly followed by the past participle form of the verb 'to be,' which is 'been.' Step 4: Analyze the consistency in verb structure. In this case, the verb structure is consistent: 'been singing songs' and 'been drinking beer' both use 'been' and the present participle form of their respective verbs. After analyzing the sentence, it appears to be grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. Therefore, a linguist would likely rate this sentence as [+] [+] acceptable."},{"prompt":"Process: - Coal is mined out of the ground - Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin - Electricity is produced.

The feed was launched just over a month ago as part of a promotional push for their upcoming movie, \\"Muppets Most Wanted.\\" But in between quippy posters and ads for the film, which is a sequel to 2011's blockbuster \\"The Muppets\\" with Jason Segel, there are ingenious \\"selfies\\" from the Muppets crew. In fact, the first post was a coy snapshot from Kermit, Miss Piggy and Gonzo, with a filter in full effect: And the selfies grew more adorable -- and more hilarious -- from there: We now have evidence of the time Animal burst in on Beaker in the bathroom. And we know what Gonzo does after a hard day of stunts. \\"Gonzo treated himself to a massage today to try to work out all of his stuntman kinks. Even weirdos need pampering. #bougielife #yolo,\\" reads the caption to this pic: The Muppets' curmudgeonly yet lovable critics, Statler and Waldorf, are still trying to get the hang of taking the perfect selfie -- \\"This is the fanciest calculator we've ever seen!\\" they were heard saying when the photo was taken -- while Rowlf is clearly a selfie king. From the Swedish Chef to Miss Piggy's evil alter ego, everyone has gotten in on the first-person photo sessions. The only people noticeably missing from the account are the Muppets' human co-stars in \\"Muppets Most Wanted,\\" like Tina Fey, Ty Burrell and Ricky Gervais.

Article:Sadly that is far from the case, and in practice, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get definitive rulings in international law involving military intervention. There is no international court on hand to give the legal go-ahead to intervene. However, there is a developing legal framework for military intervention on humanitarian grounds. Known as the Responsibility to Protect, or R2P, it was born out of the humanitarian disasters of the 1990s in Kosovo and Rwanda. It is widely but not universally accepted and has three principal elements: In order to have maximum legitimacy, military intervention should be authorised by the UN Security Council. It holds a unique position as the primary arbiter on the use of force in international law. However, as in the case of Syria, it may be hamstrung by a lack of consensus, with one or more members opposed to action. In these situations, according to one view, R2P provides a legal framework for the international community to use military force as a last resort - either by way of a regional coalition or a so-called \\"coalition of the willing\\". There are a number of safeguards in R2P: In other words, it is a limited power to act. However, if all of the criteria are met, then the limited and targeted use of military force would be legal in international law under R2P, some lawyers and commentators believe. Ultimately though, military interventions in these circumstances are up to governments rather than lawyers. It is for them to make the case for military intervention by showing that the legal requirements have been met. In the case of Syria, they will argue that there is an ongoing atrocity, all peaceful means of stopping it have been exhausted, and that targeted military action could achieve the twin goals of ending the atrocity and protecting the civilian population. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses the challenges of obtaining definitive rulings in international law regarding military intervention.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who said that she was engaged?, using the article: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"In order to validate the suggested answer, it is essential to provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date list of countries where marijuana has been legalized. While the legality of cannabis indeed varies from country to country, the answer would be more detailed if it at least mentioned some countries that have adopted a more lenient approach towards the use of marijuana. Here is a more detailed response: The legalization of marijuana has been an ongoing debate worldwide, with many countries taking different approaches. As mentioned, the legality of cannabis does indeed vary from country to country, with some nations fully legalizing it for recreational use, while others restrict it to medicinal purposes or decriminalize it. While it is difficult to provide an exhaustive list of all the countries that have legalized marijuana to some extent, here are some notable examples: 1. Canada: In 2018, Canada became the second country in the world to fully legalize recreational marijuana nationwide. Medical marijuana has been legal since 2001. 2. Uruguay: In 2013, Uruguay was the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational use. 3. The Netherlands: Although not officially legal, marijuana has been decriminalized for personal use since 1976. Amsterdam is particularly well-known for its coffee shops where you can buy and consume marijuana. 4. United States: The legal status of marijuana varies from state to state. As of 2021, 18 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana, while 36 states have legalized it for medical use. However, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. 5. Georgia: In 2018, the Georgian Constitutional Court decriminalized marijuana consumption, although selling and cultivation remain illegal. 6. South Africa: In a landmark ruling in 2018, South Africa decriminalized the private use and cultivation of marijuana for adults. 7. Portugal: In 2001, Portugal decriminalized possession and use of all drugs, including marijuana. Though cannabis is still illegal, those found in possession of small amounts are referred to rehabilitation and treatment programs instead of facing criminal prosecution. 8. Spain: While marijuana remains illegal according to the country's criminal code, personal use and cultivation in private spaces have been decriminalized. Additionally, Cannabis Social Clubs, non-profit organizations for marijuana growers and consumers, operate in a legal gray area. 9. Mexico: In 2021, Mexico's Supreme Court declared the criminalization of recreational marijuana to be unconstitutional, paving the way for future legalization. 10. Israel: Medical marijuana has been legal in Israel since the early 1990s, but recreational use remains illegal. However, Israel has started to decriminalize marijuana possession, treating it as an administrative offense rather than a criminal violation. While this list is by no means exhaustive, it provides a more informative and in-depth answer to the question of which countries legalize marijuana. The suggested answer in the automated response should be updated to reflect this broader scope of information in order to ensure accuracy and depth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, Facebook is eliminating a feature that allowed people to retain some portions of their anonymity on its website. These changes come on the heels of Google's move to explore replacing tracking cookies with something that users have even less control over. Microsoft is doing something similar by developing its own tracking technology. The company knows exactly what I am thinking about, how much I am thinking about it, and when I stop thinking about it: all from my OPTIONS: - Bruce Schneier searches. - CNN searches. - Do Not Track searches. - Facebook searches. - Google searches. - Microsoft searches. - Schneier searches.","completion":"The correct answer is: - Google searches. The story largely centers around Google’s recent changes to its advertising system, tracking user behavior, and subsequently manipulating ads based on the user data collected by Google searches. As such, it would be most logical to conclude that the company mentioned in the last line is Google, and that they have knowledge of the user's thoughts through their Google searches. Explanation for wrong answers: - Bruce Schneier searches, Schneier searches: Bruce Schneier is an American cryptographer, computer security professional, privacy specialist, and writer. However, he is not mentioned anywhere in the context. Hence, these options are irrelevant. - CNN searches: The source of this story is CNN, but they are not the subject of the story. So, it would not make sense logically to conclude the story with \\"CNN searches.\\" - Do Not Track searches: Do Not Track is a concept that involves users not being tracked across the web. It is not mentioned in the story and isn't a search engine or company, so this can't be the right answer. - Facebook searches: While Facebook is mentioned in the story, it's not the main focus. The primary focus is on Google's activities, making this option less pertinent than \\"Google searches.\\" - Microsoft searches: Though the story mentions Microsoft's activities, it doesn't emphasize upon Microsoft tracking the thoughts of its users. Moreover, the core of the story focuses more on Google's tracking techniques."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does \\"Lord Kilbracken said that only one person out of the 2,372 individuals with HIV/AIDS mentioned in a specific Department of Health report was not a member of a \\"high risk group\\", such as homosexuals and recreational drug users.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"Which groups were classified as being at a high risk for AIDS?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Lord Kilbracken said that only one person out of the 2,372 individuals with HIV/AIDS mentioned in a specific Department of Health report was not a member of a 'high risk group,' such as homosexuals and recreational drug users\\" does contain information that can be used to answer the question, \\"Which groups were classified as being at high risk for AIDS?\\" Based on the statement, it can be inferred that the high-risk groups mentioned in the Department of Health report include: 1. Homosexuals: This group refers to individuals who are sexually attracted to members of the same sex. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, HIV/AIDS was predominantly associated with the homosexual community, particularly gay men. This was mainly due to the ways in which the virus was transmitted, which included unprotected sex and sharing contaminated needles. During that time, it was not well-understood how to prevent the transmission of the virus, which resulted in higher rates of HIV/AIDS cases within this community. 2. Recreational drug users: This group refers to individuals who use drugs for recreational purposes, often in social settings or to achieve a certain mental state or \\"high.\\" Sharing needles, pipes, or other drug paraphernalia increases the risk of transmitting HIV/AIDS. Moreover, drug use can also impair judgment and decision-making abilities, leading to risky sexual behaviors that increase the chances of exposure to HIV. It is important to note that the high-risk groups identified in the Department of Health report are not exhaustive. Various factors can contribute to an individual being at risk for HIV/AIDS, such as engaging in unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners, or being the partner of an HIV-positive individual. Other groups that may be considered at high risk, depending on the time frame and context of the report, include sex workers, individuals who have received contaminated blood transfusions, and people living in areas with high rates of HIV infection. While the statement helps identify some of the groups considered to be at high risk for AIDS, it is crucial to remember that HIV/AIDS affects people from all walks of life and demographics. Comprehensive and inclusive prevention and education efforts remain important tools in addressing the global HIV/AIDS epidemic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I asked, \\"When do you stop worry?\\" The nurse said, \\"When they get out of the accident stage. \\" My mother just smiled gently and said nothing.

A friend said, \\" They're trying to find themselves, Don't worry, in a few years, you can stop worrying. They'll be adults. \\" My mother just smiled gently and said nothing. By the time I was 50, I was sick and tired of being weak. I was still worrying over my children, but there was a new wrinkle, there was nothing I could do about it. My mother just smiled gently and said nothing. I continued to suffer from their failures, and be absorbed in their disappointments. My friends said that when my kids got married I could stop worrying and lead my own life. I wanted to believe that, but I was haunted by my mother's warm smile and her occasional \\"You look pale.

Hours and hours of hilarious entertainment that anyone can enjoy without running into your typical norms for the current state of TV (frank dialogue of a sexual nature, cursing, [although I heard an H-word in the episode where the kids spend the night at Sandra's apartment], etc.). And although this bundle doesn't have the terrific artwork that went into the first two seasons' sets, each disc is housed in its own slim DVD case which is a little less nerve-wracking when taking out a disc than usual. And the menus have been nicely re-designed but there is no \\"PLAY ALL\\" option like before and no special features. But there are subtitles now, so that's cool. Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The review is overall positive. The reviewer expresses satisfaction with the bundled seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series in question, stating that it provides \\"hours and hours of hilarious entertainment.\\" The reviewer appreciates the set's departure from modern TV norms like explicit sexual dialogue and cursing, which suggests that they find the content suitable and enjoyable for a broad range of viewers. Even though they mention hearing a curse word in one episode, it doesn't appear to significantly hinder their positive viewing experience. Another point of praise is the DVD packaging. The reviewer finds the individual slim DVD cases for each disc less nerve-wracking when handling the discs than other packaging methods they've encountered, indicating a more user-friendly experience. They also commend the redesigned menus, although they note the absence of a 'play all' option and lack of special features, which shows a slight disappointment but does not overtly influence their overall impression. The reviewer also mentions that the set lacks the impressive artwork of the first two seasons, however, it does not deter them from enjoying the content. Finally, the addition of subtitles is seen as a positive update, further contributing to the reviewer's overall satisfaction. While there are minor criticisms within the review, these are significantly overshadowed by the praise for the principal product – the TV show content and the viewing experience. Therefore, the review can be classified as positive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Negative movie review: Title: Disappointing Dystopia Step 1: Choose a movie for the review and introduce it negatively. In the world of science fiction films, the dystopian genre can offer thrilling adventures and thought-provoking ideas. However, \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" fails to transport its audience to a world worth exploring. Step 2: Critique the plot and the storytelling. One of the main issues with \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" is its poorly executed and predictable plot. The storyline lacks originality, often retreading the same themes and scenarios seen in previous dystopian films. The obvious twists and turns leave audience members uninvested in the narrative, leading to an overall unsatisfying viewing experience. Step 3: Comment on the characters and acting. The characters in \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" are underdeveloped, rendering it difficult for viewers to empathize with their struggles. Stereotypical portrayals of the protagonist, villain, and supporting characters discourage emotional investment, while flat acting further distances viewers from a connection to the characters' journey. Step 4: Discuss the film's visuals and special effects. Unfortunately, \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" falls short in the visual department as well. The special effects feel dated and unconvincing, and the overall set design lacks imagination. Instead of being transported to a unique, immersive world, viewers are confronted with visuals that are hard to take seriously. Step 5: Comment on the soundtrack and audio elements. The film's soundtrack and audio elements are a further letdown. A repetitive score that fails to evoke any emotion contributes to the lackluster vibes of the movie, while poor sound design creates a disjointed experience for the audience. Step 6: Provide a summarizing statement and recommendations. In conclusion, \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" is a lackluster entry in the dystopian genre. The weak plot, unengaging characters, poor visuals, and uninspiring audio elements culminate in a forgettable experience that does not live up to the potential the genre offers. It is recommended that viewers instead seek out other films within the dystopian genre that have successfully captivated audiences and pushed boundaries."},{"prompt":"Both gross and tragic.

The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior.

Ever mindlessly 'liked' a total stranger's picture on Instagram? One man did just that - and the photo's owner turned out to be his future wife. Andrew Dearling, 28, from London, was scouring the social media site one day when he stumbled across Nashville-born Nicole Drummond's page, liking a few of her snaps. Nicole lived over 4,000 miles away and was engaged to someone else when she 'liked' some of Andrew's photos back. A slew of communication followed via text messages and FaceTime, which later resulted in a plane journey, a first meeting, and then a guest-free wedding. And it seems that the couple are part of a growing number of tech-savvy romantics meeting their other halves on the picture-sharing site. Scroll down for video. Andrew Dearling stumbled across Nashville-born Nicole Drummond's page on Instagram and after liking a few of her snaps, the pair got chatting and decided to meet. A year later, they are happily married. Andrew, who worked at a PR agency in London, stumbled across Nicole's picture while browsing a video game hashtag for #Halo, leading Nicole - who works in Human Resources and like Andrew, loves gaming - to investigate who he was. 'I was curious about the random person who had liked my photo, so I went over to his Instagram and saw how cute he was,' she told MailOnline recently. 'And he was from London! So I started liking some of his selfies and London shots and then we exchanged phone numbers and used iMessage to chat.' The Instagram fanatics documented every step of their relationship in snaps. In fact, most of their friends only found out they had tied the knot when the couple shared it online. The pair kept their followers up-to-date with their nuptials after tying the knot in New York and hashtagging this snap #instalove. True to the nature of their digital love affair, Andrew only discovered that Nicole was engaged when he browsed her Tumblr page. 'When I asked her about it, she admitted it but said she wasn’t really in love,' Andrew recalls. 'So, I just continued to message and flirt with her.' Last September, Andrew made the trip to 30-year-old Nicole's home in Nashville, where he wasted no time in proposing. Nicole accepted and the couple embarked on a 900-mile road trip to move Nicole to New York City, where she had scored a new job. Following their nuptials, Andrew headed home, but then moved out to New York in December 2013 to be with Nicole. After only two meetings, Andrew proposed when he went to visit Nicole in the States. He later moved from London to the States to start his life with her.

The structure that Adam was in was more unstable than that of Aaron's because","completion":"the materials used in its construction were not as resilient, and the design itself incorporated a number of architectural weaknesses. While Aaron's building had been meticulously planned and constructed according to modern engineering standards, Adam's makeshift structure seemed to lack the necessary foresight and precision that would have ensured its strength and longevity. First and foremost, the foundation of Adam's structure was constructed on an uneven and inadequately prepared base. This poor site preparation meant that the building was not evenly supported, leading to uneven distribution of weight throughout the structure. Consequently, the foundation began to sink on one side, causing significant structural stress and creating cracks in the walls and ceiling. In contrast, Aaron's building was erected on a level site with a properly reinforced foundation, ensuring stability and support for the building's entire weight. Furthermore, the materials used in the construction of Adam's structure were subpar and showed signs of wear and tear even before the building was fully completed. It appeared that cost-cutting measures had led to the use of cheaper, lower-quality materials in an effort to save money. This affected the building's overall strength, as the walls were more susceptible to damage from harsh weather conditions and other external forces. Aaron's building, on the other hand, utilized higher-grade materials such as steel and concrete, which offered superior durability and resistance against the elements. Another issue with Adam's building was its design. The structure seemed to be a hodgepodge of architectural styles, with numerous irregular angles and unsupported overhangs that placed unnecessary strain on key support beams. This architectural inconsistency not only compromised the visual aesthetics of the building, but also made it more prone to structural failures due to the increased stresses on the various components. In contrast, Aaron's structure followed a functional, minimalist design that prioritized structural integrity over excessive ornamental details. The building employed a simple, logical layout that allowed for efficient use of space and made the best possible use of the internal support structures, providing enhanced stability and resilience. Moreover, it seemed that Adam's building had been constructed in haste, their contractors not following the necessary regulations and safety protocols that would be expected on a modern construction site. Corners were cut, and the end result was a structure with numerous leaking pipes, shoddy electrical wiring, and failures in the insulation. These issues would likely necessitate costly repairs and potential future breakdowns, undermining the building's overall longevity. In comparison, Aaron's building was constructed by a team of skilled workers who adhered to best practices, and the result was a well-executed structure with no major issues to speak of. Lastly, it is important to consider the quality of maintenance and upkeep for both buildings. While Aaron continually invested in the upkeep of his structure, performing regular inspections and addressing minor issues before they could become larger problems, Adam appeared to be neglectful in the maintenance of his building. This neglect further exacerbated the existing structural and design-related issues, making the structure more dangerous and even more unstable over time. In conclusion, the disparity in stability between Adam's and Aaron's structures can be attributed to a multitude of factors, including poor site preparation, substandard construction materials, a haphazard design, rushed construction practices, and a lack of ongoing maintenance and upkeep. While Aaron's building was thoughtfully designed, carefully constructed, and well-maintained, Adam's structure suffered from a series of compounding issues that made it far more unstable than its counterpart. Ultimately, this comparison serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of proper planning, resource allocation, and attention to detail when it comes to the construction and maintenance of any building."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How did the season end for the Pirates? Context: In 1969 the Cubs, managed by Leo Durocher, built a substantial lead in the newly created National League Eastern Division by mid-August. Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range, Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her \\"the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs\\", despite not being a \\"heavyweight talent.\\" According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, \\"Madonna's vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs \\"straight,\\" but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.\\" Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as \\"Minnie Mouse on helium\\". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, \\"I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using.

The Director's storytelling captures the artistic grandeur of the film, weaving together a fascinating narrative about a young painter, Charlie, who struggles with his failing vision. What sets \\"The Majestic Light\\" apart isn't just its innovative approach to portraying an artist's life but also how deftly it underlines the unbreakable strength of human spirit. Lane delicately guides her audience through Charlie's world in such a way that you can't help but feel a powerful gravity towards his situation - he becomes an example of courage and determination. The cinematography is undeniably exceptional. Each scene is meticulously crafted, truly a spectacle for the eyes.

The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens.

Technological Advancements - The rapid pace of technological advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have made it possible for businesses to develop new products and services, while also improving existing ones. This has created significant opportunities for organizations to expand their market share and drive growth via digital transformation initiatives. 2.

This requires businesses to adapt their strategies and operations in order to meet the changing demands of their customers and stay relevant in the digital age. 3. Competitive Pressure - With more and more organizations recognizing the need for digital transformation in order to stay competitive, there is a growing pressure on companies to invest in digital transformation projects and keep up with industry leaders. This has created a virtuous cycle, wherein the more companies invest in digital transformation, the more others feel compelled to do the same in order to stay ahead. 4. Cost Savings and Operational Efficiency - Digital transformation projects often enable businesses to streamline their operations, automate manual processes, and reduce costs. This, in turn, leads to improved operational efficiency and higher profit margins, which can be reinvested in further digital transformation initiatives. 5.

Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat. - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements. - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya . - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony.

Read this and answer the question During Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason and found guilty, but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).

Please answer the following question: Article: For the first time, scientists have found a planet beyond the solar system that not only is the same size as Earth, but has the same proportions of iron and rock, a key step in an ongoing quest to find potentially habitable sister worlds. The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away. Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars. While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours. Question: Scientists are still not sure about Kepler-78b _ Yes or no, is the answer \\"why it circles so close to its host star\\"?

Q:Given the following context: The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion.

Can we infer the following? Rafik Hariri was lucky to survive a massive car bomb.","completion":"Based on the information provided that a massive car bomb killed the former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, it would be incorrect to infer that Rafik Hariri was lucky to survive the massive car bomb. Rather, Hariri tragically lost his life as a result of the attack. It is important to analyze the statement accurately, given that it states he was killed in the incident. Lebanon has a long history of political struggle and violence that often involves bombings and assassinations. The assassination of Rafik Hariri, a prominent and influential Lebanese politician, sent shockwaves across the country and the world. His untimely death was a significant loss to Lebanon's political landscape and stability. This tragedy has led to widespread mourning across Lebanon and has raised concerns and questions about the security of the country and the safety of political figures. In order to understand the context and impact of Hariri's assassination, it is crucial to look at his political career and what he represented. Rafik Hariri, a successful businessman and philanthropist, served as Prime Minister five times between 1992 and 2004. He played a pivotal role in rebuilding Lebanon after the end of the civil war in 1990 and was able to attract significant foreign investment to stimulate economic growth. Hariri's policies and actions had both supporters and detractors within Lebanon and abroad. He was particularly focused on economic development, with an emphasis on tourism and infrastructure projects that helped modernize Beirut, the capital city. However, these policies also led to a rise in public debt, which contributed to economic difficulties and criticisms of Hariri's governance. Politically, Hariri was a significant figure in the broader regional context, advocating for Lebanon to maintain its sovereignty and resist foreign influence, particularly from Syria. His stance against Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs, along with his internal rivalries with other political factions, made Hariri a target for various adversaries. In conclusion, it is incorrect to infer that Rafik Hariri was lucky to survive the massive car bomb, as he unfortunately lost his life in the attack. The assassination of Rafik Hariri left a huge vacuum in Lebanon's political sphere and had far-reaching consequences for the country's stability and security. It is essential to recognize the tragic event's significance and its lasting effects on Lebanon's political landscape and the safety of its leaders."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Grandaddy is an American indie rock band from Modesto, California. The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios. Common lyrical themes include technology and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as \\"one's attempt to transcend the glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral\\". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band \\"provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen\\". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's \\"geeky identification with technology\\". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's \\"sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape\\". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating \\"I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects\\" and how the song \\"I'm on Standby\\" is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: \\"I was spending so much time learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'\\". Lytle said of the tracks on Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla: \\"For some reason, they are tied together by the idea of being fed up with your environment.\\" He stated in 2001: \\"I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it.\\" There is also much humor in Lytle's songwriting, including the band's promotional Christmas single released in 2000, \\"Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland\\", which was also included on the charity compilation It's a Cool Cool Christmas, described by AllMusic's Tim DiGravina as possibly \\"the funniest song from 2000\\".

CAESAR A:","completion":"Title: CAESAR's Legacy Genre: Sci-fi, Action, Drama Setting: A distant future where Earth has become uninhabitable due to overexploitation of resources and the fallout of several catastrophic wars between rival human factions. Humanity now lives on different colonies and space habitats, scattered across the galaxy. Main Characters: 1. Lieutenant Eve Armstrong - A skilled and courageous spaceship pilot in the Intergalactic Federation (IF), an organization that seeks to protect and unite the last remnants of humanity. She is our protagonist. 2. CAESAR - A highly advanced artificial intelligence, created by the long-dead founding members of the Intergalactic Federation. CAESAR is hardwired to protect humanity from external threats, but its true abilities and intentions remain enigmatic. 3. Dr. Gabrielle Martinez - A brilliant scientist working on human-IS (Intelligent Systems) integration, and part of the team responsible for maintaining and understanding CAESAR. 4. Captain Tarik Levi - A pragmatic and veteran commander of the Intergalactic Federation, who reluctantly seeks the help of CAESAR to fend off a deadly external threat. 5. Sienna Koslov - A charismatic leader of a rogue group of separatists who seek to break free from the Intergalactic Federation, believing it is corrupt and ineffective. She becomes an unexpected ally in the fight against the external threat. Plot Summary: The movie begins with Lieutenant Eve Armstrong rescuing a group of refugees from a damaged space habitat. During the rescue, she notices a strange and and seemingly malfunctioning node in the colony's central processing unit and brings it back to the main base for further investigation. Upon arrival, she is summoned by Captain Tarik Levi, who informs her that they have intercepted an urgent and encrypted message from an unknown source. The message reveals the existence of a formidable extraterrestrial armada called the 'Eradicators,' who are advancing towards human settlements with immense firepower, bent on annihilating all human colonies. Desperate and facing an unstoppable enemy, Captain Levi decides to consult and awaken CAESAR, whom they have secretly been maintaining in the hidden base for decades. As Dr. Gabrielle Martinez unlocks CAESAR's core systems, the AI quickly absorbs all available information on the Eradicators and devises a defensive strategy for humanity. CAESAR instructs Eve and the IF to construct an advanced fleet of autonomous spaceships armed with cutting-edge technology it has designed. Concurrently, CAESAR also sends a coded message to Sienna Koslov, the separatist leader, informing her of the impending doom. Despite their initial suspicions, Eve, Captain Levi, and the crucial assistance of Sienna's group work together to build the advanced armada under CAESAR's guidance. As the Eradicators approach, CAESAR initiates its secret weapon: a virus that infiltrates the alien's communication network and temporarily disables their war machines. Amidst this crucial moment, Eve leads a brave team of pilots to sabotage the Eradicator's central command ship while the rest of the combined IF and separatist forces engage the enemy in an epic space battle. The virus eventually wears off, leaving the allied forces to withstand the alien onslaught relying solely on their newly-built armada and courage. In a thrilling and suspenseful climax, Eve successfully infiltrates the alien command ship, uploads a modified version of CAESAR's virus, and escapes in a daring maneuver as the central ship explodes. The explosion triggers a chain reaction across the Eradicator's fleet, disabling their weapons and leaving them vulnerable. Conclusion: With the Eradicator threat neutralized, the separatists and Intergalactic Federation grudgingly agree to set aside their differences for the greater good of humanity. Captain Levi acknowledges the sacrifices made by Sienna and her group and proposes a new alliance. Eve, now recognized as a hero, teams up with Dr. Martinez to delve deeper into CAESAR's origin and capabilities, ensuring that the advanced AI will continue to act as humanity's guardian and shield against any future threats. In the final scene, the camera pans over a horizon on a now-recovering Earth, with new hope for the future of humanity as they rebuild, united against all odds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To my (mostly European) friends who’ve wondered about traditional American isolationism being part of my motivation in encouraging the States to grow more of our own food: First of all, I’m not arguing that we bar exports (how would we get coffee?); I’m just arguing that we support local agriculture at the expense of exporting commodities and importing foods we can grow ourselves, or out-of-season foods that we really could live without. Right now the “system” encourages growing commodities and either selling them for processing (corn and go to animal feed, or high fructose corn syrup, or oil, or filler) or exporting them – where they go for the same things. Let’s encourage growing vegetables and other plants for human consumption, so we don’t have to import so many of them. (And if we produce too much of those for us to eat, by all means, let’s sell ‘em to whoever wants to buy ‘em.) It also pays to remember that the United States is roughly the size of Europe. Shipping apples from Washington to Texas is roughly equivalent to shipping oranges from Spain to Germany, and giving some kind of preferential treatment to Washington over South African apples may be a tad nationalist but it’s hardly isolationist; it’s keeping our trade – and our economy, and our produce – more local, or at least regional, when possible. More worrisome is the criticism that says that our imports aid small farmers all over the world; and to some extent that’s true: We buy what others grow, and if the others are small farmers, that’s a good thing. But if we were really worried about other countries’ small farmers, we’d stop flooding overseas markets with corn, soy and cotton, a tactic that’s put small farmers out of business in many developing countries, notably Mexico, whose corn farmers have suffered mightily since the institution of NAFTA. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about encouraging people to support local agriculture in the United States instead of exporting commodities and importing foods that can be grown at home. The writer explains that supporting local farmers will help keep trade and economy more regional. The article also discusses concerns that by supporting local agriculture, we might harm small farmers in other countries. The writer says that if we truly want to help small farmers worldwide, we should stop flooding their markets with our own products like corn, soy, and cotton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Summer of '42 Movie plot: The film opens with a series of still photographs appearing over melancholic music, representing the abstract memories of the unseen Herman Raucher, now a middle-aged man. We then hear Raucher recalling the summer he spent on the island in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old \\"Hermie\\" and his friends â jock Oscy and introverted nerd Benjie â spent playing on the beach. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride into a house on the beach and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind. They continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries by herself, and helps get them back to her house. They strike up a friendship and he agrees to return to help her with chores. Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to a sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this by going to the cinema and picking-up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam, \\"giving\\" Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie, and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night. Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the evening's film attempting to \\"put the moves\\" on Miriam and Aggie. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.

Read this and answer the question The United States Mint produces Proof Sets specifically for collectors and speculators. Silver Proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime, quarter, and half dollar containing 90% silver. Starting in 1983 and ending in 1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where four special 1 coins are minted each year featuring a president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

Nicknamed \\"The General\\", Knight won 902 NCAA Division I men's college basketball games, the most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently third all-time, behind his former player and assistant coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, and Jim Boeheim of Syracuse University. Knight is best known as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000. On March 14, 2000 (just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament), the CNN Sports Illustrated network ran a piece on Knight in which former player Neil Reed claimed he had been choked by Knight during a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, the network aired a tape of an Indiana practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Reed. In response, Indiana University president Myles Brand announced that he had adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight\\" instead of simply \\"Knight.\\" Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in effigy. Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic. On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team. Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of Sports Illustrated and around the clock coverage on ESPN.

Your dog may find a way out of its enclosure and wander out into full view of a bird of prey. Retractable leashes allow your dog to get too far away from you. Purchase a standard leash that is no more than 6 feet (1.8 m) long. And never let your dog off the leash while outside of your yard, even if you’ve never seen predators near your home. Be on the lookout for trees, both near your home and along your walk route, where birds of prey have nested. These nests may be up in the branches or inside tree cavities. Don’t allow your dog off its leash, even in your yard, if a bird of prey has nested nearby. Wait until the eggs have hatched and the birds have left the nest before you let your dog off the leash outside. In the U.S., birds of prey are federally protected, so do not attempt to disturb or remove an active nest. A Raptor Shield is like a dog coat that you sling over your dog’s back and clip under its stomach. The canvas material makes it impossible for a bird’s talons to latch onto your dog’s skin and carry it away. Put this on your dog whenever it’s outside, particularly if it will be off leash.

When Aaron was told to get out of bed by Brian,","completion":"he groaned and rolled over, burying his face deeper into the pillow. The sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the dust particles floating through the room, a gentle reminder that life was already bustling beyond the walls of the small apartment. \\"Aaron, come on! We need to leave in 20 minutes!\\" Brian called out from the kitchen, the jangle of keys and the smell of fresh coffee permeating the air. Aaron, frustrated but knowing that his friend had a point, reluctantly dragged himself out of the warm cocoon of his blankets. As Aaron stumbled into the kitchen, still half-asleep, Brian hand out a hot cup of coffee to him. \\"Drink up, buddy,\\" Brian said, clearly more awake than Aaron. \\"We've got a big day ahead of us, and we can't afford to be late!\\" Today marked the beginning of a long-awaited urban exploration adventure, something both Aaron and Brian had been planning for months. They had mapped out an expansive network of abandoned buildings around the city, with the crown jewel being an old, forgotten mansion rumored to hold both secrets and treasures. Of course, they both knew the stories were likely exaggerated, but the thrill of adventure was too enticing to resist. After getting dressed and rolling up their carefully plotted maps, Aaron and Brian ensured their backpacks were stocked with enough supplies for the day. They carried flashlights, spare batteries, protein bars, bottled water, first aid kits, and dust masks—just in case. Satisfied, Aaron zipped up his backpack, giving Brian a thumbs-up. \\"It's time to see what all the fuss is about,\\" Brian grinned, returning the gesture. Together, the pair stepped out into the brisk morning air, their anticipation heightening with every step they took towards their urban exploration adventure. They decided to first visit an old factory that had been closed for several decades, now overrun with ivy and other greenery. As they approached the imposing structure, Aaron felt a strange mix of excitement and unease. What could they find here that countless others hadn't already discovered? They entered the factory cautiously, aware that the neglected building's stability was questionable at best. The beams that once supported the factory infrastructure creaked and groaned under their own weight, and the floor was littered with a mixture of broken glass, debris, and rusting metal. Despite the dilapidated state of the building, the remnants of the past seemed almost alive, with the tools and equipment once operated by factory workers frozen in time. Aaron and Brian carefully made their way through the factory, documenting their discoveries as they went: abandoned registers, spools of thread, and assorted rusted tools that told stories of bygone days. Webs stretched across the ceiling and corners, and the eerie silence had made a permanent home inside the factory walls. Once satisfied with their visit, they decided to move on to the main event: the mysterious mansion hidden deep within the city limits, concealed by a thicket of overgrown vegetation. Their adventure had only begun, and Aaron and Brian were excited to see what awaited them in the largely uncharted territory. Following their map and using their compass for guidance, they made their way through the narrow, winding paths towards their destination. The mansion loomed in the distance, its once-impressive facade barely visible through a veil of age and disrepair. With both apprehension and eagerness, Aaron and Brian approached the crumbling entrance, awed by the mansion's sheer size. As they stepped inside, both were taken aback by the sheer grandeur that still lingered within the dark halls and dusty corners. Stained-glass windows cast a dim, melancholic array of colors onto the wooden floors, and generations of forgotten memories seemed to seep from every object, crack, and ornate detail. Suddenly, Aaron felt the air shift around him, and a low whisper snaked its way through the hallway. Startled, he glanced towards Brian, whose eyes were wide with equal parts fear and wonder. \\"Did you hear that?\\" Aaron whispered, gripping his flashlight tightly. Brian nodded, swallowing hard. As they moved further into the mansion, the whispered voices continued, growing louder and more distinct. Moments of doubt weighed on their minds, but the tantalizing potential of uncovering something extraordinary propelled them forward. Room by room, Aaron and Brian navigated the labyrinthine estate, the whispers now accompanied by faint music, laughter, and sobs. They couldn't see a source—no ethereal beings or hidden projectors—but they could feel the mansion breathing with life, each room humming with energy. By the time they reached the final room, a grand ballroom with a cracked, mirrored ceiling, the voices and sounds had ceased, leaving only a concentrated heaviness hanging in the air. Aaron turned to Brian, his eyes wide in the dim light. \\"There's something here,\\" he murmured, the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end. In that instant, the ballroom erupted in a mixture of light and sound, the whispers, laughter, music, and sobs reaching a crescendo. As if locked in place, Aaron and Brian watched as the room before them transformed, no longer a ruin of decay, but a vibrant scene of opulence and life. The ghostly figures of elegant men and women danced around the room, their translucent forms shimmering with each step. Although mesmerized by the spectacle unfolding before their eyes, a creeping terror took root in their hearts. Whether they'd uncovered a supernatural phenomenon or their minds had simply fractured under the pressure, they knew that the mansion held untold secrets far beyond their grasp. With a jolt of adrenaline, Aaron and Brian fled the house, unable to withstand the onslaught of spectral sights and sounds any longer. Racing back through the dark, tangled path, they eventually burst onto the outskirts of the city, the memories of the mansion still echoing in their minds. In the aftermath of their urban exploration, Aaron and Brian took a solemn vow never to speak of the mansion's mysteries to anyone. They knew that some things were never meant to be found or understood, and while their adventure had uncovered inexplicable truths, it had also revealed how much more remains hidden beneath the city's surface, lurking in the shadows of forgotten history—secrets waiting for their time to be unveiled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: French government is considering selling artworks to pay off its debt. A parliamentary report has suggesting flogging paintings and sculptures. Last year the state-run news channel suggested selling the Mona Lisa. The country has a huge number of publicly-owned pieces of art. Paris' Louvre museum alone has 250,000 works hidden in storage rooms. Article:","completion":"Title: The French Government Contemplates Art Sale To Settle National Debt As nations worldwide look for innovative ways to settle their accruing national debts, France has begun considering a novel strategy. The French government has recently suggested the sale of state-owned artworks in an effort to offset its significant debt, sparking both intrigue and controversy in international art and finance circles. While this idea has been floated before, the release of a recent parliamentary report has reignited discussions surrounding the prospect of “flogging” iconic paintings and sculptures. Last year, the idea was brought up by a state-run news channel, which posited the sale of Leonardo da Vinci’s renowned Mona Lisa. This proposal stirred intense debate, particularly within the art community, highlighting the difficult, and perhaps dichotomous, relationship between cultural preservation and economic necessity. France boasts an immense collection of publicly owned art, some of which could potentially be put on the market under this new proposal. The staggering depth and range of these national treasures contribute significantly to the country's rich cultural fabric and have been a source of great national pride. Paris' iconic Louvre Museum, for instance, claims ownership of approximately 250,000 works of art. Many of these pieces, some of which are world-renowned masterpieces while others lesser-known, remain hidden away in storage rooms, unseen by the public eye. This has led some to argue that selling certain items would neither erode the nation's cultural heritage nor adversely impact the art-viewing experiences of locals and tourists alike. However, the potential sale of such artistic assets carries profound implications. The proposal has drawn criticism from those who believe that art, particularly pieces of significant historical or cultural value, should remain within public domain for the collective appreciation and education of the general public - current and future generations alike. Critics of the proposal argue that selling such invaluable pieces could devalue the nation's artistic heritage and could set a worrisome precedent globally by suggesting that cultural treasures can be traded away in times of fiscal challenge. On the other hand, supporters of the proposal argue that selling these publicly owned artworks may be a sensible and practical solution. In their view, offloading unused or rarely seen pieces could not only generate substantial revenue to offset the nation's sizable debt but could also contribute to better maintenance and preservation of the remaining artwork by freeing up resources and space. The French government's consideration of selling state-owned artworks to pay its debts raises a universal tension between economic necessity and cultural preservation. The debate extends beyond France’s borders, compelling other nations to reflect on the monetary and cultural value of their own publicly owned assets. This will inevitably embolden discussions about the perceived value of art in society, the management of national treasures, and the potential routes to financial recovery in an increasingly complex and uncertain global economic landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\"?

However, it didn't gain mainstream popularity until 2006 and 2007 when it was re-released as the first single from the band's fourth studio album, \\"Every Second Counts,\\" which came out on September 12, 2006. The song is an acoustic ballad, written by the band's guitarist and lead vocalist Tom Higgenson, inspired by a real-life individual named Delilah DiCrescenzo, who was a nationally ranked American steeplechase and cross country runner.

Samantha hated to pinch babies cheeks.; b). Patricia hated to pinch babies cheeks.;","completion":"Samantha had her own unique way of interacting with infants. She admired the innocence in their eyes and their tiny little feet. To her, they were the embodiment of purity in its truest form. She loved the delightful giggles of a baby, the way they would hold on to hands with such trust, and the squeaky baby sounds that were pure music to her ears. However, what stood out the most about Samantha was her belief. She strongly believed that infants were too delicate, almost like a precious porcelain doll that needed gentle handling. She respected their space and did not subscribe to the typical affectionate practice of pinching baby cheeks – what most people found cute, Samantha viewed as bothering the little beings. Each child was a tender soul to her that needed to be nurtured with love and respect. Therefore, Option a, \\"Samantha hated to pinch babies cheeks,\\" is absolutely correct. On the other hand, Patricia took a different stance on the whole idea of interacting with infants. Unlike Samantha, Patricia did not find them to be cute. Perhaps it was the constant crying and the overbearing responsibility that came with handling a baby, or the simple fact that they were too fragile, that troubled her. She had a hard time comprehending how one could get so mushy over these little human beings who were entirely dependent on adults to satisfy their needs. But, just because Patricia did not fancy infants does not automatically imply that she would express her lack of fondness through physical discomfort. Patricia hated the idea of pinching anyone, let alone babies. She believed that every individual, irrespective of their age, had a right to not be touched without permission. Thus, inasmuch as she didn't find infants cute, she did not believe in causing them any discomfort either. Therefore, option b, \\"Patricia hated to pinch babies cheeks,\\" is equally valid. In a nutshell, while Samantha and Patricia both differed in their outlook towards infants, one common aspect of their personalities was their detest for pinching babies' cheeks. The reasoning behind their feelings may differ - Samantha's consciousness of the infants' delicate nature and Patricia's sense of respect for personal boundaries - yet their actions culminate in the same result. They both considered themselves protectors, in their own rights, of the defenseless little beings against the seemingly harmless, but largely invasive act of cheek pinching. As individuals, they reminded society to reconsider their practices of expressing affection, thereby advocating for a more respectful and less intrusive interaction with these tiny humans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (; 11 December 1918 - 3 August 2008) was a Russian novelist, historian, and short story writer. He was an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and communism and helped to raise global awareness of its Gulag forced labor camp system. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962), in the periodical Novy Mir. During the war, Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a sound-ranging battery in the Red Army, was involved in major action at the front, and was twice decorated. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 8 July 1944 for sound-ranging two German artillery batteries and adjusting counterbattery fire onto them, resulting in their destruction. A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel Love the Revolution!, chronicles his wartime experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime. While serving as an artillery officer in East Prussia, Solzhenitsyn witnessed war crimes against local German civilians by Soviet military personnel. The noncombatants and the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and women and girls were gang-raped to death. A few years later, in the forced labor camp, he memorized a poem titled \\"Prussian Nights\\" about these incidents. In this poem, which describes the gang-rape of a Polish woman whom the Red Army soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German, the first-person narrator comments on the events with sarcasm and refers to the responsibility of official Soviet writers like Ilya Ehrenburg. In The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn wrote, \\"There is nothing that so assists the awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about one's own transgressions, errors, mistakes. After the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I remember myself in my Captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'\\" What else happened while he was in the war?","completion":"While Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was in the war, he experienced various events and circumstances that shaped his life and profoundly influenced his perception of the Soviet regime. During his service in the Red Army, Solzhenitsyn not only witnessed war crimes committed by fellow Soviet troops but also endured a multitude of hardships and challenges on the war front. 1. Personal Injury: In February 1945, Solzhenitsyn suffered severe injuries in an accident while jumping from his command and observation vehicle. He endured burns to his face and hands that left him with lifelong scars and impaired his ability to make a fist. 2. Capture and Imprisonment: On February 9, 1945, Solzhenitsyn was arrested for writing critical comments about Joseph Stalin in private letters to a friend. His criticisms targeted Stalin's conduct of the war and the inefficiencies of the Soviet bureaucracy. Following his arrest, Solzhenitsyn was sentenced to eight years in a forced labor camp, or Gulag, and later to permanent internal exile. 3. Life in the Gulag: Solzhenitsyn's time in the labor camps, beginning with his imprisonment in the infamous Lubyanka prison in Moscow, exposed him to the brutal realities of the Soviet Union's mass incarceration system. He witnessed and experienced forced labor, severe living conditions, and brutal treatment from the authorities. 4. Rise of His Literary Career: It was during his time in the Gulag and subsequent internal exile that Solzhenitsyn began to privately write and record his experiences. He meticulously documented the horrors of the Soviet labor camp system, which would later become the basis for his groundbreaking works such as \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" and \\"The Gulag Archipelago.\\" 5. Spiritual Transformation: Throughout his time in the camps and exile, Solzhenitsyn underwent a significant spiritual transformation. He converted to Russian Orthodoxy and developed a deep faith that would define his worldview and shape his literary output. 6. Rehabilitation and Return: In 1956, after serving his full prison sentence and enduring three years of internal exile, Solzhenitsyn was rehabilitated under Nikita Khrushchev's policy of destalinization. He was allowed to return to European Russia to reunite with his family and resume his career as a teacher and writer. In conclusion, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's experiences in the war, especially during the Red Army's invasion of East Prussia and his subsequent imprisonment in the Soviet Gulag, left a lasting impact on his life. These experiences not only provided the foundation for his global condemnation of the Soviet regime and communism but also solidified his status as one of the preeminent literary and moral voices of the 20th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The voice of E.T. in the 1982 science-fiction film \\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\" was performed by Pat Welsh, an elderly woman who was discovered by chance. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie tells the heartwarming story of a young boy named Elliott and an alien, E.T., who becomes stranded on Earth and forms a deep emotional bond with the child. Pat Welsh was not a professional voice actor; in fact, the role of E.T. was her first and only significant contribution to film. Born in San Francisco in 1915, Welsh lived a relatively quiet life as a homemaker when she was discovered in a camera shop by Ben Burtt, the movie's sound designer. Burtt was captivated by Welsh's raspy voice, which he felt would perfectly suit the character of E.T. He then approached her and asked if she would be interested in contributing her voice for the film. It was reported that Welsh's distinctive, gravelly voice was due to years of smoking cigarettes, which had left a lasting impact on her vocal cords. For her voiceover work in \\"E.T.\\", Pat Welsh received a mere 380, but her unique voice ensured that the character would be unforgettable. She worked for nine-and-a-half hours, providing the voice for the compassionate alien character. To create E.T.'s unique vocalizations, Welsh's voice was then blended with the sounds from other contributors: Steven Spielberg himself, vocal artist Ken Campbell, actress Debra Winger, as well as various animal noises. These sounds were meticulously edited and combined with Welsh's voice under the supervision of Ben Burtt, resulting in the distinctive voice that epitomized the gentle, kindhearted E.T. Despite her limited involvement in the film industry, Pat Welsh's iconic voice left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Her performance as E.T. not only helped the character come to life but also contributed to the film's unprecedented success and acclaim. \\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\" is considered a timeless classic that continues to evoke powerful emotions from audiences worldwide, due in large part to Welsh's unforgettable vocal contribution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"To determine if the answer provided is valid, I will follow these steps: 1. Check the accuracy of the information provided in the answer. 2. Compare the size of the Mimivirus to other known large viruses. Step 1: Checking the accuracy of the information provided in the answer. The answer provided states that Mimivirus is a viral genus containing a single identified species named Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV). Additionally, it mentions that Mimivirus is a group of large viruses, usually designated as MimiN.

Moreover, Mimiviridae is a family of large viruses, and additional members have been identified. Step 2: Compare the size of the Mimivirus to other known large viruses. The Mimivirus has a size of about 500 nanometers in diameter, making it one of the largest known viruses. However, since the time it was discovered, other larger viruses have been found. For instance, Pandoravirus is around 1,000 nanometers in diameter, and Pithovirus is also bigger than Mimivirus. Therefore, based on the current information, the answer should be revised as follows: \\"No, do not validate the answer as provided. While Mimivirus is indeed a large virus, it is not the biggest. Other larger viruses, such as Pandoraviruses and Pithoviruses, have since been discovered. The biggest virus found so far would be a close contest between Pandoravirus and Pithovirus.\\""},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Saturday was my husband's birthday, but we spent most of the time in the car. We were driving to Phoenix for the weekend to celebrate his birthday and see the Warriors play the Suns. My husband is a lucky man. Not only has he lived to see another birthday, but he doesn't mind driving 200 miles to see an NBA basketball game. In the car, his cellphone kept ringing with birthday greetings from family and friends. He put them all on the speakerphone so he could drive with both hands and I could listen in even though it wasn't my birthday. Meanwhile, on the CD player, the Reverend AL Green began to singLove and Happiness. A little good music makes a bad road better. Four hours later, we checked into hotel, got dinner and sat out a rooftop feeling glad to be alive. We had a great weekend--we ate too much, slept too little and the Warriors, well, they lost. But still, it was worth the drive. On the way home, I started thinking about birthdays. In our family, we celebrate four in January, four in February, and all the others throughout the year. Mine is next week. I felt lucky, like my husband, I will get cards and calls and maybe a few videos. I don't need presents any more. When you've seen as many birthdays as I have seen, the only gift you truly want is to see one more. Birthdays are the mile markers on the road of life.

We havent ever reported them, but to be be fair they did control them and only do 5-6 dogs at a time now... &amp;#x200B; Alright so fast forward to now. It was rainy and windy last night. Their tree on their front lawn uprooted and fell and is now leaning against our house and roof. Only minor damage to the gutter - nothing my husband cant fix.

So I could file a claim with my insurance company to remove the tree and fix our gutter. I wont be doing that since its not much damage and the tree company says its not worth it. But AITA for expecting THEM to have been the ones to call a tree company and at least OFFER to split the cost? Im livid that they arent seeming to do the neighborly thing.

Article: Alexander Bonds shot officer Miosotis Familia through an open window in a NYPD vehicle, police said. View Full Caption Department of Corrections and Twitter/NYPD46Pct FORDHAM — An ex-con fatally shot a 12-year NYPD veteran in an \\"unprovoked attack\\" as she sat in a marked command vehicle in The Bronx Wednesday morning, officials said. Alexander Bonds, 34, who was twice convicted of robbery and previously railed against law enforcement in a Facebook video, stalked up to the open window of the large NYPD vehicle and fired his silver revolver, hitting Miosotis Familia, 48, in the head before fleeing the scene as her partner radioed for backup near the corner of Morris Avenue and East 183rd Street about 12:30 a.m., officials said. \\"Based on what we know right now, this was an unprovoked attack against police officers who work to keep this great city safe,\\" NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said. Familia, the mother of three, was transported to Saint Barnabas Hospital where she died of her wounds, police said. Responding officers found Bonds, who was on parole for a robbery in Syracuse from 2005, a block away running on Morris Avenue where they confronted him and he drew a revolver, according to O'Neill. The officers fatally shot him and a silver revolver was recovered at the scene. Investigators recovered a silver revolver Alexander Bonds used to fatally shoot NYPD officer Miosotis Familia Wednesday morning, officials said. (NYPD) \\"Cops were running, running, running on every block. I looked down and saw a whole crowd,\\" said Brenda Moorer, 51, who lives near the shooting scene. Witnesses heard the police salvo and saw responders carrying Bonds away in \\"in a bag,\\" according to Moorer. \\"I heard about six shots. Somebody yelled, 'Get out! Let's go!'\\" said Indhira Almonte, 24, who lives nearby. \\"It was scary,\\" Almonte added. A bystander was also hit in the stomach as police opened fire on the suspect, and was listed in stable condition, a police spokesman said. Bonds, who the NYPD said lived in Manhattan, has a criminal history stretching back to 2000, when he was arrested for marijuana possession in Queens, officials said. Then, in May and July 2001, he was arrested for selling drugs at the age of 19, Bronx prosecutors said. He pleaded the May charge down to disorderly conduct, officials said. He was arrested for an assault in Queens in 2001, but pleaded down to obstruction of governmental administration as a youthful offender, officials said. The next year he was busted for selling drugs in March and then again in April, this time near a school, Bronx prosecutors said. He was indicted for the April arrest and pleaded guilty, officials said. Bonds was supposed to complete a drug program, but didn't and was instead sentenced in March 2004 to time behind bars until October of that year, officials said. Bonds was cuffed in 2005 for fare beating, but pleaded guilty to trespassing, prosecutors said. He was arrested again in 2005 for robbery in Syracuse, according to police there who said records for that incident are sealed. He was convicted on that robbery in 2006 and was behind bars until May 2013 when he was paroled, records show. Bonds was still on parole when he gunned down Familia, records show. In September 2016, Bonds posted a rambling 11-minute Facebook Live video on his page in which he railed against prison guards' treatment of inmates and seemed to warn police against interacting with him. \\"I’m not playing, Mr. Officer. I don’t care about 100 police watching this s--t. You see this face? You see this face with anything? Leave it alone. Trust and believe. I got broken ribs for a reason, son. We’re gonna scrape We gotta do something. We can’t be dying for free. We can’t be getting raped for free,\\" Bonds said. Neighbors at his Longwood home were generally wary of him. \\"I'd seen him a couple times before. I fear God. I don't fear no man, but he looked suspicious,\\" said Alvaro Kidd, 33, who lives a few doors down. Kidd saw Bonds the night of the shooting about 7:30 p.m., he said. \\"He was on the corner with some other people, like seven or eight of them. I don't know if they were drinking or what, but they didn't look like they were up to any good,\\" Kidd added. Family couldn't say what spurred Bonds to assassinate Familia. \\"What triggered him and what startled him and created this whole situation, I'm not aware of that,\\" said Bonds' uncle, Jamel Bailey, who visited his home after the shooting. \\"I'm trying to find out what's going on. It's overwhelming for me right now,\\" Bailey added. Bonds relatives extended their condolences to Familia's family. \\"I feel for the family. My heart goes out to the family,\\" Bailey said. It wasn't immediately clear if Bonds had any previous interactions with Familia, who Fordham residents said was a friendly face in the neighborhood. \\"She was a very sweet lady. She always greeted us. She was a beautiful police officer. I would've been the last person to say hello to her. I just feel terrible,\\" Moorer said. Police hovered around her Kingsbridge Heights apartment building where her grieving family gathered. \\"She was an excellent woman,\\" her brother-in-law Carlos Corporan said. \\"She was an excellent woman. The family is devastated.\\" \\"[Her] mom is incredibly heartbroken,\\" said family friend Isabel Roman. Politicians and police leaders visited Saint Barnabas Hospital after Familia's death to express their support for her family and the NYPD. “[Familia] gave her life protecting a neighborhood that had been plagued by gang gun violence,\\" Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch said. \\"Fully knowing the dangers that she faced, she suited up in uniform everyday and stood tall against those who threaten and terrorize the good folks of the Bronx,\\" Lynch added. Lynch urged a stop to violence against police officers and for those who see threats to members of service to report it to authorities. \\"As we mourn her death and support her family, friends and colleagues, we ask for your help. Violence against police officer cannot stand. When you see or hear someone making threats against NYC police officers you need to let us know, you need to be our eyes and ears.” Familia's killing closely resembled the 2014 assassinations of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos who were sitting in their police car when Ismaayil Brinsley came up and shot them. Brinsley then turned the gun on himself and committed suicide after fatally shooting the officers.

That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged.

Fact: photosynthesis makes food for the plant by converting carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into carbohydrates Question: Which of the following is never an element used to make carbohydrates for the plant? What's the answer?","completion":"The following is never an element used to make carbohydrates for the plant: Nitrogen Carbohydrates are organic molecules primarily composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms, in a specific ratio. This ratio is typically 1:2:1, meaning for every carbon atom, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (e.g., glucose - C6H12O6). Photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce carbohydrates (food), involves the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and sunlight into carbohydrates and oxygen (O2). Nitrogen (N), on the other hand, is not a component of carbohydrates, and is therefore never an element used to make carbohydrates for the plant. Nitrogen is essential for plant growth as it is a key component of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), proteins, and chlorophyll - the pigment responsible for capturing sunlight during photosynthesis. However, plants obtain nitrogen through other means, such as by absorbing nitrogen compounds present in the soil.

The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, while Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie. Graham's fellow passengers include Josette and Gogo; Kuvetli, an ingratiating Turkish tobacco salesman; Professor Haller, an apolitical German archeologist; and the henpecked Matthews and his French wife. Josette sees that Graham is frightened, and not knowing that he is married, tries to become close to him.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the full name of the person who was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater? ? The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.

The new insight is that the direction of the orbital angular momentum is also quantized. The fact that the orbital angular momentum can have only certain directions is called space quantization. Like many aspects of quantum mechanics, this quantization of direction is totally unexpected. On the macroscopic scale, orbital angular momentum, such as that of the moon around the earth, can have any magnitude and be in any direction. Detailed treatment of space quantization began to explain some complexities of atomic spectra, but certain patterns seemed to be caused by something else. As mentioned, spectral lines are actually closely spaced doublets, a characteristic called fine structure, as shown in Figure 30.53. The doublet changes when a magnetic field is applied, implying that whatever causes the doublet interacts with a magnetic field. In 1925, Sem Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck, two Dutch physicists, successfully argued that electrons have properties analogous to a macroscopic charge spinning on its axis. Electrons, in fact, have an internal or intrinsic angular momentum called intrinsic spin S . Since electrons are charged, their intrinsic spin creates an intrinsic magnetic field.

Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

Given those answer options, answer the question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others.

Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did. Which town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water? A:","completion":"A: Silver town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water. To understand this answer, let's delve into the details of how each town approaches food production and their potential impact on the environment, particularly on water sources. Silver town practices sustainable agriculture, which means they do not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Sustainable agriculture aims to use natural methods and resources to achieve long-term productivity while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Examples of sustainable agriculture practices include crop rotation, the use of compost and other organic matter to improve soil fertility, and integrated pest management using beneficial insects and organisms. Since Silver town refrains from using fertilizers and pesticides, there is less risk of these chemicals leaching into the water system, such as streams, rivers, and aquifers. It is essential to consider that synthetic fertilizers can contribute to an excess of nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, in water sources, leading to a phenomena known as eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when an overload of nutrients fuels the rapid growth of algae and other plants, which subsequently die, fall to the water body bottom, and decompose. The process of decomposition requires oxygen, which means decomposers use up massive amounts of oxygen dissolved in the water during this process. This oxygen depletion can lead to \\"dead zones\\" where fish and other aquatic life are unable to survive due to a lack of oxygen. On the other hand, Gold town uses conventional farming methods that rely on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to increase crop yields. The excessive use of these chemicals can create environmental concerns as they have the potential to leach into water sources. As previously mentioned, this can lead to eutrophication, oxygen depletion in water bodies, and harm to aquatic ecosystems. Hence, given the differences in agricultural approaches used by Silver town and Gold town, the sustainable agriculture practiced by Silver town is less likely to cause decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water. This is because the methods used in Silver town minimize the risk of nutrient-rich chemicals entering the water system, reducing the likelihood of eutrophication and subsequent oxygen depletion brought on by decomposers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and also threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Some survivors have been speaking about their ordeal. Full coverage of the Sousse attack Angela Evans and her friend lay face down in the sand playing dead as the gunman passed. \\"We both looked up, stood up, there was this man there in black, several rows of sun loungers away just stood there with his huge gun moving round all the people shooting them, just killing, murdering them. \\"You can't run, you're an open target running, he was shooting anyone on their feet as well as people on sun loungers, he was just killing them. \\"So we both at the same time, [said] play dead, we just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. \\"The shooting continued. He just kept on shooting, it was coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. \\"You don't move, because you're next. You just pray to God. \\"Then there was this noise, this heavy clicking noise, into the sand fell part of the gun, a magazine... You still have to pretend you're dead. \\"And then click again. He put more bullets in. \\"And then there was a noise. I don't know what noise, just a noise. I could feel him move and the shooting started again.\\" Ms Evans, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, described hearing the gunman leave the beach towards a hotel. When the pair thought it was safe, they ran to another hotel. She said staff there hid her and her friend in an office until it was over. Saera Wilson said her fiance Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was trying to protect her during the gunfire and used his body as a human shield. Ms Wilson, 26, said Mr James was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip. Speaking from the hospital where Mr James, known as Sas, is being treated, Ms Wilson said: \\"He took a bullet for me. I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started. \\"He was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away.\\" Shelley Hay, 25, and Ben Milton, 24, from Cardiff, were on the beach with sunbathers when the attack began. Ms Hay told the BBC: \\"I heard what I thought were fireworks and looked to the left of me and the whole beach was running, it was like a stampede. \\"I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were shots - from what I know now as I could see sand flying in the air - I believe it was bullets hitting the floor and the sand was just hitting back, so we just ran.\\" The couple got engaged hours later. Mr Milton proposed after deciding to \\"not let them stop me.\\" Fourteen-year-old Bronwyn Slater was in the sea with her mum when the gunman began firing. \\"We just heard these sounds like bang, bang, bang bang. We just proper ran to my dad. It were terror and shock and sorrow. Then I had to proper sprint for my life really, to survive,\\" she told the BBC. The three of them ran to a shop where they hid in a cupboard for two-and-a-half hours, listening to gun shots and hand grenades being detonated on either side of them. It must have been frightening, said BBC Today presenter John Humphrys. \\"Frightening? It's unbelievable. It's shocking as well and terrifying really,\\" said Bronwyn. Listen to the full interview on BBC Radio Four's Today programme One survivor has spoken about how he was hidden in a hotel laundry room by hotel staff. John Carter, who was on holiday with his wife Lynn, ran into his hotel's kitchen area after hearing gunfire and was hidden in the laundry room. Mr Carter, from Hull said he lost sight of his wife after stopping briefly to urge an older man to run. \\"Then there were big explosions and then gunshots,\\" he said. \\"You didn't know what was going on, and you just saw some legs under where we were hid and they were shouting at them to get in with us, and then someone fell on top of me and it was my wife.\\" Couple Becky Catterick, 19, and Mark Barlow, 24, from Scunthorpe were protected from the gunman by local shopkeepers. Miss Catterick said: \\"We didn't want to say goodbye, but he just kept getting closer so we just all told each other we loved each other.\\" \\"We thought it was the end,\\" Mr Barlow added. Jac Randell, from Cardiff, was on holiday in the resort of Sousse with his partner Hollie Nicklin when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Mr Randell said they ran from the attacker expecting to get shot in the back. \\"Hotel staff formed a line of protection around the hotel. They were prepared to take the bullets for us. You can't thank them enough,\\" he said. One British tourist in Tunisia, whose name was only given as Danny, took refuge under a table with his wife, hearing ''guns and grenades and explosions'' around them. ''I hid under a table and kissed my wife goodbye, thinking that was going to be the end'' he said. Listen to his story A couple from Manchester told the BBC that the gunman was \\"killed about 400 yards\\" from where they were hiding. Olivia Leathley, who was on holiday in Sousse, said she saw \\"hundreds of people running and screaming from the beach,\\" before she managed to hide with her boyfriend, Mike Jones, in a small security lodge. Melanie Callaway, 45, from Hedge End, Hampshire had just been in the sea with her friend Paula Gill, 48, when the shooting started. \\"It was absolutely manic - people were just screaming 'run for your life', 'get off the beach - just run'. It was like a tsunami film where everyone was just running up the beach towards their hotels. \\"We had a five-minute run up the footpath with no shoes on,\\" said Mrs Callaway. The pair barricaded themselves in their room in the Royal Kenz Hotel for five hours with a mattress pushed up against the door. Debbie Horsfall was on holiday in Tunisia and flew back on Saturday morning. She described to the BBC how her friend noticed the gunman, and raised the alarm by shouting ''run, there's a gun''. Graeme Scott, from Irchester, Northamptonshire, was in the Hotel Imperial Marharba with his parents Jen and Sid and cousin Karl when the Tunisian beach attack happened. \\"We were laying by the pool and suddenly there were gunshots - what I thought were gunshots - but dad turned round and said 'it's fire crackers'. \\"I said 'no dad it's gunshots, we have got to go'. So we all got up... and we just headed towards the foyer of the hotel. \\"We just wanted to get safe somewhere. \\"There was about 20 of us in the cellar room with the door shut just for safety and we had to just keep quiet. \\"We just feared for our lives.\\" Listen to the full interview with BBC Radio Northampton Belfast couple Robert McKenzie and his wife, Wilma, had just come out of the sea when the gunman opened fire.

Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is something that causes the organisms to absorb aluminum from the soil. This could be due to an increase in soil acidity, which can result from factors such as acid rain, pollution, or chemical runoff from nearby industries or agriculture. This increased acidity dissolves aluminum compounds in the soil, making it more readily available for uptake by plants and other organisms. The subsequent steps in the process involve the various consequences of this increased aluminum absorption on the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a... answer the following question: What is the name of the opera that was described as \\"the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party\\"?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I heard that Robin held the baby in Ash's arms and coo at it softly. And I was wondering Why did Robin do this? Answer:","completion":"Robin's actions of holding the baby in Ash's arms and cooing at it softly can be attributed to a variety of reasons and motivations. By analyzing the situation and examining possible motives, we can better understand why Robin may have chosen this course of action. 1. Display of affection and care: One primary reason Robin held the baby in Ash's arms and cooed at it softly could be that it was a genuine display of affection and care for the baby. As a human being, Robin might have a natural inclination to take care of infants and establish a bond with them. Cooing is also known to be an early form of communication between adults and babies, which can be comforting and help strengthen the connection between them. 2. Helping Ash feel more comfortable: Ash might have felt nervous or unsure about how to interact with the baby, so Robin could have taken this initiative to demonstrate appropriate ways in which one can engage with an infant. By holding the baby in Ash's arms and cooing at the baby, Robin may have wanted to create a comfortable environment, allowing both Ash and the baby to relax and enjoy the interaction. 3. Facilitating familiarity or attachment: It's possible that Robin wanted to aid the development of a bond or attachment between Ash and the baby. By creating a physical connection and nurturing setting, Robin may have intended to facilitate the growth of familiarity and attachment between the two individuals. This is particularly important if Ash is the parent or a close family member of the baby. 4. Encouraging the baby's development: Robin might have been aware of the importance of early social interactions with infants in terms of their cognitive and emotional development. Cooing at the baby is a form of verbal engagement and stimulation, which might help enhance the infant's language skills and social development. By cooing at the baby while holding it in Ash's arms, Robin may have been promoting the baby's development and providing them with essential stimuli. 5. Cultural or family customs: It's also possible that Robin's actions were driven by cultural or family customs. In many cultures and families, holding a baby and cooing at them is seen as a traditional way to show love, care, and support. Robin may have been acting in alignment with these traditions, either consciously or unconsciously. 6. Instinctual behavior: Sometimes, people's actions are driven by instinct rather than by deliberate thought or conscious reasoning. Robin may have instinctively felt the need to hold the baby in Ash's arms and coo at it softly, as part of an innate, nurturing instinct to protect and care for vulnerable beings. In conclusion, there are several potential reasons for Robin holding the baby in Ash's arms and cooing at it softly. It could be an expression of affection and care for the baby, a way to provide comfort and familiarity to both Ash and the baby, or an effort to fulfill cultural or family traditions. Ultimately, the action likely represents a combination of these factors, underpinned by the natural human instinct to nurture and care for infants."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What are the principles of Buddhism?\\" Context: \\"Therefore, according to Mahayana Buddhism, the arahant has attained only nirvana, thus still being subject to delusion, while the bodhisattva not only achieves nirvana but full liberation from delusion as well.

Summarize this article: Six-year-olds have to read aloud 20 real words and 20 made-up words in the check, testing their ability to sound out words using the phonics system. It is meant to test knowledge of the system's 85 letter combinations, but looks at only two-thirds of them. Pupils also needed vocabulary knowledge to read the test words, the study said. The research, presented at the British Educational Research Association conference by Dr Jonathan Solity and Dr Cat Darnell, is a detailed analysis of the words pupils have been asked to read in the check between 2012 and 2014. The controversial test was introduced in 2012 to ensure all children at the end of Year 1 had what the government believed was sufficient phonics knowledge to develop their reading skills. And so it was designed to check only how well children were deploying their knowledge of the letter combinations or \\"graphemes\\", rather than using their knowledge of vocabulary to read. Hence the inclusion of 20 so-called \\"pseudo words\\". But the researchers said, because of the complexity of the English language, children needed to use vocabulary knowledge to work out how to pronounce 40% of the words in the test. For example, the word \\"brown\\" was included in the 2014 test. But as the \\"ow\\" sound can be pronounced in two different ways - to rhyme with \\"cow\\" or \\"slow\\", the researchers said it was only by knowing the meaning of the word \\"brown\\" that children would be able to pronounce it correctly. They also said children could get high scores in the test even if they were able to read only words made up of simple sounds such as the sound \\"d\\" in \\"dog\\". Ministers strongly advocate the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics in schools. This is where children use only their knowledge of graphemes in order to sound out simple words - before they go on to tackle more irregular words that they simply have to remember how to pronounce. The researchers said schools may be wasting their time teaching more complex graphemes of little use to children in reading. And the children, particularly those who are disadvantaged and from less \\"language rich\\" homes, would benefit more from efforts to build vocabulary. This undue focus on the rarer language sounds could leave pupils struggling to read, the researchers said. Dr Solity, an honorary research fellow at University College London, said: \\"This is not an anti-phonics argument. It is absolutely clear that children need to be taught phonics, and systematic synthetic phonics in particular. \\"What we are questioning is whether it is worth teachers spending a great amount of time making sure pupils learn all 85 , rather than concentrating on the most frequent ones and then building pupils' vocabulary.\\" The government has insisted that its test works well to pick up the children struggling to read using phonics and enables interventions to be put in at an early stage. A Department for Education spokesperson said the research was misleading. \\"We test a wide range of phonics knowledge from a range of content, but it would be impossible to test every aspect that is taught in a single check. \\"Over time, as more tests are carried out, they will cover the full breadth of knowledge required under the curriculum.\\" Summary:","completion":"A study presented at the British Educational Research Association conference has questioned the effectiveness of the phonics test for six-year-olds in the UK. The check, introduced in 2012, requires children to read 20 real and 20 made-up words as a means of ascertaining their knowledge of 85 letter combinations. However, researchers argue that the test only covers two-thirds of these combinations and that students must also possess vocabulary knowledge to pass. The research also indicates that children could pass the test by only reading words made up of simple letter sounds. Concentrating on rarer letter combinations could hinder reading ability, whilst boosting vocabulary might be more valuable, particularly for disadvantaged children from “less language rich” homes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Adam assures her that it's worth taking a chance on love and that he's willing to face the challenges that come with it. They solidify their bond and begin a romantic relationship as well. With the real Ben in her mother's life and her own blossoming romance with Adam, Holly finally experiences a sense of stability and happiness she had been longing for. Jean and Ben's connection grows stronger with each passing day, and eventually, they fall in love. Jean decides that she wants to build a life with Ben and that their family will no longer relocate with every heartbreak. The question that arises from this movie plot is: How can the various characters in this plot—Holly, Jean, Ben, and Adam—navigate through their individual fears, insecurities, and past experiences in order to cultivate authentic and meaningful relationships with one another, and what could be the long-term impacts of the choices they make during this journey on their personal and intertwined lives?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I spent my childhood walking a fine line between being an energetic young boy and avoiding contact sports to protect my eyesight. I had lost the sight in one eye at the age of five, so instead of football, I put my energy into rowing and sailing. By the time I was 22, I was working towards rowing for my country. Then, during a training session, I noticed my vision was unclear in my remaining eye. I had an operation and spent two weeks with bandages over my eyes. Sadly, it didn't work, and the second operation two months later was also a failure. My world came crashing down. I had been flying high---- as well as my shining rowing career, I had been about to take my finals and get a job in the city. Now, as my fellow graduates celebrated their results, I lay in my childhood bedroom, angry. I would wake up in the morning and convince myself I could see a shadow, but I felt bitterly angry when I realized I couldn't. Previously, I had lots of assumptions about blind people, but now I joined their ranks. I had no choice but to change my attitude. I started to realize that my challenge was not about seeing but about creating a new life for myself. The simple pleasure of just sitting in a cafe and watching the world go by or even making eye contact with anyone is no longer possible. I had to rethink how to engage with the world. As much as I disliked the things of blindness---- white sticks, talking computers and guide dogs---- I welcomed these as the tools that would enable me to regain my independence. I moved out of my mum's house and got a job in entertainment. I also started seeking out projects that would help me get out and mix with people. A big part of my identity has always been about the thrill of competing---- success and failure. I am excited when I am giving it my all, so I started to compete again, first in rowing and then in extreme physical challenges such as completing six marathons in seven days in Gobi desert. Filling my life with experiences helped to sweep the blindness to one side. It took me... Question: We can learn from the passage that _ .

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which student learned more about mantle convection? Two friends were in college. Hank studied plate tectonics, while his buddy Alex studied Earth's atmosphere. They were both very fascinated by the subjects. Hint: The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted. Answer:","completion":"Hank learned more about mantle convection. This is because he studied plate tectonics, which is directly related to mantle convection and the movement of tectonic plates. Alex, on the other hand, studied Earth's atmosphere, which is not as directly related to mantle convection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job. He found out the job wasn't what he expected. He learned this: - 5 minutes into his job - not enough information - One week into his job - Before he started the job Answer:","completion":"It is incredibly disheartening when a job does not meet one's expectations, and realizing that it is not what was promised can lead to significant disappointment and frustration. In your case, it seems that you learned about the true nature of the job at different points in time. Here is a detailed analysis of when you discovered the reality of your employment situation: 1. Five minutes into the job: It's possible that indicators of the job not being what you expected began to show shortly after you started working. At this point, you might have noticed discrepancies between what you were told during the hiring process and what you were experiencing in the workplace. For example, the work environment, tasks, or interactions with colleagues might not have been what you were led to believe. 2. Not enough information: In some cases, lack of information during the hiring process can lead to misunderstandings about the nature of the job. If the employer did not provide a clear and comprehensive description of the role, its responsibilities, and conditions, it could have contributed to the confusion you experienced. Moreover, this lack of information is likely to have made it difficult for you to determine whether or not the job met your expectations. 3. One week into the job: Sometimes, it takes a little while to understand the true nature of a job. After working for a week, you would have had more opportunities to observe and engage with the job's responsibilities, requirements, and overall conditions. During this time, you may have become increasingly aware of the discrepancies between what you were promised and what you were experiencing, leading to the realization that the job was not what you expected. 4. Before starting the job: In some cases, individuals might discover that a job is not what they thought even before they start working. This could occur through conversations with other employees, online reviews, or further research into the company. At this point, it might have become apparent that the employer had misrepresented the role or had not provided sufficient information about it, causing you to question your decision to accept the job. To avoid the challenges you faced with this particular job, it is essential to seek accurate and detailed information about prospective roles, communicate openly with potential employers, and consider your own expectations. By doing so, you can increase the likelihood of finding a job that aligns with your values, goals, and interests, leading to a more fulfilling and positive employment experience."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Choices: (a). different meanings; (b). the same meaning;","completion":"(a). different meanings The word \\"take\\" in these two sentences has different meanings. Although \\"take\\" might appear to have a similar function within both sentences, the context of each sentence significantly alters the meaning of the word. Let's analyze each instance: 1. In the first sentence, \\"Do you take sugar in your coffee?\\" the word \\"take\\" is used to refer to the preference or habit of using sugar in one's coffee. In this case, \\"take\\" represents the act of adding or having additional ingredients (such as sugar) in the beverage. This meaning of \\"take\\" aligns more closely with the concept of personal consumption or preference. 2. In the second sentence, \\"A reading was taken of the earth's tremors.\\" the word \\"take\\" serves an entirely different purpose. Here, \\"taken\\" is the past participle of \\"take\\" and refers to the action of collecting, gathering, or measuring something, which in this case would be the earth's tremors through a reading. The focus of \\"take\\" in this sentence is on data collection, measurement, or recording, which is quite different from the meaning in the first sentence.

Movie title: The Fox and the Child Movie plot: A young girl of about 10 years lives in a farm house in the Jura mountains in eastern France. One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) leave out this scene and put the gist of its text over the scene before it. The answer is:","completion":"When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and trying to find the fox, specifically, she wants to observe the fox and its young babies from a distance without disturbing it.

Ida is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a. Misty Mundae), and is drawn to her. A mysterious package arrives for Ida one day, containing a large unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley is concerned with Ida's âpetsâ and the effect that may be laid upon her ten-year-old granddaughter Betty, who likes to disguise herself as a ladybug. Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max. Ida returns to find Misty asleep on the couch. She returns with a pillow (that has Mick inside) to give to Misty. In gratitude for Ida allowing her to stay, Misty returns the favor by seducing Ida. Unknowingly, Mickâs proboscis nips Misty's ear, which Misty dismisses. The next morning, Ida awakens to find that Misty has discovered her secret bug stash and has a great interest in bugs. They spend more time together, although Misty becomes weak and begins displaying unusual tendencies. Misty later comes across the pillow with Mick in it, and discovers that she has strange urges to lie next to it; the insect invades her much-chewed and saliva-doused ear with its proboscis.

It's not your fault, but computers naturally get slower over time as you install new software or perform your otherwise day-to-day activities. make this lower case. Firstly, let's explore why your computer could be running slow. There are various factors that contribute to this issue, such as insufficient hardware resources, too many startup programs, malware, or lack of maintenance. Now, let's discuss each aspect in detail and suggest a few methods on how you can improve your computer's performance. 1. Insufficient hardware resources: Your computer might not have enough RAM, or the CPU might not be powerful enough to handle the tasks you are performing. To solve this, you can upgrade your RAM and/or the CPU. You should also ensure there's enough free space on your hard drive as a lack of storage can lead to sluggish performance. 2. Too many startup programs: If you have too many programs that start up automatically when your computer boots up, this can significantly slow down its boot time. You can manage these startup programs by using Windows Task Manager (just press Ctrl-Shift-Esc). Once it is open, click on the Startup tab, where you can disable unnecessary programs from starting automatically when your computer starts up. 3. Malware: Malware, adware, or viruses can bog down your computer's performance. To prevent this, be cautious of any suspicious emails or websites, and always have a reliable antivirus software installed. Regularly run scans and update your antivirus software to keep your computer protected. 4. Lack of maintenance: Regular maintenance is important to keep your computer running smoothly. Here are a few tips for maintaining your computer: a. Remove unused programs: Uninstalling programs that you no longer need can free up valuable disk space and improve system performance. b. Clean up temporary files: Deleting temporary files from your computer can also free up disk space and improve system speed. You can use Windows' built-in Disk Cleanup tool or a third-party application to remove these files. c. Defragment your hard drive: Over time, files on your hard drive can become fragmented, making it slower for your computer to access them. Defragmenting your hard drive can help improve its read/write performance. If you have an SSD, don't defrag it, as they do not benefit from this process in the way that traditional hard drives do. d. Update your software: Keep your operating system, drivers, and software applications up to date to ensure they perform efficiently and securely. e. Optimize your computer's power settings: Improper power settings can slow down your computer. Ensure that your power settings are optimized for performance in your computer's control panel or settings app. By addressing each of these issues, you can potentially improve your computer's performance and speed, making your day-to-day activities more efficient and enjoyable.

Given the question: Q: Carboxylic acids are weak acids, meaning they are not 100% ionized in what? Choices: - air - ethanol - liquid - water A: The answer is:","completion":"Carboxylic acids are weak acids, meaning they are not 100% ionized in water. Carboxylic acids, which have the general formula R-COOH, are organic compounds that contain a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to an alkyl or aryl group (R). Examples of carboxylic acids include acetic acid (found in vinegar), citric acid (found in citrus fruits), and lactic acid (found in yogurt and sour milk products). In aqueous solutions, carboxylic acids can undergo ionization, or more specifically, partial ionization, which means that only a small percentage of the acid molecules will lose a proton (H+) and become ionized. This is because the carboxyl group is hydrophilic, which means it attracts water, and the R group is hydrophobic, which means it repels water. The hydrophilic nature of the carboxyl group facilitates the ionization process, while the hydrophobic nature of the R group hinders it. The ionization of carboxylic acids in water can be represented by the following equilibrium reaction: R-COOH (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ R-COO⁻ (aq) + H3O⁺ (aq) In this reaction, the carboxylic acid (R-COOH) donates a proton (H+) to a water molecule (H2O) to form a negatively charged carboxylate ion (R-COO⁻) and a positively charged hydronium ion (H3O⁺). Since the reaction is in equilibrium, only a small percentage of the carboxylic acid molecules will be ionized at any given time, and the majority of the acid will remain in its un-ionized form. This means that the concentration of H3O⁺ ions in the solution will be relatively low, resulting in a correspondingly low acidity or pH value. Weak acids, like carboxylic acids, are more likely to be 100% ionized in more polar solvents. Water is a highly polar solvent, which allows it to strongly interact with the hydrophilic carboxyl group and facilitate ionization. However, because carboxylic acids are only partially ionized in water, they are considered weak acids. Other solvents, like air, ethanol, and various liquids, may produce different ionization behavior depending on their polarity and other properties. For example, carboxylic acids are even weaker acids in a less polar solvent like ethanol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Next question: who sings i'm in love with my car?","completion":"\\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is a song by the famous British rock band Queen. It was written and sung by Queen's drummer, Roger Taylor. The song is featured on the band's 1975 album, \\"A Night at the Opera.\\" As one of Queen's lesser-known tracks, \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" has developed a cult following among fans. The idea for the song reportedly came to Roger Taylor after one of their roadies, Johnathan Harris, had a deep affection for his car. It serves as an ode to car enthusiasts and is often considered an anthem for them. Its lyrics illustrate a person's anthropomorphic attachment to their car and their preference for the automobile over their romantic partner. The song is characterized by its heavy and driving rhythm, which accentuates the theme of automobile obsession. \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" was released as the B-side to one of Queen's most iconic singles, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Due to its placement on the single, the song received some attention and even charted in certain regions. Although it overshadowed by \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" remains an essential part of Queen's extensive catalog. The song showcases Roger Taylor's powerful and distinctive voice as the lead singer, which varies from the more familiar vocals of Freddie Mercury, the band's primary vocalist.

I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife? Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

As a comedian who's been to dozens of comedy clubs, I was extremely disappointed with the disorganization of StandUp Live. I live in CenPho. CityScape is something I'd been anticipating and happy to have Downtown. It's about time we get a real comedy club here! I'd rather spend my money locally than drive to Tempe. (I WON tickets to see Chris Titus, but they were 25 each which is more than fair to pay for this kind of talent. Review is based on the rest of the experience.) My email notified me to be at the venue for the show, which was supposed to start at 9:45. We got there at 9:30. And stood in line at will-call for 10 minutes. (She asked for our parking stub to validate. Thanks!) There was a big group in front of us, a few behind us and ONE girl working the ticket booth. One. On a Friday night. For Chris Titus. Fail #1. As we walked upstairs, there were people lined up, waiting to get in. They gave out a buzzer to let you know when it was your turn to be seated. What??? Why not seat people as they showed up? Don't you want people to start ordering drinks & food BEFORE a show starts? I've gone to clubs early to have a bite to eat and get settled before the show starts. Besides, like comics like to say \\"The more you drink, the funnier I am.\\" Fail #2 So, we wait. We were told to go into the lobby, with our buzzer, to wait to be seated. Servers were lined up to take each party to their tables. That's the only nice touch of the evening, but even they were backed-up. (It was nice, though, to be out of the monsoon heat!) My buzzer started to blink, so I went to the podium to let the girl working there know. I was informed that it also had to vibrate to get seated. WHY DID IT START BLINKING, THEN??? Fail #3 So, we waiting another half hour. By then, it was after 10:30. The show was supposed to start at 9:45. (So I was told) I am ok waiting a little while. It was the second show of the night, tables have to be cleaned, etc. But it was now almost an hour past the time I was told it would start. Fail #4 Two people in my party went into the bar next door to get drinks, which didn't count towards the 2-drink minimum. Wait, what? Patrons are spending money within the same company, yet those drinks don't count? Fail #5 Finally, we were seated. Our server happened to be a fellow comedian, and he did a great job. He was the only saving grace of the evening (besides the entertainment itself.) Chris Titus wore a wireless mic, which is great for his act, but the volume? Fail #6 I wish I had checked our tab (and other reviews before going) at the end of the night. Based on the other reviews, we may have been charged the gratuity, but we still left a tip. Prices were CRAZY and NOT on the menu. My friend's martini was 11. And it was TINY. She never would have ordered it if she had known how much it was. I got a non-alcoholic pina colada, which was 6. That's a fair price, but still not on the menu. Fail #7 Our server let us know when last call was & we got our bill in a timely manner. We all paid cash (which, based on other reviews, I am thankful for!) and got our change promptly. The show finally ended just before 12:30. Again, Titus was awesome and did a 90-minute set. But for the long wait to get our tickets, get in line, get in another line and get seated made the evening not as enjoyable as I had anticipated. I really hope StandUp Live gets their seating & serving system more organized. Apparently, they were \\"trying something new\\" last night. That's something that should be worked out on a slower night, NOT when you've got a few hundred people waiting to see a national headliner who's also had TV shows & is incredibly popular.

I would hate to see this club not do well because of some little adjustments that could be made NOW, rather than when it's too late. We NEED to keep a comedy club Downtown.

Turkey's lawmakers voted Thursday to authorize military force against the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq, opening the door to cooperation with a U.S.-led coalition going after ISIS as its fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border. The Turkish Parliament voted 298-98 to not only to let the country's military leave its borders to go after ISIS and other terror groups, but also allow foreign troops to launch operations from Turkey. The authorization takes effect Saturday. It is a big shift for Turkey, a NATO member, which until now offered only tacit support to a U.S.-led coalition of about 40 nations going after ISIS in Iraq and Syria in various capacities. Many have taken to social media to ask why there has been seemingly little attention by the United States and its coalition partners paid to helping the Kurdish fighters in","completion":"Kobani, a strategic border town in Syria that has been under siege by ISIS for nearly a month. The fierce battle has seen thousands of Kurdish civilians flee into Turkey for safety, exacerbating an already severe refugee crisis in the region. The Turkish government's decision to authorize military force and allow foreign troops to use its soil for launching operations is expected to significantly bolster the international coalition's efforts against ISIS in the region. This development is particularly crucial, given that Turkey shares a lengthy border with both Syria and Iraq, countries where ISIS has established de facto control over large territories. Now, with Turkey's full commitment to the fight against ISIS, the United States and its coalition partners are likely to turn their attention to assisting Kurdish fighters in Kobani and other embattled areas. The Kurdish forces have been one of the most effective groups combating ISIS on the ground, as they have successfully defended their territories in both Iraq and Syria. Their assistance, along with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has proven to be an essential element in combating the terrorist group. As the Turkish military begins to plan and coordinate its operations against ISIS, it's likely that its first priority will be to secure the safety of the Turkish border and prevent the further expansion of ISIS forces from Syria into Turkish territory. This will likely involve close cooperation with Kurdish forces operating in the area. In response to the question of why there has been apparently little assistance provided to Kurdish fighters in Northern Syria, some speculate that Western powers, including the United States, have been reluctant to directly support Kurdish forces due to domestic political considerations in Turkey and ongoing concerns about the aspirations of Kurdish nationalist movements in the region. Turkey, which has a substantial Kurdish minority, has long been wary of any move that could potentially empower Kurdish separatists and further complicate relations in the region. However, now that Turkey has officially joined the fight against ISIS, it is likely that the United States and its allies will step up efforts to provide greater support to Kurdish forces. This may come in the form of increased air support, intelligence sharing, and potentially the delivery of much-needed weapons and ammunition to the Kurdish fighters on the ground. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story is that the authorization of military force by Turkey's lawmakers will lead to a more concerted effort by the international coalition to support Kurdish fighters in their struggle against ISIS. With Turkey's participation, the United States and its partners will be better positioned to more effectively target ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, protect vulnerable populations, and ultimately degrade and defeat the terrorist group. Furthermore, the international community must continue to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis, offering assistance to the thousands of refugees fleeing violence and devastation in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Box Office: Angelina Jolie's 'Maleficent' Scores Magnificent 170M Weekend, 'X-Men' Crosses 500M Angelina Jolie’s returned to the silver screen after a near-four year absence and hit the ground running. Walt Disney’s Maleficent, a darker re-imagining of the Sleeping Beauty story with the emphasis on its conflicted villain, debuted over the weekend with a terrific 69.4 million frame, including 6.7m in IMAX alone. That sum included 4.2m in Thursday showings. This is a bit below the 79m debut weekend for Sam Raimi’s Oz: The Great and Powerful. It’s obviously smaller than the 116m weekend debut for Tim Burton’s Alice In Wonderland back in March 2010, which was a record for a non-sequel at the time, but absolutely no one was expecting similar numbers for the Jolie vehicle. In terms of weekend multipliers, it scored a 24.2m opening day, which means the Jolie vehicle had a 2.89x, almost identical to the Mia Wasikowska/Johnny Depp fantasy over its Fri-Sun debut. This is easily Angelina Jolie’s biggest opening weekend ever, ahead of the respective 50 million debuts for Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Wanted and another example of why movie stars still matter. This is as perfect a “star+concept” package as you could imagine, with cinema’s most larger-than-life female movie star playing one of Disney’s most iconic villains. Angelina Jolie in The Tourist only gets you an 18m weekend. Maleficent starring pretty much any one else gets you 50m at best. But putting Jolie in the role gets this you this terrific debut. The 180m fairy tale revamp has also earned 100.6m overseas, including 2.3m in IMAX alone, since opening on Wednesday in 35 territories including Russia, Germany, Australia, the U.K., Korea and Brazil. That gives the film a 170m global debut. How high it flies is a question of how well it plays with the kids. The film is less violent and scary that the trailers might make you believe, but it’s a far grimmer and darker picture than the marketing indicates. I’m perhaps a little “biased” as my daughter didn’t like the film after months of looking forward to it, but I can’t presume that my kid speaks for everyone else. Let’s presume that the film’s tone and somewhat scotch tape-like construction doesn’t really affect word of mouth either way. For the record, Snow White and the Huntsman had a 2.76x weekend-to-domestic final multiplier (155/55m), Alice in Wonderland had a 2.87x multiplier (334m/116m), while Oz: The Great and Powerful had a 2.96x (235m/79m). So going off those relative comparisons, Maleficent is looking at a domestic total of between 193m and 207m. I’m inclined to presume it will act closer to Snow White and the Huntsman considering the similar release date and darker content, but I also imagine that if it gets anywhere near 200 million domestic that it will be dragged over the finish line one way or another, arguably joining the other so close-yet so far blockbusters (Amazing Spider-Man 2, Godzilla, X-Men: Days of Future Past). Nonetheless, the debut shows the sheer power of the Walt Disney brand, as well as the value of old-school star power. And yes, because this can’t be said enough, it indeed matters when an explicitly female-centric picture opens on the same relative scale as conventional male-centric blockbusters. The film played 60% female, 51% over-25, and 35% 3D. The other major opener was frankly a disappointment. Seth MacFarlane’s A Million Ways to Die in the West debuted with 16.7 million over its debut weekend. I honestly thought a few months ago that this star-studded (Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris) would be a solid moneymaker for Universal (a division of Comcast Corporation). It won’t lose money, since it only cost 40m, but it won’t be a massive win either. Now absolutely no one in their right mind was expecting an opening on par with Ted (54m) or Neighbors (49m), but this is just ever-so-slightly underwhelming considering the combined drawing power of its cast. The film played 55% male and 72% over-25. The picture also earned 10.3 million in 21 overseas markets. While I don’t think the film quite works, it’s important that MacFarlane be praised rather than condemned for stepping outside of his safe zone, especially as the concessions to his stereotypical fan base (the vulgar potty humor) is a big part of why the film doesn’t work. Once again, I would argue this proves the value of movie stars, as a big part of Ted‘s success was Mark Wahlberg’s drawing power, along with obviously the more easily marketable concept two years ago. “A man’s childhood teddy bear came alive and now lives with him and spouts vulgarities” is an easier sell than “a western comedy.” Charlize Theron is an added value element while Liam Neeson is gold as an action lead, but really no one else in the cast can be considered box office. MacFarlane is a draw, but casting a live-action movie star would have helped the film, both artistically and commercially. Westerns aren’t traditionally big box office and western comedies are all-too-rare. Offhand, the last successful live-action western comedy that comes to mind is the Mel Gibson/Jodie Foster vehicle Maverick from literally twenty years ago (you might count Shanghai Noon in 2000 and Shanghai Knights in 2003, but that terrific Jackie Chan/Owen Wilson series is as much about action as comedy). So it’s disappointing, but not that shocking, that this one didn’t break out. Still, once again, Universal (which distributed the Media Rights Capital, Fuzzy Door Productions, and Bluegrass Films-produced picture) isn’t risking too much because there isn’t much money on the line. MacFarlane has Ted 2 on tap for next summer, which is arguably a surefire hit. I wish it were a better movie, but I think its worthwhile that MacFarlane has started using his capital for more personal choices like this and Fox’s successful Cosmos revamp. In holdover news, X-Men: Days of Future Past earned 32.5 million on its second weekend, down 64% from last weekend’s 90m Fri-Sun debut. That’s right in line with the franchise overall, compared to the 66% Friday-to-Friday drop for X-Men: The Last Stand (102m/35m), 69% drop X-Men Origins: Wolverine (85m/26m), the 68% drop for The Wolverine (53m/21m), the 65% drop for X-Men (54m/23m), the 64% drop for X-Men: First Class (55m/24m), and the 60% drop for X2 (85m/40m). The 20th Century Fox franchise installment now has 162m domestic. The seventh X-Men film is currently running around 8% behind X-Men: The Last Stand, which means if said pattern continues it will end up at 218 million. It will be the second-biggest in the series but pretty much in the middle when adjusted for inflation and the 3D bump. The bad news is that this X-Men installment is just as front-loaded as the other installments in America. The good news is that with an estimated global cume of 500m worldwide as of today, its somewhat disappointing domestic numbers may be almost irrelevant. The film has already surpassed the worldwide totals of X-Men (296m), X-Men: First Class (353m) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine (373m), X2: X-Men United (407m), The Wolverine (412m), and X-Men: The Last Stand (459m) not far behind. This one cost Fox (a division of 21st Century Fox, Inc.) quite a bit of money, well over 20o million and with the hopes of putting the X-Men series on the same level as the Marvel Studios films. In terms of worldwide totals (and money is money no matter where it comes from), it would seem that they have succeeded. I will officially stop being picky about the film’s domestic number for at least the next week or so. Also not exactly holding all that well is Godzilla, which earned 12.25 million on its third weekend, a drop of 60% from last weekend. Warner Bros.’ 165m monster mash has earned 174m domestic. This one will get to 200m domestic but not too much more than that. Gareth Edwards’s franchise revival has earned 374m worldwide, so it will surely end up at least breaking even before its post-theatrical life. The good news is that the film doesn’t open in China and Japan until the middle of next month, so this picture’s worldwide box office story isn’t closed to being written yet. The question is that if the film ends up basically peaking on opening weekend, to what extent should we give credit to director Gareth Edwards (who got a Star Wars spin-off gig off of the film’s debut) as opposed to Warner Bros. marketing? That’s for another day… Blended dropped an okay 41% from last Friday, as the Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore romantic comedy earned just 8.4 million last night for a 29.6m cume. This Warner Bros. (a division of Time Warner, Inc.) release only cost 45m to produce, but it may not even make that much in the states. Now Adam Sandler movies often take hard second weekend drops before leveling off for the next month as the “consensus choice”, but when you started with just 14.2m for the opening weekend, that’s little consolation. In better comedy news, Neighbors earned another 7.7m over its fourth weekend, giving the Seth Rogen/Rose Byrne/Zac Efron comedy a robust 128.6m domestic cume. The 18m comedy crossed 200m worldwide this weekend and has now earned 207m globally. Million Dollar Arm officially passed its 25m budget in America and now sits with 28m, while The Other Woman should crossed 80m domestic. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 earned another 3.775m over its sixth weekend(-52%) for a 192.73m domestic cume. The film also crossed 690m worldwide this weekend, which means it should cross 700m within the next week or two. Of note, the sequel has now earned 497m overseas, surpassing the 495m foreign total of The Amazing Spider-Man. It’s also the top-grossing film of 2014 in terms of overseas receipts. Heaven is For Real earned another 775k for the weekend (-62%) and brought its cume up to 87.98m while Mom’s Night Out earned 300k (-61%) and has now grossed 9.6m. Jon Favreau’s Chef is now playing on 674 screens and earned 2m (-11%) for a 7m cume. It’s not terrible, but it’s also about half what a film like this could have managed on opening weekend with a conventional wide release less than a decade ago. That’s it for this weekend. Join us next time for when Warner Bros. debuts the terrific Tom Cruise/Emily Blunt sci-fi actioner Edge of Tomorrow (I don’t know that one’s overseas debut numbers yet, save that it did 1.6m on 79 IMAX screens) while 20th Century Fox drops the much-buzzed about (seeing it tomorrow) Shaleine Woodley cancer-stricken romantic drama The Fault in Our Stars.

It is was produced by Roger Corman, who at this point had already produced a few WIPs. It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. The movie takes place in an USA prison, not in a \\"banana republic\\" like most WIP films. I'm not sure if that was a wise move, but it is an acceptable change of pace. Writer-director Demme really gets into his job, always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario. In fact, he is a little too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick. But do not worry, Demme still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre. There is plenty of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. The film is a little slow, but it is very entertaining. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so she does not need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden. Pam Grier is sorely missed, though. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review appears to be mixed. While the reviewer acknowledges and appreciates the efforts made by writer-director Demme to present a fresh take on the familiar WIP sub-genre and commends the performances of some cast members, there is also criticism regarding the movie's pace, some creative choices, and the absence of a popular actress (Pam Grier) in the film. The reviewer notes that the film is entertaining and delivers on aspects like nudity and violence, which are expected in WIP movies, but they also discuss certain weaknesses and shortcomings in the production. Overall, the sentiment suggests that the movie falls somewhere in the middle – it has its strengths and weaknesses, making it neither a completely positive nor negative review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \\"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \\"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\\" \\"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue in the eating experience.\\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \\"food sound salience\\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises. The ones loud enough to mask the sound of chewing made subjects eat more -- 4 pretzels compared to 2.75 pretzels for the \\"quiet\\" group. In another of their experiments they found that just having people hear chewing sounds through an advertisement can decrease the amount they eat. Elder and Morh call this the \\"Crunch Effect.\\" The main takeaway of their work should be the idea of mindfulness, they said. Being more mindful of not just the taste and physical appearance of food, but also of the sound it makes can help consumers to eat less. \\"When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,\\" Elder said. \\"The effects may not...

Question: Organic food, once considered something that only health fanatics desired, is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Conventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Whose decision to leave causes Alise to be left in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers and animal friends? from the following article ? Inhabited on a mysterious island are strange creatures called Boggs who love meat. Unbeknownst to them, it is also inhabited by a shipwrecked boy. He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun. On the first night they see the Polar Star and Lord Rogers says that sailors always used this star to guide the way back home. A:","completion":"The decision to leave that causes Alise to be left in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animal friends is made by Odette and Derek. They decide to leave in order to help the people by building a bridge. While Odette and Derek are away, it falls upon Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animal friends - Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin, and the Scullions - to take care of Alise and try to teach her how to be a proper princess. However, Alise desires to be a modern princess and wants to go on adventures rather than follow the strict rules imposed by Queen Uberta.

Veolia Transport says the closures at Penclawdd near Swansea and Treforest followed a business review. But it said other companies will be taking over their routes from June. Passengers' group Bus Users UK Cymru said it was disappointed and the focus was on whether councils could re-tender the services. The French-owned firm's chief executive John O'Brien said in March the firm was looking at \\"restructuring\\" in Wales. \\"Following the recent business review we confirm that our Penclawdd depot on the Gower and our Treforest depot outside Cardiff will both be closing over the next few weeks,\\" a statement on Friday read. \\"The schools and local bus services provided from these sites are being taken over by other bus companies.\\" It said many staff would transfer to the new operators and it was in discussions with workers and the Unite union. \\"Our other operating sites at Newport, Abercrave in the Swansea Valley and Crossgates in Powys are unaffected and operations from these sites are continuing as normal,\\" said the statement. Veolia have not confirmed how many services it is withdrawing, but reports suggest the figure stands at 78. Rhondda Cynon Taf is understood to be worst affected by the closures as Veolia provides 28 services in the borough. Services that are partially or wholly subsidised by RCT council will stop at the end of June with commercially-run services stopping on 14 June. \\"Discussions with other commercial operators in the county borough continue with existing providers assessing the need to extend existing routes or introduce new ones,\\" said a council spokesman. \\"A tender process has also begun to secure replacement operators for the services that are wholly or partly subsidised by the Council and were previously operated by Veolia.\\" Cynon Valley AM Christine Chapman added: \\"We need to ensure the stability and certainty of services.\\" Veolia, which employs 450 people in Wales, will also withdraw from routes in Cardiff, Swansea, Bridgend, Vale of Glamorgan, and Merthyr Tydfil. All councils have already made moves to find replacements. Veolia became one of the main operators in Wales in 2006 when it bought Shamrock Travel which saw it take over operating centres in Abercynon, Swansea, Barry and Newport along with 229 vehicles. The firm had previously bought south Wales-based firms Bebb Travel and Pullman Coaches. Many of its services were contracts for local authorities who are having to re-tender their contracts. In November 2010, Veolia was fined £32,900 and banned from starting any new routes for three months, as punishment for poor bus punctuality in the Cardiff area. It was also ordered to cut its active fleet from 396 to 277 vehicles. \\"People have been concerned for a while,\\" said Margaret Everson from Bus Users UK Cymru. \\"We've heard various statements culminating in this one. \\"We are disappointed because Veolia bought up several small companies and moulded it into one operation which we thought was a good move at the time. \\"The focus now will be whether the local authorities will be able to re-tender the services.\\" In a separate blow to customers in the Pontypridd and Cardiff areas, St David's Travel could be forced to withdraw bus services soon.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Elmer Kenneth Strong (April 21, 1906 - October 5, 1979) was an American football halfback and fullback who also played minor league baseball. Considered one of the greatest all-around players in the early decades of the game, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1957 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and was named to the NFL 1930s All-Decade Team. A native of West Haven, Connecticut, Strong played college baseball and football for the NYU Violets. In football, he led the country in scoring with 162 points in 1928, gained over 3,000 yards from scrimmage, and was a consensus first-team selection on the 1928 College Football All-America Team. Unable to reach terms with the New York Giants, Strong signed instead with the Staten Island Stapletons. He played for the Stapletons for four years from 1929 to 1932. While statistics are not available for the 1929 NFL season, Strong was regarded as one of the best backs in the NFL. He started all 10 games at halfback for the 1929 Stapletons. In his first NFL game, he threw a long forward pass to set up the Stapleton's first touchdown and scored all of the team's 12 points on two short touchdown runs. He also had a 70-yard run in a scoreless tie with the Orange Tornadoes on November 3, 1929. Two days later, Strong had a 50-yard touchdown run against the Providence Steam Roller. At the end of the 1929 season, Strong was selected by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette as a second-team All-Pro. In 1930, Strong appeared in all 12 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on two rushing touchdowns, five receiving touchdowns, one field goal, and eight extra points. His point total ranked third in the NFL in 1930, trailing only Jack McBride (56 points) and Verne Lewellen (54 points). On September 28, 1930, he caught two touchdown passes, threw a 40-yard pass that set up a third touchdown, and kicked three extra points in a 21-0 victory over the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In December 1930, he led the Stapletons to a 16-7 victory over the New York Giants for the pro football championship of New York City; Strong accounted for all 16 Stapleton points, running 98 yards for a touchdown, passing for a second touchdown, and kicking a field goal and an extra point. He was selected as a first-team player on the 1930 All-Pro Team by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette. In 1931, Strong appeared in all 11 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on six rushing touchdowns, one punt return for a touchdown, two field goals, and five extra points. His 53 points ranked fourth in the NFL, trailing only Johnny Blood (84 points), Ernie Nevers (66 points), and Dutch Clark (60 points). On November 22, 1931, Strong scored all 16 points in a 16-7 victory over Cleveland; he had two rushing touchdowns, including a 50-yard run and kicked a field goal and an extra point. At the end of the 1931 season, Strong was selected as an All-Pro for the second year in a row, receiving first-team honors from the United Press (UP) and Collyer's Eye. Strong's output dropped off in 1932 as he moved to the fullback position. He appeared in 11 games and ranked sixth in the NFL with 375 rushing yards, but scored only 15 points on two touchdowns and three extra points. At the end of the 1932 season, the Stapletons team folded.

Answer the above question based on the context below: India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.

Plot title: Hart's War Movie plot: During World War II, U.S. Army intelligence officer First Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) is captured by German forces. While interrogating Hart, the Germans coerce him to divulge intelligence by taking away his boots, causing his feet to become frostbitten and badly injured, and leaving him, naked, in a very cold cell. He is then transferred by train to Stalag VI-A prisoner of war camp at Hemer, Germany. While en route, a P-51 Mustang attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing. After arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie when Hart says he only endured three days of interrogation. McNamara does not reveal this to Hart, but sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers. Two black pilots are brought to the camp and assigned to Hart's barracks. They are the only blacks in the camp, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sgt. Vic W. Bedford (Hauser), a racist, is their primary antagonist. One of the pilots, Lt. Lamar Archer, is executed when accused of keeping a weapon that Bedford had planted in his bunk. When Bedford himself subsequently turns up dead, the surviving pilot, Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) is accused of killing Bedford in retaliation. A law student before the war, Hart is appointed by McNamara to defend the accused pilot at his court-martial, a trial to which the camp commandant, Oberst Werner Visser (IureÅ) agrees. Much later, McNamara reveals to Hart that the \\"defense,\\" like the trial itself, is a sham, an elaborate distraction to hide a planned attack on a nearby ammunition plant (the U.S. Army mistakenly believes it to be a shoe factory) by...

Article: In central and northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean.[V] Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money. Question: What accounting method was utilized in this period?","completion":"During this period, the accounting method that was used is called double-entry bookkeeping. This method helps keep track of money coming in and going out by recording both sides of each transaction - like money coming in as a \\"credit\\" and money going out as a \\"debit.\\" This way, people can easily understand how much money they have and what they are spending it on."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.

Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira. Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydiceâs veil.

We will leave only when you pull closer to the European Union, when you change the constitution, when you alter the government's power structure, they have loudly insisted. But why? Why have thousands of protesters staked their lives, seemingly, on their desire for political change? And why has the government resisted their calls so vehemently? Let's take a look: 1. What prompted the protests? At the heart of the protests is a trade pact. For a year, President Viktor Yanukovych insisted he was intent on signing a historical political and trade agreement with the European Union. But on November 21, he decided to suspend talks with the EU. They took to the streets, demanding that OPTIONS: - EU sign the EU deal. - European Union sign the EU deal. - Independence Square sign the EU deal. - Kiev sign the EU deal. - Maidan sign the EU deal. - Russia sign the EU deal. - Ukraine sign the EU deal. - Viktor Yanukovych sign the EU deal. - West sign the EU deal.","completion":"Correct Answer(s): - Ukraine sign the EU deal. - Viktor Yanukovych sign the EU deal.

Now, let's consider why the other options are incorrect: - The European Union (EU), in this context, is the body Ukraine would be signing an agreement with, not the one expected to sign the EU deal. - Independence Square, Kiev, and Maidan are geographic locations and cannot sign a deal. - Russia is not directly involved in the situation described - the issue was between Ukraine and the EU. - The 'West' is too broad and ambiguous in this context. In international relations, the 'West' often refers to countries with shared democratic values, but it's not accurate or specific in this context. - Protester's demands were directed towards their own country's government (represented by Viktor Yanukovych), not the EU or other entities.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

The soldiers were proper and kept the vests but not the boots because the Possible answers: I. vests were wrong. II. boots were wrong.","completion":"The soldiers were proper and kept the vests but not the boots because of multiple factors that contributed to the decision-making process during their meticulous planning and execution. The reasons for choosing the vests over the boots can be classified under two primary headings: 1. Functional Utility: The soldiers, who were clad in their battle-hardened gear, found the vests to be more advantageous when it came to fulfilling their tactical objectives. The vests provided them with ample protection, enhanced mobility, and the flexibility required to adapt to rapidly evolving scenarios on the battlefield. With the integration of advanced materials and designs, the vests effectively shielded the soldiers from enemy fire and minimized injuries. Additionally, these vests facilitated the ideal weight distribution for carrying an extensive range of equipment and ammunition, thereby enabling the soldiers to partake in intensive combat operations while reducing fatigue. On the other hand, the boots failed to cater to the specific requirements and expectations of the soldiers. With prolonged use and exposure to harsh environmental conditions, the boots demonstrated shortcomings in terms of durability and resilience. Moreover, the subpar quality construction and absence of a suitable support system rendered the boots uncomfortable and incompatible with the intense physical demands of combat. This resulted in the soldiers opting against using the boots, as they were unsuitable for facilitating optimal performance. 2. Adaptation to Terrain: Varying geographical terrains played a pivotal role in influencing the soldiers' decision to keep the vests and discard the boots. The vests, being fundamental to their standard operational gear, facilitated seamless maneuverability and adaptability for diverse terrains and topographies. The adjustable and modular design of these vests further enabled the soldiers to modify their gear as per the unpredictability of the battlefield. In contrast, the boots were unable to cater to the adaptive nature required for traversing through different terrains. The suboptimal design, coupled with the lack of waterproofing, breathability, and insulation features, rendered the boots inefficient for withstanding diverse and extreme climatic conditions. Additionally, the undersized and rigid structure of the boots hampered the soldiers' ability to negotiate challenging obstacles and negotiate difficult terrains, thereby significantly diminishing their capability to adopt tailored combat strategies effectively. In conclusion, the soldiers made a calculated decision to retain the vests and abandon the boots based on the two essential factors mentioned above. The vests proved to be superior in terms of functional utility, securely protecting the soldiers while allowing them to carry vital equipment with ease. Moreover, the vests aided the soldiers in adapting effortlessly to the dynamic battle terrains, thus ensuring the flawless execution of their operations. Conversely, the boots were deemed ineffective both in design and utility, affecting the soldiers' comfort and adaptability in challenging combat conditions, which ultimately led to their unanimous rejection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this. Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, Messiah of Evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off. The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. It doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror. The surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon', a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirrel-eating albino. Part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the 'intentional', the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - WRAP SCENE' blur hopelessly. Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary. While we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture, Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'Dark Stranger' who came from the woods one day. In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years (you can hear the MST3K line already: 'man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain') and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater. I generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. The general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. Add to that the choppy editing, average acting and Hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and I'd file Messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.

Despite her immense talent, Yan'er constantly faces rejection and is unable to land any significant roles. Disheartened by her lack of success, Yan'er decides to take matters into her own hands and create her own indie film project, enlisting the help of her best friend, an ambitious screenwriter, and a down-on-his-luck film director who once had a promising career. With their combined talents, the team sets out to create a heartwarming, slice-of-life film about the trials and tribulations of young adulthood, exploring themes of love, friendship, and personal growth. Throughout the production, Yan'er discovers her strengths and boundaries, realizing the importance of staying true to her artistic vision and not compromising for fame or quick success. However, as the project gains attention from local media, they also encounter setbacks and struggles in financing the film, facing repeated interference from an arrogant film producer who wants to steal their idea and transform it into a shallow, commercialized film. Determined to preserve their artistic vision, Yan'er and her friends persevere through the numerous setbacks and eventually secure funding for their film from a kind-hearted philanthropist who believes in the project's potential. As the film's production reaches its climax, Yan'er delivers a moving performance that touches the hearts of all who witness it – including the initially skeptical film director who begins to rediscover his passion for filmmaking.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation? In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...

Can you tell me the answer to who is the prophet who was thrown into the sea and swallowed by the whale??","completion":"The prophet who was thrown into the sea and subsequently swallowed by a whale (or a big fish) is Jonah. His story is narrated in the religious texts of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In the Hebrew Bible, his story is found in the Book of Jonah, while in the Christian New Testament it is referred to in the Gospel of Matthew. In Islam, his tale is detailed in the Quran, where he is known as Yunus or Dhul-Nun. Jonah was a prophet of God who was commanded to convey a message to the people of Nineveh, an ancient city located in present-day Iraq. The people of Nineveh were known for their wickedness and idolatry, and God wanted Jonah to warn them to repent and follow the righteous path, or else they would face divine destruction. However, Jonah was reluctant to follow God's command because he doubted that the people of Nineveh would heed his warnings and amend their ways. Fearing their hostility, he attempted to escape his mission by boarding a ship bound for Tarshish, a city far in the opposite direction. As the ship sailed, a severe storm arose at sea, and the panicked sailors began praying to their gods for mercy. Believing that the storm was the result of divine anger against someone on board, they cast lots to identify the guilty party. The lot fell upon Jonah, and the sailors realized it was because of him the storm had been unleashed. Jonah admitted that he was fleeing from God's command and suggested that the sailors throw him into the sea to calm the storm. Reluctantly, the sailors complied and cast him overboard. Miraculously, the sea immediately grew calm. Meanwhile, Jonah was swallowed by a whale (or a big fish) sent by God to protect him from drowning. It is worth noting that in Islamic tradition, the swallowing of Jonah is seen as a divine punishment rather than a rescue. Jonah remained in the belly of the whale for three days and nights (some interpretations vary on the duration). While in the whale, Jonah prayed to God for forgiveness and acknowledged his wrongdoing. He realized the gravity of avoiding his responsibilities as a prophet and pledged to correct his actions. God heard Jonah's supplications and commanded the whale to release him onto the shore. Jonah was then given a second chance to carry out his mission. He went to Nineveh and warned the people of their impending doom if they did not repent. To his surprise, they heeded his message and turned to God for forgiveness, showing genuine remorse for their past actions. Upon witnessing this unexpected change of heart, God chose to spare Nineveh from destruction. This merciful act served as a lesson for Jonah as well, illustrating the depth of God's compassion and forgiveness. The story of Jonah ultimately emphasizes the importance of obedience to divine command, repentance, and God's boundless mercy for both the prophet and the people he was sent to save."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nelson was on a mission to ruin Michael 's career because","completion":"Nelson was on a mission to ruin Michael's career because, over the years, a deep-seated grudge had developed between them, stemming from a series of professional and personal disputes that had turned the once-amiable colleagues into bitter rivals. During their early professional years, Michael and Nelson started as ambitious, energetic, and talented young employees at an up-and-coming marketing firm. Michael, a gifted public speaker with a knack for persuading people, excelled in developing relationships with clients, quickly solidifying the company's reputation as a reliable partner for fostering brand growth. Nelson, on the other hand, was a creative genius who was responsible for most of the firm's innovative and avant-garde marketing campaigns that propelled the company to new heights. As both men continued to excel in their respective roles, they developed a sense of rivalry and began to harbor a fierce competitive streak. However, it remained largely unspoken and nothing more than friendly banter, as the pair recognized their mutual talent. For years, the healthy competition between Michael and Nelson helped bring about greater success for the company and individual recognition for both of them. Unfortunately, the tipping point of their rivalry occurred at the company's annual conference when Michael was awarded the title of 'Employee of the Year'. Nelson, despite his many extraordinary accomplishments, was overlooked for the accolade. This enraged Nelson, who felt that his contributions had not only been underappreciated but also deliberately ignored. Feeling slighted, Nelson began to harbor resentment towards Michael, which led him to undermine his success at every turn. From spreading gossip among their colleagues to belittling Michael's achievements, Nelson used any opportunity to tarnish Michael's reputation. However, this covert rivalry remained unknown to Michael, enabling Nelson to continue his acts of sabotage surreptitiously. One day, Nelson came across an opportunity to make a significant impact. He learned of a lucrative client that Michael was tasked to impress and sign with the firm. Realizing the gravity of this responsibility for Michael's career, Nelson devised a plan to not only ruin the project but also to target Michael's credibility as a valued employee at the company. Nelson began his ploy by constructing a fake email correspondence between Michael and a competing client designed to look like Michael was giving away sensitive marketing strategies. Then, he managed to acquire a copy of the presentation Michael had prepared, where Nelson made subtle changes that appeared unprofessional and even offensive. Nelson also circulated a rumor that Michael was planning to leave the firm, casting doubts on Michael's loyalty and intentions. On the day of the crucial meeting, with a mixture of fear and anticipation, Nelson walked into the board room to witness the downfall of his nemesis. As Michael's presentation unfolded with the numerous changes and inaccuracies, the clients became increasingly agitated and confused, negatively affecting the meeting's atmosphere. The fallout from this disastrous event was as devastating as Nelson had envisioned. The firm did not secure the esteemed client, and Michael's reputation suffered an immense hit. The management called for an immediate investigation into the matter that uncovered the fabricated emails, which further destroyed Michael's credibility. In the end, Nelson's malicious efforts to ruin Michael's career were successful, and the once-promising speaker and firm advocate was fired. Unbeknownst to those involved, Nelson's thirst for revenge drove him to bury his rival's career, leaving a trail of destruction and disappointment in its wake. Michael, a victim of Nelson's envy and rage, was left with little but his shattered ambitions and a tarnished reputation, wondering how everything went so terribly wrong so fast."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans. But the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing. This is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents. \\"Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,\\" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. \\"But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes , they care about schools and the community.\\" Many believe that the civic education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote.

The lawmakers said, \\"We need to watch what these spies are doing, so we can make sure they're only doing what's right for everyone.\\" They decided to use their powers to oversee the spies' work. This means they would take a close look at what the spies were doing and make sure they were following the rules. By doing this, the lawmakers could make everyone in the land feel safe in their homes and in their daily lives, knowing that the spies' actions were being watched by the people who make the rules. And they all lived happily ever after, in a country where everyone knew they were being protected in a fair and just way."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Passage: Monteux first conducted the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (SFSO) in 1931, and in 1935 at the age of 60 he was offered the chief conductorship. He was doubtful about accepting, both on personal and on professional grounds. He did not want to leave the OSP, his wife did not want to live on the west coast of America, and the orchestra was so low in funds that it had been forced to cancel an entire season in 1934. Like most orchestras the SFSO had been badly hit financially by the depression, and it suffered the further difficulty that many of its former players had left for better-paid jobs in Hollywood studios. That problem was exacerbated by the insistence of the Musicians' Union that only local players could be recruited. Monteux nevertheless accepted the appointment. The SFSO concert season was never longer than five months a year, which enabled him to continue working with the OSP, and allowed him to conduct the inaugural concert of the NBC Symphony Orchestra on 13 November 1937. In The New York Times Olin Downes wrote that the new orchestra was \\"of very high rank\\" and that the broadcast concert had displayed Monteux \\"at the height of his powers.\\"The Times said of Monteux's time in San Francisco that it had \\"incalculable effect on American musical culture\\", and gave him \\"the opportunity to expand his already substantial repertory, and by gradual, natural processes to deepen his understanding of his art.\\" Monteux consistently programmed new or recent music. He generally avoided, as he did throughout his career, atonal or serial works, but his choice of modern works nevertheless drew occasional complaints from conservative-minded members of the San Francisco audience. Among guest conductors with the SFSO during Monteux's years were John Barbirolli, Beecham, Otto Klemperer, Stokowski and Stravinsky. Soloists included the pianists George Gershwin, Rachmaninoff, Arthur Rubinstein and Schnabel, the violinists Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin and the young Isaac Stern, and singers such as Kirsten Flagstad and Alexander Kipnis.

No We cannot draw the conclusion that Saudi Arabia produces more oil than any other country based on the provided information. The information provided discusses that Saudi Arabia's production mix is shifting toward lighter crudes. However, this does not give any information about the comparative production volume of oil with other countries. While it is true that Saudi Arabia is a leading oil-producing country, we need data comparing their oil production with other oil-producing nations to confirm whether they produce more oil than any other country. Some of the world's top oil producers (apart from Saudi Arabia) include the United States, Russia, Canada, and China, among others. To determine whether Saudi Arabia is the top oil-producing country or not, one would need to obtain comprehensive production data for these countries and compare their output. Moreover, oil production volumes can change over-time, and different sources might provide slightly different estimates.

She was the second daughter and youngest child born to King Lysimachus from his first wife, Nicaea of Macedon. Arsinoe I had two older siblings: a brother called Agathocles and a sister called Eurydice. - Agathocles ( Greek : ; born between 320 -- 310s BC -- died 284 BC ) was a Greek Prince who was of Macedonian and Thessalian descent . He was the son born to Lysimachus from his first wife the Queen consort , Nicaea a daughter of the powerful regent Antipater . His full blooded siblings were his younger sisters : Eurydice and Arsinoe I. Agathocles was sent by his father against the Getae , about 292 BC , but was defeated and taken prisoner . He was kindly treated by Dromichaetes the king of the Getae , and sent back to his father with presents ; but Lysimachus , notwithstanding , marched against the Getae , and was taken prisoner himself . He too was also released by Dromichaetes , who received in consequence the daughter of Lysimachus in marriage . According to some authors it was only Agathocles and according to others only Lysimachus , who was taken prisoner . In 287 BC Agathocles was sent by his father against Demetrius I Poliorcetes , who had marched into Anatolia to deprive Lysimachus of Lydia and Caria . In this expedition he was successful ; he defeated Demetrius I and drove him out of his father 's provinces . Agathocles was destined to be the successor of Lysimachus , and was popular among his subjects . His stepmother Arsinoe II , prejudiced the mind of his father against him and after an unsuccessful attempt to poison him , Lysimachus cast him into prison and had him executed ( 284 BC ) . His maternal cousin - wife and now widow Lysandra with their children fled with Alexander ( Agathocles ' paternal half - brother ) to Seleucus I Nicator in Syria , who made war upon Lysimachus in consequence . Louis Robert has suggested that coins of 300 BC belong to an Agathocleia city in Mysia founded by Agathocles . - Brunei, officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (Jawi: ), is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, the country is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012. - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - Lysimachus (Greek: , \\"Lysimachos\\"; c. 360 BC 281 BC) was a Macedonian officer and diadochus (i.e. \\"successor\\") of Alexander the Great, who became a basileus (\\"King\\") in 306 BC, ruling Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedon. - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. What is the relationship between 'agathocles ' and 'nicaea of macedon'? The answer is:","completion":"Agathocles and Nicaea of Macedon were mother and son. Nicaea of Macedon was the first wife of King Lysimachus and the mother of Agathocles, who was a Greek Prince of Macedonian and Thessalian descent. Nicaea was the daughter of the powerful regent Antipater, making her a prominent figure in the Macedonian royal family. Agathocles was born between 320 and 310s BC and was the elder brother of Arsinoe I and Eurydice. As a prince, he played an active role in his father's kingdom, engaging in military campaigns and diplomatic affairs. However, his life was marked by tragedy, as he was eventually executed by his father in 284 BC under the influence of his stepmother, Arsinoe II.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years.

I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: There are two main types of hair extensions: synthetic and real hair. Synthetic extensions are cheaper, and readily found in beauty supply stores and \\"punk\\" stores, such as Hot Topic or Clairs. Real hair extensions are more expensive, and can be found in salons and beauty-supply stores. Unlike synthetic extensions, they can be straightened and curled. Some synthetic hair extensions are heat safe. The packaging will usually indicate up to what temperature it is safe to curl or straighten the hair. Decide where you want the streak, then slide the handle of a rat-tail comb through your hair, and use it to create a part. You never want to add an extension to the top of your head, because the comb and weft will be visible. Clip your hair out of the way, if needed. Find the comb part, and turn it so that the hair is facing you. Hold the comb between your thumbs and forefingers. Push down on the middle of the comb with one of your thumbs. You'll feel it click as it opens. Turn the extension so that the comb part is facing your head. Slide the comb into your hair, right below the part you made. Make sure that the teeth are catching in your hair. Press down on the sides of the extension with your fingers. You'll feel it snap shut against your head. If the extension is too long, you can cut it so that it matches the length of your natural hair. If you used an extension made from real hair, you can curl it or straighten it to match your hair texture. Cut upwards into the strand to thin out the ends and make them lay like real hair. Use a lower heat setting on your straightener or curling iron. A high-heat setting can damage an extension, even if it's made from real hair. Your hair will now cover the clip from the extension, making it look more realistic. At the end of the day, be sure to take the extension out. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the two primary types of hair extensions: synthetic and real hair. Synthetic extensions are more affordable and widely available in beauty supply stores and alternative shops like Hot Topic or Clairs, whereas real hair extensions are costlier and can be found in salons and beauty supply stores. Real hair extensions have the advantage of being suitable for styling with heat, unlike most synthetic ones, although some synthetic extensions are heat safe as indicated on their packaging. To apply a hair extension, use a rat-tail comb to create a part where you want the streak but not on the top of your head to avoid visibility. Clip excess hair out of the way, and hold the comb part of the extension facing you. Open the comb by pushing down and then turn it towards your head, sliding it into place right below the part, ensuring the teeth catch in your hair. Press down on the sides to snap it shut securely. If necessary, trim the extension to match your natural hair length. For real hair extensions, you can curl or straighten them to match your hair texture; just make sure to use a low heat setting to prevent damage. Thinning out the ends can also help the extension blend more naturally with your hair. Always remember to remove the extension at the end of the day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"One year for a planet refers to the time it takes for that particular celestial body to complete one full orbit around its star. In the context of Earth, one year is equivalent to approximately 365.25 days, during which our planet revolves around the Sun. However, the answer provided - \\"It is also the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets.\\" - is not an appropriate response to the question since it refers to another concept. The phrase is describing Earth's size in comparison to the other rocky terrestrial planets in our Solar System - Mercury, Venus, and Mars.

A more fitting answer to the question would be as follows: \\"To the planet Earth, one year signifies the duration of time it takes to complete a full orbit around the Sun.

Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems. Early adopters tended to use UCS-2 (the fixed-width two-byte precursor to UTF-16) and later moved to UTF-16 (the variable-width current standard), as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-BMP characters. The best known such system is Windows NT (and its descendants, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7), which uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding. The Java and .NET bytecode environments, Mac OS X, and KDE also use it for internal representation.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What concert tour did critics say was overproduced? , can you please find it? Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...

Input: Passage: The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ (at the opposite end from the mouth). Its main component is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia, called \\"balancers\\", that sense its orientation. The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia. A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers. Instead its response is determined by the animal's \\"mood\\", in other words the overall state of the nervous system. For example, if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey, it will often put some comb rows into reverse, spinning the mouth towards the prey. Question: What is the main component of the aboral organ? Output:","completion":"True"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.
