They later became integral to many episodes and stories as their role in the fictional universe developed. For the first eight years after the series resumed in 2005, the Time Lords were said to have been destroyed at some point between the original series' cancellation in 1989 and the show's revival during the fictional Last Great Time War. In 2013, the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" concerned this supposed destruction and their eventual survival. - Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963.

Fraternities and sororities provide a support system and foster growth and development for students. They focus on academics, leadership, and community service, while also offering a sense of belonging and camaraderie among the members. The Purdue Greek community encompasses a diverse group of fraternities and sororities, which are divided into four main councils: 1. Interfraternity Council (IFC): This council represents the majority of traditional men's fraternities on Purdue's campus. Around 40 fraternities are a part of this council. 2. Panhellenic Association (PHA): This council coordinates the activities of 22 women's sororities at Purdue University, ensuring the efficient and fair management of member sororities. 3. National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC): It consists of nine historically African-American fraternities and sororities, of which six are present at Purdue. They are committed to community service and the promotion of unity among their members. 4. Multicultural Greek Council (MGC): This council comprises various culturally-based fraternities and sororities. At Purdue, the MGC has about 12 member organizations that promote cultural diversity, academic achievement, and community service. While the exact number of students involved in Greek life at Purdue can vary from year to year, it is estimated that around 20% of undergraduates are members of fraternities and sororities.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters ‚Äì including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague ‚Äì he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians.

I was excited that there was a \\"nice\\" and \\"classy\\" place down the street. I went to eta for the first time last week on a Thursday and Lingo was behind the bar. Lingo was awesome, friendly and very attentive. I played the machines and just drank club soda with a lime which Lingo ensured my drink was never empty. Lingo informed me that they were having a party on Valentines night and encouraged me to check it out. On valentines day, My husband and I were at the sports bar having some drinks and the bartenders there were great and friendly, we ended up going back into eta for their party. I wanted my husband to experience the great service I have had the night prior.. That was until Amanda served us. We ordered 2 beers and Amanda told us the total, didn't even greet us, my husband made a comment about the beers being slightly higher than the race and sports bar, but I told my husband it was because eta offered entertainment. We paid for our beers without incident until Amanda stated to my husband \\"if you can't afford the drinks, go back to race and sports\\". I was shocked at this comment because my husband is a physician and money is not an issue for us. I told Amanda we weren't complaining and my husband was just confused. She continued to look at the gentleman next to us and say \\"I hate dealing with broke white trash\\". I told her she had no right to make those comments about us and that we paid without complaining and there was no reason for her to attack us. She proceeded to tell my husband and I that this would be our last beer there and told us to go to a bar that we could \\"afford\\". Needless to say, its unfortunate that 1 bad seed will ruin the great service that we received from Lingo. Judging by the other reviews, it looks like Amanda is an ongoing problem. I had requested to speak with a manager and waited almost a half hour with no manager to be seen. I encourage anyone who hasn't been there yet not to go there when Amanda is working. I have never been so disrespected by a bar tender before. Hopefully this casino will see this ongoing problem and handle it. It's very unfortunate to have such a great place close to home that we now will not go back to as long as this disrespectful young lady is there.

With its simple yet challenging gameplay, this app exceeds my expectations in every aspect, earning it a well-deserved 5-star rating. One of the things I love about Pixel Dungeon is the beautiful pixel-art design. The visual style is reminiscent of classic RPG games from the past, but it still maintains a fresh and polished look. The UI is easy to navigate, and the in-game sprites are detailed and attractive. The procedural generation of dungeons ensures that every playthrough is different, providing endless hours of replayability. The game expertly balances RNG with skillful choices in character development, item management, and combat strategy. As a result, each run feels genuinely exciting and rewarding. Character classes and the talent system add depth to the gameplay while providing further customization options for players. Additionally, the broad range of unique items and abilities keeps the gameplay fresh, as you never know what incredible combination you might come across on your next dungeon delve. One aspect I cannot overlook is the game's difficulty level. While Pixel Dungeon is undoubtedly challenging, it is this precise challenge that makes the game all the more rewarding in the end.

This article: The film tells of two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the Brazilian military government: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, a transgender woman in prison for having sex with an underage boy. Molina, who self-identifies as \\"she,\\" passes the time by recounting memories from one of her favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that's also a Nazi propaganda film. She weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens her up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over her shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two. As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if she succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group. When Molina declares herself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but she relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person Luis is in love with?, what is it ?

Answer:","completion":"Title: The Secret Dreamers Genre: Drama/Coming-of-age Plot: In a small, rural town where opportunities are scarce, there's a thriving garment factory called The Dream Weavers. The factory is known for hiring young girls to work their looms, and it is seen as a way to earn an honest living to support their families. When 12-year-old Fatima dreams of joining The Dream Weavers, she is met with opposition for being too young. Fatima lives with her widowed mother and younger siblings, struggling to make ends meet. With the pressure to provide for her family, Fatima is adamant about working in the factory despite her age. However, the factory is already crowded with young girls working, and the management is reluctant to hire anyone younger, fearing scrutiny from labor rights groups. Undeterred, Fatima befriends some of the older girls working in the factory, hoping they could help her join their ranks secretly. The girls devise a plan to let Fatima work without drawing attention, allowing her to learn the trade and earn a small income. However, as they quickly discover, the working conditions within the factory are far harsher than they appear from the outside. As the girls grow closer, they begin to share their dreams and aspirations. Fatima's dream of her own fashion line inspires the other girls to look beyond the confines of the factory. Together, they start brainstorming ways to create a better future not only for themselves but for their fellow workers too. The girls' unity sparks an idea for a plan; they opt to work together after hours at the factory on Fatima's project, using their combined skills to create unique and beautiful clothing designs. As their creations come to life, the girls start to believe in their dreams and the potential of creating a life beyond the factory walls. However, when the factory management discovers their secret project, the girls face immediate dismissal, putting their families' livelihoods in jeopardy. Determined to fight for their dreams and their rights as workers, Fatima and her friends join forces with the town's people, rallying support and raising awareness about the crucial need for better working conditions and fair treatment, regardless of age. The Secret Dreamers is a heartwarming and inspiring story that explores themes of friendship, resilience, and the power of dreams in the face of adversity.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

It is revealed that while they were there, James proposed to Kristen and she refused, claiming she is not ready for marriage yet. James calls his friend Mike to come pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a knock at the door, surprising to them both since the house is so remote and far from any civilisation for miles.

Premise: \\"a fuzzy little dog\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\"?","completion":"If the premise, \\"a fuzzy little dog,\\" is true, it provides us with certain information about the subject (a dog) being described. It tells us that the dog in question has a small size and a fuzzy or fluffy coat. However, this description does not offer enough specific information to definitively entail the hypothesis, \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\" To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, it is important to analyze both descriptions and evaluate their compatibility. The term \\"wooly\\" and \\"fuzzy\\" are similar in meaning. When describing a dog's coat, both terms imply that the texture of the dog's hair is soft and lofty or curly. While it is reasonable to assume that a fuzzy dog might have a wooly coat, it is not explicitly mentioned, so it does not guarantee that the premise \\"a fuzzy little dog\\" entails \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\" The word \\"little\\" appears in both the premise and hypothesis, specifying the small size of the dog. In this case, there is a compatibility in the descriptions, and this aspect of the hypothesis can be considered as entailed by the premise since both descriptions refer to a small-sized dog. However, the color of the dog is not mentioned in the premise \\"a fuzzy little dog.\\" The hypothesis specifies a \\"white pup\\" while the premise remains ambiguous in terms of the color of the dog's coat. Since there is no mention of the dog's color in the premise, it does not provide enough information to determine if the premise entails a dog with a white coat. Lastly, the premise refers to a \\"dog,\\" while the hypothesis mentions a \\"pup.\\" These terms can be almost synonymous in general conversation, as 'pup' is often used to refer to young dogs or used affectionately for dogs of any age. However, a pup is officially a young dog, usually below one-year-old. The premise does not specify the age of the dog, so it does not entail the dog's age, which is pre-determined by the term \\"pup.\\" As a result, there remains ambiguity regarding whether the premise entails the hypothesis. In conclusion, although there is some compatibility between the premise \\"a fuzzy little dog\\" and the hypothesis \\"A wooly, little white pup,\\" the premise does not provide sufficient specific information to definitively entail the hypothesis. The fuzziness of the coat does not guarantee wooliness, the color of the dog remains unspecified, and the age of the dog is ambiguous. Consequently, based on the available information, it cannot be definitively concluded that the premise entails the hypothesis \\"A wooly, little white pup.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Raiders were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss by Miami the previous day, but traveled to Philadelphia for a Christmas night game against the NFL-best 12-2 Eagles. After the Eagles punted on their first drive, Oakland drove to the Eagles' 42, but failed convert on fourth down. Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, playing for the injured Carson Wentz, then led the team down the field and opened the scoring on a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jay Ajayi to put the home team up 7-0. After the teams traded punts, Carr threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper to tie the game up early in the second quarter. Philadelphia found themselves in scoring position late in the half, but rookie kicker Jake Elliott missed a 33-yard try right before the half leaving the game tied at seven. Starting the second half, the Raiders moved into Philly's red zone, but were held out of the end zone and forced to settle for a field goal by Giorgio Tavecchio to take a 10-7 lead. On the Raiders' next possession, Carr was intercepted by CB Patrick Robinson ending the Raiders promising drive. Two plays later, Ajayi fumbled and the Raiders took over. However, on the first offensive play for the Raiders, Marshawn Lynch to lost his first fumble of the season and resulting in three turnovers in four plays. The Eagles used that possession to kick another field goal to tie things up at 10-each. Defensive efforts and poor offense by both teams caused them to trade punts again going into the fourth quarter. The Raiders, taking over close to midfield, marched into Eagles territory, but Tavecchio missed a 48-yard field goal to leave the game tied. On the Eagles' next drive, Foles threw an interception and the Raiders drove deep into Philadelphia territory poised to take the lead. However, Jalen Richard turned the ball over on a fumble, the Raiders third turnover of the game. Following punts by both teams, the Raiders took over near midfield with the opportunity to set up a potential game-winning drive. However, with less than a minute to go, Carr threw another pick, the Raiders fourth turnover in the game. Philadelphia used the momentum to close into field goal range, and Elliott connected on a 48-yard try to give the home team the lead with 22 seconds left. Oakland took over on their own 40 with all three timeouts, but moved nowhere. On fourth down, with three seconds left, the Raiders began to lateral the ball as the clock expired attempting to score, but ended up fumbling the ball and the Eagles Derek Barnett returned it for a touchdown. The Eagles took a knee on the extra point try. The Raider defense played well, allowing 216 yards to the Eagles, but the Raider offense lost three fumbles in the game and Carr threw two interceptions.

However, when discussing the rotation of a planet, it is essential to differentiate between the two types of rotation: a sidereal day and a solar day. A sidereal day refers to the time it takes for a planet to complete a full rotation on its axis relative to the background stars. Neptune's sidereal day is about 16 hours and 6 minutes. A solar day, on the other hand, refers to the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky as observed from the planet's surface. Due to Neptune's highly-tilted axis (28.3 degrees) and its lengthy orbital period, its solar day is quite challenging to determine accurately.

Question: suppose less chemical compounds produced happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If human industry produces fewer chemical compounds, it will have a \\"less\\" effect on the damage caused by acid rain. Let's break down the process step-by-step and justify the answer: 1. Human industry produces chemical compounds: If fewer chemical compounds are produced, there will be a reduction in the amount of pollutants that contribute to acid rain. 2. Chemical compounds rise into the air: With a reduction in the chemical compounds produced, there will be fewer airborne pollutants that contribute to the formation of acid rain. 3. Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds: Since fewer chemical compounds are present in the air, the likelihood of these compounds interacting with the elements in clouds is reduced, which lowers the potential for more acidic rain to form. 4. The affected rain falls to the earth: Since fewer chemical compounds are mixing with elements in clouds, it's reasonable to expect that the subsequent rain will be less acidic. 5. The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content: Reduce acidity in the rain will have a \\"less\\" effect on the damage caused to natural and man-made objects by acid rain. Therefore, it is less likely to cause harm to the environment and infrastructure. In conclusion, reducing the production of chemical compounds in human industry will have a \\"less\\" effect on causing damage by acid rain. The supposed perturbation, in this case, influences the second effect mentioned by reducing the overall acidity of the rain, thereby causing less harm to natural and man-made objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

Author: Jefferson Chase es/kl (AFP, Reuters) ||||| BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The well-preserved wreck of a World War One German submarine, possibly still containing the bodies of its 23 crew members, has been found off the Belgian coast. The well-preserved wreck of a World War One German submarine, possibly still containing the bodies of 23 crew members, found off the Belgian coast, is seen in this handout picture provided by KB Vlaanderen on September 19, 2017. KB Vlaanderen- Tomas Termote/Handout via REUTERS The use of submarines, often referred to as U-boats, in World War One to disrupt British trade routes in the English Channel and the North Sea was a key part of German tactics. The 93 German U-boats stationed in Belgian ports downed more than 2,500 ships but were also a target themselves, with 70 of them lost at sea, killing 1,200 sailors. It was not yet clear which of the 11 known wrecks of the German submarines had been found, and authorities said they would not give the exact location of the wreck to deter looters. ‚ÄúOf the 11 downed U-Boats in Belgian waters, this one is the best preserved example,‚Äù the province of West Flanders said. Belgium‚Äôs North Sea minister said he would investigate whether the wreck could be recognized as a heritage site. ||||| An intact German submarine from the First World War containing the bodies of 23 people has been found on the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Belgium. The U-boat, a UB II-type submarine, was found between 82 and 98 feet below the surface, with damage to its upper deck. Carl Decaluwe, the governor of Western Flanders, said the find on the floor of the North Sea is ‚Äúunique‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite amazing that we found something like this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe impact damage was at the front, but the submarine remains closed and there are 23 people still onboard.‚Äù The boat, which is 88 feet long and 20 feet wide and was found encrusted with barnacles and seaweed, appears to have struck a mine. Two torpedo tubes have been destroyed but the lower tube is intact and closed. Decaluwe, who said the U-boat was found by researchers, declined to provide details about its location until the site has been protected. He has contacted the German ambassador because ‚Äúwe need to see what can do‚Äù with the remains. Around 18 U-boats were stationed with the Flanders Flotilla in Bruges between 1915 and 1918. Thirteen of them were destroyed and this is the 11th wreckage to be found in Belgian waters. Allied warships and cargo ships were easy pickings for the German subs that were launched from Bruges, just across the English Channel. A website, Uboat.net, tracks the submarines lost in both World War One and World War One, as well as casualties suffered by their staff. According to the BBC, of the 375 German submarines that set sail from German ports in World War One, 202 were lost in action, and of 17,000 men who served, more than 5,100 lost their lives. The German submarines, however, managed to sink 2,600 allied shipping vessels. Earlier this year, unseen photographs of German World War One submarines washed up on the English coast were published for the very first time. Historic England revealed the images to mark the centenary of Germany‚Äôs declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare on Britain. Last year, the a German U-boat was been discovered at the bottom of the sea off the Scottish coast.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation 18 = 4*w + 2 for the variable w, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable w on one side of the equation. In this case, we want to isolate 4*w, so we need to move the constant term (+2) to the other side of the equation. To do that, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 18 - 2 = 4*w + 2 - 2 This simplifies to: 16 = 4*w Step 2: Solve for the variable w. Now that we have the equation in the form of 16 = 4*w, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 4: 16/4 = 4*w/4 4 = w So, the solution to the equation 18 = 4*w + 2 is w = 4."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. and the situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. Answer the following question: Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","completion":"Stage B would see an increased pressure compared to stage C due to the changes in temperature that directly affect the kinetic energy of the gas molecules and their subsequent interactions with the container walls. In Stage A, the gas in the cylinder is at room temperature, which is 300 Kelvin. At this temperature, the gas molecules have a specific amount of kinetic energy, which is directly related to the pressure exerted by these molecules on the container walls as they collide against them. During Stage B, the gas is heated until the Kelvin temperature doubles to 600 Kelvin. As a result, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases. This increased kinetic energy leads to more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, causing the pressure of the gas to double as well. Consequently, Stage B experiences a higher pressure compared to Stage A due to the increased temperature. Finally, in Stage C, the gas is cooled down, which leads to a decrease in the Kelvin temperature. As the temperature decreases, so does the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This results in less forceful collisions against the container walls, and in turn, a decrease in the pressure exerted by the gas. Therefore, the pressure in Stage C is lower than the pressure in Stage A and significantly lower than in Stage B. In summary, Stage B would see an increased pressure compared to Stage C, as the higher temperature in Stage B results in more forceful collisions by the gas molecules against the container walls, leading to a higher pressure. Conversely, cooling the gas in Stage C leads to less forceful collisions and a lower pressure than Stage B."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sometimes, planes have to land in a place they didn't plan to because of an emergency. This is called an \\"emergency landing.\\" Now, think about a little book called a \\"passport\\" with your photo and some special stickers called \\"visas.\\" These visas allow you to visit different countries, just like a special ticket. Let's now talk about Question 1: What if the airplane makes an emergency landing and the people inside don't have the right visa for that country? Well, the country knows that it's an emergency and not the passengers' fault. So, they usually allow the people from the airplane to enter, but they keep an eye on them and make sure they leave the country soon. Question 2 is asking a similar thing: What happens if the airplane has to land in a place where people need a special visa (the pre-acquired ticket) before they arrive? It's the same answer as before! The country understands it's an emergency and will usually let passengers and crew in for a short time, but they'll need to leave soon.

Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff.

The western boundary with Spanish Texas was not fully defined until the Adams-On√≠s Treaty in 1819. A strip of land known as the Sabine Free State just east of the Sabine River served as a neutral ground buffer area from about 1807 until 1819. The Orleans Territory was the site of the largest slave revolt in American history, the 1811 German Coast Uprising.

Sentence 2: The design of this Japanese porcelain , white and blue according to European taste , with many flowers , has been made by Wagener . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"While these two sentences convey similar information, there are subtle differences in how the information is presented and the emphasis placed on certain aspects. The main idea common between both sentences is that Wagener designed a porcelain with white and blue flowers; however, the inspiration and description of the design are presented differently in each sentence. In sentence 1, the emphasis is on the fact that the European porcelain was designed by Wagener, and the design was influenced by the Japanese taste. The phrase \\"according to the Japanese taste\\" implies that the design elements borrowed from the Japanese aesthetics were made to appeal specifically to those with a preference for such styles. The sentence focuses on the origin of the porcelain, which is European, while highlighting the influence and inspiration from the Japanese taste. Sentence 2, on the other hand, emphasizes that the Japanese porcelain was designed by Wagener, incorporating white and blue colors and an abundance of flowers. However, this sentence indicates that the design was made \\"according to the European taste.\\" This phrasing suggests that the design elements were modified to cater specifically to European preferences. Interestingly, the origin of the porcelain in this sentence is Japanese, as opposed to the European origin in the first sentence. In summary, both sentences reflect that Wagener designed porcelain with white and blue flowers, and they convey the idea of a fusion of Japanese and European tastes. While they contain similar elements, the differences in sentence structure, emphasis, and descriptions provide a distinct perspective on the information that is being conveyed. The first sentence highlights a European porcelain inspired by Japanese taste, while the second sentence suggests a Japanese porcelain designed according to European taste.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose you are more successful during the great american smoke out happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The Great American Smokeout is an annual event that encourages smokers to quit smoking for at least one day, with the hope that they will eventually quit for good. By not smoking during this event, you would increase the chances of more oxygen being brought into your body. Here's how the perturbation hypothesis would affect the process, step-by-step: 1. When you breathe in air during the Great American Smokeout, there is a higher chance of the air being cleaner and containing more oxygen as there are fewer pollutants from cigarette smoke. 2. The air entering the bronchial tubes would thus have a higher oxygen concentration as it is less contaminated by cigarette smoke. 3. The air that gets split into the bronchioles of each lung would also contain more oxygen as a result. 4. The alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs, would have higher oxygen levels to work with. This means that more oxygen would be available to pass through the walls of the alveoli into the surrounding blood vessels. 5. With a higher amount of oxygen entering the bloodstream, more oxygen-rich blood would leave the lungs and travel through the body, providing more oxygen to the cells that need it. 6. As blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, the person might exhale slightly less carbon dioxide because the cells are using more oxygen and producing slightly less carbon dioxide. 7. When exhaling, carbon dioxide is released, but with slightly more oxygen in the system, the body should be more efficient at handling this gas exchange, leading to better overall health. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis, in this case, suggests that being more successful during the Great American Smokeout would have a direct effect on the process of oxygen exchange in the lungs and consequently lead to more oxygen being brought into the body. This would potentially improve the overall health and well-being of the individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don‚Äôt leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere.

During this period, they were acquired by collectors such as the British collector Richard Wallace (1818‚Äì1890), who purchased Count van Nieuwerkerke's (1811‚Äì1892) entire collection, including two boxwood prayer nuts, the Vienna-born collector of objets d'art Fr√©d√©ric Spitzer (1815‚àí1890), and Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839‚Äì1898).

Today, there are four surviving boxwood carvings he had augmented for the market.When the American financier J. P.

The question made no sense; Digger would not go anywhere. When he slept, he slept for ten hours. You could toss him around like a sack of potatoes, and he would not wake up. With one exception. \\"Bathroom?\\" Mrs. DeLyon shook her head. \\"No.\\" Mr. Drake said, \\"And he's not in any of the beds. We looked in all three.\\" Mrs. DeLyon said, \\"And under them.

Everything's fine now!\\" The dogs barked in response, but no person answered. Mrs. DeLyon said, \\"Call Dr. Lamont. Maybe Susan put him in the backseat and forgot to tell us.\\" Mr. Drake's voice held as little hope for that as Mrs. DeLyon's, but he said, \\"All right.\\" Mrs. DeLyon said, \\"We'll get Chris to bed in the meantime.\\" \\"I'm in charge,\\" I said. Ethorne said, \\"When there's nothing you can do, you might as well sleep. Save your strength for when you need it.\\" Mrs. DeLyon said, \\"Don't worry.

Lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the Eurovision Song Contest with a (not-so-heavy) metal song called \\"Hard Rock Hallelujah\\" and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters. But, let's face it, their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents. The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and ¬ñ even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event. The absolute last thing Lordi's first (and hopefully last) horror film brings is change and ingenuity. \\"Dark Floors\\", based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles, is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clich√©s. The immense budget (\\"Dark Floors\\" supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make-up art, but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people, among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness, become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown. When the doors open again, the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already. Trying to reach the exit, the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles, like eyeless corpses, screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors. The only three points I'm handing out to \\"Dark Floors\\" are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film. For as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation, the atmosphere is quite creepy, but as soon as you realize the explanation will a) be very stupid or b) never come, the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards. Lordi's costumes never really were scary to begin with (except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans) and, in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghost-horror, they just look downright pathetic and misfit. With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations, I personally always presumed Finland ¬ñ The Land of a Thousand Lakes ¬ñ would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales, but I guess that's another disillusion on my account.

The history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender.

Others focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules.

The question is about identifying two news domains that are country-independent. This question can be categorized as \\"Extractive\\" since the answer can be found within the context provided."},{"prompt":"I read this background article the other day: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. I am facing a new situation today: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, are they closer or farther?

There is, however, a hint of the international view in that Adama Barrow is referred to as the \\"internationally recognised president.\\" Step 4: Modify the hypothesis (if necessary) Since the context does not explicitly say that the international world celebrated the change, we need to modify the hypothesis to something more probable based on the information given.

Read this article and answer this question In 2001, Dominican livestock included 187,000 goats and 106,000 sheep. There were also about 2.1 million head of cattle, 60% for beef and 40% for dairy. The hog population was decimated by African swine fever, decreasing from 400,000 in 1978 to 20,000 in 1979; by 2001, however, it was 565,000. Poultry is the main meat source because it is cheaper than beef or pork. Poultry production relies on imports of feed grain from the United States. In 2001, 203,000 tons of poultry meat were produced, along with 71,000 tons of beef and 420,000 tons of milk.

Hypothesis: The man in the car is an FBI agent. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the premise provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the man in the car is an FBI agent. The premise states that \\"A man sits in a government vehicle on the street.\\" While it's true that FBI agents may use government vehicles as part of their job, this information alone is not sufficient to accurately and unambiguously determine the man's occupation or organizational affiliation. The term \\"government vehicle\\" is quite broad and can include many types of vehicles associated with various governmental branches, agencies, and job roles. This vehicle could be associated with law enforcement (local, state, or federal), emergency services (fire department, EMTs), the Department of Transportation, military, or even a civilian working directly or indirectly for the government. Moreover, there are numerous job titles and positions under the umbrella of the federal government, not limited to the FBI. The occupant of the vehicle could be a member of another federal law enforcement agency such as the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Secret Service, or U.S. Customs and Border Protection, among others. Alternatively, he could be a local or state law enforcement officer on assignment, an employee of a regulatory agency like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a government utility worker, or associated with a government-funded organization or contractor. Furthermore, the man could simply be a driver or a passenger in the vehicle, who may or may not be a government employee or affiliated with the FBI. The premise does not provide any specific identifying information, such as attire, behavior, or equipment that would point to the man being an FBI agent. For example, if the premise mentioned that the man wore a suit, had a badge or ID, and appeared to be conducting surveillance or an investigation, it would be much easier to support the hypothesis. In conclusion, even though it's possible that the man in the car could be an FBI agent, we cannot establish this with certainty based on the limited information provided in the premise.

(Associated Press) The pilot of the single-seat jet was headed to New Orleans for radar installation as part of routine maintenance and reported an inflight emergency, then lost radio contact, authorities said. The pilot and jet are with the 104th Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, officials there said. It was unclear whether the pilot had ejected and the plane had no munitions onboard, Col. James Keefe said at a news conference in Westfield, Massachusetts, home of the fighter wing. Just before 9 a.m., residents near Deerfield ‚Äî with a population of just 130 people, about 135 miles northwest of Richmond ‚Äî say they heard a series of explosion-like booms. \\"It's the loudest noise I've ever heard,\\" 63-year-old Rebecca Shinaberry, who lives on a farm about two miles away, said. \\"(It) just shook the ground, and from my house we could just see a big plume of smoke.\\" Her husband, turkey farmer A.D. Shinaberry, said that from the first two booms, he thought a plane had broken the sound barrier. But 10 seconds later he heard a third boom ‚Äî the crash, he said. Then, \\"it was like a mushroom, black smoke came up,\\" Shinaberry said. From the smoke, Virginia State Police said, they located the crash site, in a heavily wooded but level area adjacent to a mountain in the George Washington National Forest. A deep crater and a large debris field are on the site, and state police are searching, spokeswoman Corrine Geller said. \\"It is probably five, six miles from the crash site to the nearest civilization,\\" Keefe said. \\"It's deeply wooded, and a lot of hills and mountains.\\" \\"We are not going to speculate on what occurred or the status of the pilot,\\" Keefe said. \\"We are hopeful that the pilot is OK.\\" A massive rescue operation was underway in the rural area with rocky, steep terrain. More than 100 dozen local, state, and federal officials as well as volunteers gathered at the Deerfield Volunteer Fire Department. About a dozen helicopters from various agencies were used through the day to search. The aircraft were constantly taking off and landing throughout the day. Geller said later Wednesday rescuers on foot and horseback would search through the night, assisted by search dogs and helicopters equipped for night flying. Keefe said the plane was flying about 30,000 to 40,000 feet ‚Äî \\"pretty high\\" ‚Äî when the pilot reported the emergency. Pilots are trained to release equipment when ejecting, Keefe said, so it was likely the pilot did not have a radio. F-15s are maneuverable tactical fighters that can reach speeds up to 1,875 mph, according to the Air Force website. The F-15C Eagle entered the Air Force inventory in 1979 and costs nearly 30 million, the website says. The Air Force has nearly 250 F-15s. Several F-15s have crashed over the past few years in various states. In at least one, the pilot ejected safely. Causes included failure of a support structure for the jet and pilot error. __ Associated Press writers Michael Felberbaum in Richmond, Brock Vergakis in Norfolk, and Stephen Singer in Westfield, Massachusetts, contributed to this report. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A search continues for a missing Massachusetts National Guard pilot after his F-15C military jet crashed in a heavily wooded area of Virginia.

Here's a more detailed explanation: 1. –ù–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è (Napravleniya): This word means 'directions' or 'destinations' in Russian. It is the plural form of the noun '–Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ' (napravleniye), which in this context refers to the available routes or destinations that an airline offers. 2. –ê—ç—Ä–æ—Å–≤–∏—Ç (Aerosvit): This is the transliteration of the name of the airline \\"Aerosvit\\" into the Cyrillic script used in the Russian language. The name is retained in its original form while transliterating.

Article: No opera smells of the sea quite like Britten's Peter Grimes. The music makes us constantly aware of the sea's immensity, it's potential for threat, and the play of light on its waves. But the sea isn't just a special background, it weighs on the lives of the characters, offering them a living, but at a price. In the first act the laboured sound of the strings evokes the complete heaviness of the sailor's work, as they haul the boats up the shingle . Then a storm gathers which rages through the scene at the Inn, and stirs up an orchestral hurricane. Even when it's calm and favorable, the sea is inescapable. In the comfortable enclosed world of the opera house, this can only be suggested. In the production of Peter Grimes about to open at the Aldeburgh Festival, it will be really present, because the opera is taking place on the beach, the setting for much of the narrative of Britten's opera, and also the poem by the Suffolk poet George Crabbe that inspired it. This won't be the first opera production to be set in the actual landscape in which the action takes place. There's a well-known filmed production of Tosca shot in Castel Gandolfo in Rome, and a production of Donizetti's Anna Bolena was once mounted in the moat surrounding the Tower of London. But those were manageable urban landscapes, with comfortingly solid buildings to act as wind shields and acoustic blocks. On the Aldeburgh beach there's actually nothing, apart from a few boats, some whole, some wrecked. Here anything more complicated than walking the dog is hard to solve. The wind blows away one's words, so conversation is hard, and anything not tied down tends to blow away. The sliding shingle turns one's steps into a drunken stagger. The idea of performing an opera in these conditions seems quite _ -- an accusation Aldeburgh director Jonathan Reakie takes cheerfully on the chin. Why has he done it? \\"Well, Grimes is the opera of Britten's that's most associated with Aldeburgh, but it's never been produced at the Festival which he founded....

(iv) The narrator was trying to cure her cold . Answer the following question: Why did the narrator offer the colleague a glass of tea ?","completion":"The narrator's primary intention in this situation was to create a meaningful and heartfelt farewell for their colleague, who was moving on from working at Black & Spiro. Offering their colleague a glass of tea was a thoughtful gesture that is typically associated with nurturing and comfort. Morning tea serves as a social experience where individuals can come together, celebrate, connect, and communicate in a relaxed environment. In this case, the setting provided an opportunity to express gratitude and reminiscence over the memories and experiences they have shared together as colleagues. By organizing a special morning tea for their departing colleague, the narrator was demonstrating their care, appreciation and support for her. This thoughtful act allowed the entire team to gather together, reinforcing their bond and unity. It was an opportunity for everyone to share their thoughts, best wishes and words of encouragement with the individual who was moving on to a new chapter in her life. This farewell moment provided the narrator, as well as the entire team, with a chance to show their genuine interest in their colleague's future endeavors. Offering a glass of tea was both a symbolic and practical gesture, as it helped set the tone for an intimate, warm, and special gathering. Drinking tea together, in this context, was more than a simple beverage; it became an element for connection, community and human interactions, which are essential in moments of transitions like these. Therefore, the reason the narrator offered a glass of tea to their colleague was multifaceted: it was a caring gesture symbolizing support and warmth, a means of providing a comfortable atmosphere for the farewell event, and an opportunity to show their appreciation for the time and effort she invested while working together as a team. The simple act of sharing a glass of tea opened the door to many heartfelt emotions and memories, and served as the foundation for a beautiful farewell that the team, and especially the departing colleague, will treasure for a long time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.

Summarize this article: √ó Infant‚Äôs death at unlicensed Fairfield daycare now ruled a homicide FAIRFIELD ‚Äî The death of an infant at an unlicensed Fairfield daycare center in March has been ruled a homicide, police say. Deputy Police Chief Chris Lyddy confirmed that the 4-month old Shelton boy, who was found dead on March 22, died due to toxic levels of over-the-counter drugs in his system. The infant was first thought to have succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but extensive postmortem testing conducted over the months that followed revealed otherwise. Medical inspectors working the case told Fairfield detectives in July that the baby had extremely high levels of diphenhydramine, or Benadryl, in his blood. Now, police are investigating how the infant could have ingested such a heavy dose. To do so, they will need to determine whether the homicide was committed intentionally or accidentally due to negligence. Police have not made any arrests or pressed any charges on employees who manage the daycare. In addition to the death investigation, Fairfield Police said they will be pursuing criminal infractions against the makeshift daycare for operating out of a private home without a license. Diphenhydramine, most commonly known as Benadryl, is an antihistamine meant to treat moderate to severe cold symptoms in adults. The FDA warns against administering the medication to infants under two-years-old without a doctor‚Äôs supervision, due to increased risk of overdosing. For more information on the hazards of giving cough and cold medicine to infants, read this FDA disclaimer. ||||| Death of 4-Month-Old Baby at Connecticut Daycare Caused by High Levels of Benadryl: Police Toxicology tests on a 4-month-old boy whose March 22 death at an unlicensed home daycare in Connecticut was ruled a homicide show he died from high levels of Benadryl in his system, police say.\\"It's a parent's worst nightmare and our hearts are broken for the parents of this young child,\\" Fairfield Police Chief Gary MacNamara tells PEOPLE. \\"We have an obligation to the parents to do a thorough investigation and determine who is responsible for this.\\"Since the death of Adam Seagull, the home-based daycare has been shuttered by state officials, according to MacNamara, who says the child wasn't sick at the time of his death and his body showed no signs of trauma.MacNamara tells PEOPLE that while no charges have been filed yet, someone at some point will be held accountable for Adam's death.\\"The consumption of the medication wasn't accidental,\\" says MacNamara. \\"This baby was 4-months-old. Someone administered Benadryl to this child. I am not saying there was intent to kill the baby, but as a result of that Benadryl, this child died. We are working to determine who, when and why this baby was given these meds.\\"MacNamara says Adam's death should serve as a cautionary tale for parents.\\"This daycare center had been operating without the proper licensing,\\" the chief says. \\"Without that licensing, there are no checks and balances. Without the proper training, you can't ensure a child's safety.\\" ||||| Shelton infant‚Äôs death being investigated as a homicide by Fairfield Police FAIRFIELD - What was originally believed to be a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is now being investigated as a homicide. The infant, Adam Gregory Vasaturo Seagull, was called \\"little prince,\\" \\"tootie muffin,\\" and \\"little man\\" by his family. ‚ÄúHis infectious smile brought immediate joy to everyone who had the privilege of experiencing it,‚Äù his obituary read. ‚ÄúAs he would look at you with his beautiful brown eyes, your heart became bigger and fuller with love.‚Äù Deputy Police Chief Chris Lyddy confirmed Saturday the death of the 4-month old Shelton boy in March at an unlicensed home day care has been ruled a homicide. According to the state medical examiner, toxicology reports showed high levels of Benadryl in the infant‚Äôs system. ‚ÄúThe investigator is being extremely diligent and to date, we have not been able to rule out anybody,‚Äù Lyddy said. The unlicensed day care was run by Carol Cardillo at her home at 63 Edgewood Road and had been in operation for 11 years, Lyddy said. A lawyer representing Adam‚Äôs parents, Matthew and Michelle, confirmed that the family is aware that the case is being investigated as a homicide. The lawyer, along with Adam‚Äôs grandfather, Lewis Seagull, said that they were not ready to comment on the development in the case. The police announcement comes just days after the death of Stamford 2-month-old girl was also ruled a homicide. That child was rushed to the hospital from an East Side day care facility with severe head trauma. Neighbors of Cardillo, the woman who ran the day care where Adam was found dead on March 22, were surprised to learn that the case was being investigated as a homicide. Dimitri Gregorio, 19, was away at college in March when Adam died but heard the news through text messages from his mother, including images of first responders lining the normally quiet and uncluttered Edgewood Road. He has watched children coming to and from for years. ‚ÄúThe family is very nice, the mother, the grandmother‚Äîthey‚Äôre very nice,‚Äù he said. Cardillo did not return requests for comment by phone and at her home. A relative confirmed that she still resides there. ‚ÄúShe was so sad,‚Äù said Cliff, a neighbor of Cardill‚Äôs who asked that his last name not be used, of Cardillo‚Äôs reaction after the accident. ‚Äú(Intentional wrongdoing) is last thing that I would expect; it‚Äôs a wonderful family.‚Äù Police were called to the home March 22 just after 3 p.m., when Cardillo dialed 911 to report an unresponsive infant. According to Lyddy, Deputy Police Chief, Cardillo told police the baby had been given a bottle around noon and then put down in a play crib for a nap. When she went to check on the baby around 2:55 p.m., she could not wake him up. There were seven other children being cared for at the time, five toddlers and two other infants. There were four adults in the home at the time, according to the report. ‚ÄúThe baby had not been sick, and there were no signs of trauma,‚Äù Lyddy said, which led to the belief that SIDS was the cause of death. However, due to the fact that the death was untimely, the infant‚Äôs body was sent to the state medical examiner‚Äôs office for an autopsy. The autopsy concluded the baby died from acute diphenhydramine intoxication. Lyddy said Cardillo has denied administering Benadryl to the baby. The day care center has been closed since the incident, and any charges regarding the operation of an unlicensed day care center would likely come from state authorities, Lyddy said. As for criminal charges in the baby‚Äôs death, Lyddy said, ‚ÄúIt is very much an active investigation.‚Äù He said it is possible that it could be determined the Benadryl overdose was accidental, ‚Äúbut certainly, negligence would be a factor in administering a lethal dose of anything to an infant‚Äù and could still result in criminal charges. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important that parents check into day care facilities,‚Äù Lyddy said. ‚ÄúThere are several ways to check if a center is licensed. The easiest is call 211, and you would be provided with a list of licensed day care facilities in your area.‚Äù He said parents should also check to make sure a facility has the proper child to staff ratio and that caregivers are properly trained in first aid, including CPR. |||||","completion":"An infant's death at an unlicensed daycare center in Fairfield in March has been ruled a homicide due to high levels of over-the-counter drugs found in his system.

The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States. After 37 years of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that they would embark on their final world tour, which began that May and is estimated to wrap up in 2019 or 2020.","completion":"1.

Here is a news article: HORRY COUNTY, SC (WMBF) ‚Äì Bond was denied for the 33-year-old mother of missing 'Baby Grace' at a hearing Thursday morning while officials continue to search a Socastee creek for the missing 5-month-old girl. Sarah Lane Toney was denied bond on the charge for which she was arrested Wednesday: unlawful conduct toward a child. She will remain incarcerated at the J. Reuben Long Detention Center. During the hearing, Toney said she went into the water with the baby, and couldn't hold on to her when the current sucked her in. She said that she did not intentionally put Baby Grace in danger. She did not explain why she was in the creek in the first place. \\"I went in the water with her and I was unable to hold her,\\" Toney said during the hearing. \\"I didn't intentionally put her in anything - any danger. I was going with her and I wasn't able to hold on to her when the water sucked me in.\\" On the day of the incident, Toney reportedly told a neighbor that she threw the infant into the creek in Socastee, according to police. The solicitor and prosecutor asked the judge to deny bond based on Toney's criminal history, specifically a domestic violence charge, and her record from Washington state. Toney said she does not have any money, so she is not a flight risk. Bond was denied based on her criminal history, and the on-going investigation into the disappearance of Toney's child. \\"I have no where to go, I'm not going to go anywhere, I have no money, I have no way to go anywhere. I'd like to be with my other child until we find Grace,\\" Toney said during the hearing. The search continues Thursday Divers with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and several other agencies stopped searching at dark Wednesday for the missing five-month-old girl whose mother claimed she threw her daughter in a creek in Socastee Tuesday morning. The Horry County Police Department tweeted Thursday morning that they resumed the search for Baby Grace, and informed residents nearby that search parties are moving about. Lt. Denis said that they have expanded their search area, and are now looking in ditches and other areas in the neighborhood. They are also able to search deeper into the woods, as the creek waters have receded about four feet since Tuesday. He said they are hoping to bring out SLED helicopters to assist with the search. Horry County Police asked that onlookers and prospective volunteers to \\"stay put for now\\" and monitor the situation on social media. \\"If we determine that we volunteers are needed we will post it on our social media sites along with instructions as how to help,\\" a post on the Horry County Police Facebook page states. The mother of the 5-month-old infant who was lost in rushing creek waters behind their Socastee home Tuesday, was arrested on an outstanding, unrelated warrant, according to police. Officers said 33-year-old Sarah Lane Toney, of Myrtle Beach, was being held at J Reuben Long Detention Center. On Wednesday, Lt. Denis said Toney is being charged with unlawful conduct toward a child. Detectives with HCPD have secured an arrest warrant for Toney and say the warrant will be served by the end of the day on Wednesday.

By about 9:30 a.m., more crews showed up for the search, and some volunteers were seen in the area, wondering how they can help find Baby Grace. Crews were working in the same area as they did Tuesday, according to Lt. Raul Denis, in a location about one mile to one half-mile up and down the creek and in the woods. Other organizations assisting in the search include the CUE Center for Missing Persons, the State Law Enforcement Division, as well as officials from Darlington County and a K-9 tracking team from Hartsville Police. Lt. Denis said K-9s did pick up a scent in one area of the creek Wednesday afternoon and divers are focusing on that area but crews have not found Baby Grace. Coastal Carolina University also sent in people with high-tech sonar equipment, which can usually find items, but may have difficult locating a small baby. Lt. Denis said they're patrolling a small concentrated area, and hope to be able to resolve this by Wednesday. The water level in the creek has dropped about one foot since Tuesday from its previous level of 6 to 7 feet, Lt. Denis said. However, the creek is usually only a foot or two deep. Search efforts come up empty on Tuesday Toney was found on a back porch by another homeowner, according to Horry County Police. Toney told the homeowner that she went into the river with the baby, later identified by police as Baby Grace, but she didn't have a baby with her at the time. Horry County Police detectives, Beach Patrol officers, Horry County Fire Rescue and South Carolina DNR, mobilized and searched the creeks, ponds, waterways, and woods in the area.

Denis. When police arrived at Simms Drive to investigate, Toney was home and was taken into custody. Lt. Denis confirmed on Wednesday that Toney's 9-year-old daughter was released to her biological father. A K-9 team tried to trace the woman's path to determine if she really was in the area of the creek, which is about a quarter-mile from the home on Simms Drive. Fire rescue responders, beach patrol officers, boats, jet skis, and canoes were in creeks all the way down to Intracoastal Waterway trying to find Baby Grace and investigate. One neighbor watched the scene unfold from her porch. She said she never had a conversation with Toney, but she had seen her with the baby. \\"We see her maybe once and a while, walking up and down the street with her,\\" said the neighbor. \\"Not really sure what's going on, but I am a little shocked.\\" Lt. Denis said Toney is in custody while the investigation is going on. Police also said the mother was transported to a Conway hospital to get medical clearance.

Upon her arrest Wednesday, Lt. Denis said, ‚Äúthe warrant was obtained in response to what‚Äôs occurred so far and that could change. Depending on how this goes. If we find the baby or not find the baby, things could change.‚Äù Toney was booked into the J. Reuben Long Detention Center Wednesday at 6:23 p.m., adds Lt. Denis. Her next court appearance is scheduled for December 11 at 1:00 p.m. Horry County police and other search teams returned to Socastee to continue the search for the missing 5-month-old child Wednesday morning. The Community United Effort (CUE) Center for Missing Persons, traveled from Wilmington, NC to Socastee to aid police in the search for baby Grace. Police say Toney claimed to have lost her baby in a Socastee creek Tuesday morning. Crews called off the search Tuesday night for the missing Socastee baby after water began to rise. According to Lt. Raul Denis, a homeowner reported finding a woman, later identified as Toney, on her back porch. The initial call to officers was in reference to a suspicious person around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday. Toney then reportedly told the homeowner she went into the creek with her child, Lt. Denis adds. Investigators revealed that Toney lost her baby in a rushing creek behind a home on Simms Drive. Toney was transported to Conway Hospital for ‚Äúmedical clearance‚Äù while officials searched for the child Tuesday afternoon. ‚ÄúAnything she tells us has to be investigated and corroborated,‚Äù explained Denis. Detectives canvassed Simms Drive while talking to neighbors. Kaylee White lives in the neighborhood and says she‚Äôs seen Toney out walking. ‚ÄúI have two babies of my own; I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing anything to them,‚Äù stated White. Rescue crews discontinued their search for the infant Tuesday at sunset, says Lt. Denis. The water became too high and too fast for crews to continue the search. Officers returned to search for the baby at 8 a.m. Wednesday morning. ‚ÄúThe water is really fast and turbulent so it‚Äôs not ideal for any diver to be in it,‚Äù said Denis. The baby named Grace is 5-months-old, according to Lt. Denis. Police k-9 agents were called to the scene to aid in the search for the child. Lt. Denis said officers were on scene, along the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Horry County Fire Rescue, conducting an investigation. Horry County Police released a photo of the baby shortly after the search began. According to Lt. Denis, Toney was later arrested on an outstanding, unrelated warrant and is being held at the Horry County Detention Center. Online booking records show that Toney has been arrested twice within the past 12 months. Toney was booked into the jail March 6 at 9:03 a.m. for criminal domestic violence, third or subsequent offense. She was released on 5,000 bond the following day. Toney was also jailed in November 2014 for numerous drug charges. Online booking records confirm Toney was booked November 6, 2014 on charges of giving false information to police, possession of marijuana, possession of a controlled substance, shoplifting, manufacturing crack cocaine, and possession of contraband by prisoner. ||||| Horry County police are searching for a 5-month-old baby after a woman lost the baby in a rushing Socastee creek Boats, canoes, divers, jet skis, and scores of officers searched for the baby, who is still missing Mother in police custody while search is ongoing ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A 33-year-old mother, Sarah Lane Toney, was denied bail on the charge of unlawful conduct towards a child after the disappearance of her 5-month-old daughter, known as \\"Baby Grace.\\" Toney claimed that she went into the water with the baby, but couldn't hold on to her when the current pulled them in. The reason for entering the creek was not explained. Officials expanded their search area around a Socastee creek, including ditches and neighborhood areas, with search parties moving through the area. Toney's criminal history, including a domestic violence charge, contributed to the judge's decision to deny bail. Search efforts by various organizations, including South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, were conducted in the surrounding woods, creeks, and waterways. The Horry County Police Department advised onlookers and potential volunteers to monitor the situation on social media. K-9 units picked up a scent in one area of the creek, on which divers focused their search, but initially Baby Grace was not found. Baby Grace's body was later found in Socastee creek. Search crews discovered the infant's body in the water after searching for nearly 48 hours.

The paragraph states that \\"You rifle through your visual memory and there it is: Vermeer, the 17th-Century Dutch artist who painted extraordinary portraits of women engaged in the ordinary.\\" This statement implies that not only do you remember who Vermeer was, but you also recall specific details about him and the subject matter of his paintings. Johannes Vermeer was a Dutch painter active during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century. Born in 1632 in Delft, Netherlands, he is known for his astonishing attention to detail, depictions of light, and the realistic portrayal of his subjects. He focused primarily on domestic scenes, giving prominence to ordinary women engaged in everyday activities. Vermeer's most recognizable work, \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" is an excellent example of his ability to capture subtle expressions and the play of light on the subject. Other well-known works of his include \\"The Milkmaid,\\" where a woman is depicted pouring milk from a jug, and \\"Woman Holding a Balance,\\" which showcases a woman weighing jewelry. In the provided paragraph, the person recalls who Vermeer was (a 17th-century Dutch artist), as well as specific details about the type of subjects he painted (women engaged in the ordinary). This demonstrates that the person has a clear memory of Vermeer and his work. In conclusion, based on the information in the paragraph, the hypothesis \\"I couldn't remember who Vermeer was or anything about him\\" is not true.

Since the user refers to it as an \\"addiction\\", it's likely they spend a significant amount of time on it. Step 1: Context Identification Based on the context given, the '360' seems to refer to a gaming console, probably Xbox 360. The user mentions it as somewhat of an addiction and as part of a list of technology devices, which would usually include gaming systems. Step 2: Analyzing the result of '360' removal The following outcomes can be extrapolated: 1. More Free Time: Firstly, if the user got rid of the Xbox 360, they might find that they have more free time, as they are no longer spending hours playing on the console. 2. Focused Attention: The user stated that they're trying to tackle one addiction at a time. If they manage to overcome their Xbox 360 addiction, this could mean that they can focus their attention towards managing other addictions (like their computer as mentioned). 3. Behavioral Adjustment: Removing such a central part of a daily routine could result in withdrawal symptoms initially, leading to a period of adjustment. Over time, however, this could lead to an overall healthier lifestyle, especially if the time previously spent on the gaming console is used for more productive activities. 4. Possible Replacement: There's a risk that the user might replace this addiction with another unless they actively work on developing healthier habits. Step 3: Concluding the answer So, by getting rid of the 360, the user might face a mix of these situations. Ultimately, the user's discipline and attempts at managing time and controlling their tendencies will decide the final outcome."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: One night in Portsmouth, England in 1787, a press gang breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.

Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take home, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Old Street is a street in central and east London that runs west to east from Goswell Road in Clerkenwell, in the London Borough of Islington, to the crossroads where it meets Shoreditch High Street (south), Kingsland Road (north) and Hackney Road (east) in Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney. - Shoreditch High Street is the old main street of Shoreditch, London. It is part of the A10 road and connects Norton Folgate to the south with Kingsland Road to the north. It constitutes a segment of the Roman Ermine Street, which ran directly north from London to Lincoln and York. The parish church of St Leonard's, Shoreditch is situated at the north-east end of the road at the crossroads where it meets with Hackney Road. This part of the road is wholly within the London Borough of Hackney; below Boundary Street, the eastern side lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large.

Question: Process: - The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose - The sound waves hit an object - Echoes are produced - The echo returns to the bat&#x27;s ears - The bat hears the echo - The bat can figure out where the object is located. Question: suppose If bats are in a cave happens, how will it affect WEAKER echolocation. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"In a cave environment, weaker echolocation can be affected in the following ways: 1. More effect: In the confined space of a cave, sound waves may bounce off multiple surfaces, creating more echoes. These additional echoes make it more challenging for bats with weaker echolocation to accurately pinpoint the location of objects or prey. This could lead to increased interference and confusion for the bat. 2. Less effect: On the other hand, caves may also provide some advantages to weaker echolocation. Due to their enclosed spaces, sound waves might not have to travel as far before they encounter an object and produce an echo, potentially making detections more accessible for bats with weaker echolocation. 3. No effect: In some cases, bats with weaker echolocation may adapt their strategies within a cave environment to compensate for the limitations of their echolocation ability. They might rely more on other senses, such as touch or smell, or utilize social cues from other bats to navigate their surroundings. In these instances, the perturbation in the cave environment might not have a significant effect on bats with weaker echolocation. In summary, the effect of a cave environment on weaker echolocation largely depends on the specific conditions and adaptations of each individual bat. It could lead to more interference and difficulty in pinpointing objects (more effect), make detections more accessible due to confined spaces (less effect), or have no significant impact if the bat can adapt and find alternative strategies (no effect)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Our equation is: -41843 * l - 1728 = -41789 * l We need to find l. First, let's move this -41789 * l to the other side of the equation. That means we need to add 41789 * l to both sides. When we do that, we get: -41843 * l + 41789 * l - 1728 = 0 Now, let's see what happens when we add -41843 * l and 41789 * l together. It will become: (-41843 + 41789) * l - 1728 = 0 When we do the math in the parentheses, we get: -54 * l - 1728 = 0 Now, let's make this equation look a bit friendlier. We will move the 1728 to the other side by adding 1728 to both sides of the equation: -54 * l = 1728 Finally, to find the value of l, we need to divide both sides by -54: l = 1728 / -54 When we do the division, we find out that l is equal to: l = -32 So, the answer is l = -32.

The Etruscan civilization () is the modern name given to a powerful and wealthy civilization of ancient Italy in the area corresponding roughly to Tuscany, western Umbria and northern Lazio. As distinguished by its unique language, this civilization endured from before the time of the earliest Etruscan inscriptions (c. 700 BC) until its assimilation into the Roman Republic, beginning in the late 4th century BC with the Roman-Etruscan Wars. Culture that is identifiably Etruscan developed in Italy after about 800 BC, approximately over the range of the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture. The latter gave way in the 7th century BC to a culture that was influenced by Ancient Greek culture. The ancient Romans referred to the Etruscans as the Tusci or Etrusci. Their Roman name is the origin of the terms \\"Tuscany\\", which refers to their heartland, and \\"Etruria\\", which can refer to their wider region. In Attic Greek, the Etruscans were known as Tyrrhenians (Turrenoi, Turrhenoi, earlier Tursenoi Tursenoi), from which the Romans derived the names Tyrrheni, Tyrrhenia (Etruria), and Mare Tyrrhenum (Tyrrhenian Sea), prompting some to associate them with the Teresh (Sea Peoples). The word may also be related to the Hittite Taruisa. The Etruscans called themselves Rasenna, which was syncopated to Rasna or Rasna. The origins of the Etruscans are mostly lost in prehistory, although Greek historians as early as the 5th century BC repeatedly associated the Tyrrhenians (Turrhenoi/Turrenoi, Tursenoi/Tursenoi) with Pelasgians. Thucydides, Herodotus and Strabo all denote Lemnos as settled by Pelasgians whom Thucydides identifies as \\"belonging to the Tyrrhenians\\" (to de pleiston Pelasgikon, ton kai Lemnon pote kai Athenas Tursenon), and although both Strabo and Herodotus agree that Tyrrhenus/Tyrsenos, son of Atys, king of Lydia, led the migration, Strabo specifies that it was the Pelasgians of Lemnos and Imbros who followed Tyrrhenus/Tyrsenos to the Italian Peninsula. The Lemnian-Pelasgian link was further manifested by the discovery of the Lemnos Stele, whose inscriptions were written in a language which shows strong structural resemblances to the language of the Tyrrhenians (Etruscans). Dionysius of Halicarnassus records a Pelasgian migration from Thessaly to the Italian peninsula, noting that \\"the Pelasgi made themselves masters of some of the lands belonging to the Umbri\\"; Herodotus describes how the Tyrrheni migrated from Lydia to the lands of the Umbri (Ombrikoi). Strabo as well as the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus make mention of the Tyrrhenians as pirates. Pliny the Elder put the Etruscans in the context of the Rhaetian people to the north and wrote in his Natural History (AD 79): Adjoining these the (Alpine) Noricans are the Raeti and Vindelici. All are divided into a number of states. The Raeti are believed to be people of Tuscan race driven out by the Gauls, their leader was named Raetus. Etruscan expansion was focused both to the north beyond the Apennine Mountains and into Campania. Some small towns in the sixth century BC disappeared during this time, ostensibly consumed by greater, more powerful neighbours. However, it is certain that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, Magna Graecia in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially copper and iron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean Sea. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century BC, when Phocaeans of Italy founded colonies along the coast of Sardinia, Spain and Corsica. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves with Carthage, whose interests also collided with the Greeks. Around 540 BC, the Battle of Alalia led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner, Carthage managed to expand its sphere of influence at the expense of the Greeks, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. From the first half of the 5th century BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480 BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by Syracuse, Sicily. A few years later, in 474, Syracuse's tyrant Hiero defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae. Etruria's influence over the cities of Latium and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and Samnites. In the 4th century BC, Etruria saw a Gallic invasion end its influence over the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Rome had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century BC. Etruscan art was produced by the Etruscan civilization between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (particularly lifesize on sarcophagi or temples), wall-painting and metalworking (especially engraved bronze mirrors). Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later). In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was apparently little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including Carrara marble, which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans. Most surviving Etruscan art comes from tombs, including all the fresco wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects. Bucchero wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery. There was also a tradition of elaborate Etruscan vase painting, which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market for Greek vases. Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colourfully painted terracotta antefixes and other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished. Etruscan art was strongly connected to religion; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art. The Etruscan musical instruments seen in frescoes and bas-reliefs are different types of pipes, such as the plagiaulos (the pipes of Pan or Syrinx), the alabaster pipe and the famous double pipes, accompanied on percussion instruments such as the tintinnabulum, tympanum and crotales, and later by stringed instruments like the lyre and kithara.

If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through organs According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill.

Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur. Which friend learned less about surface areas of root systems? Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant‚Äôs root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Bill, who studied about mycorrhiza, learned more about the surface areas of root systems. This is because mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant, and the mycelia of the fungi directly increase the surface area of the plant's root system, which in turn improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. On the other hand, Red studied hugelkultur, which is a method of creating raised garden beds by burying wood and other organic materials. While hugelkultur can also improve soil fertility and water retention, it does not focus on the surface areas of root systems like mycorrhiza does.

Question: Who does Mill have feelings for? Movie title: The Player Movie plot: Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a Hollywood studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow (Cynthia Stevenson). He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant) and Andy Sivella (Dean Stockwell), who pitch Habeas Corpus, a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker...

A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\". The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral A:","completion":"The final step of the process you described is the formation of a fossil. Throughout these stages, biological remains undergo a transition from organic materials into inorganic minerals, thus creating a fossilized representation of the original organism. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process: 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud: When organisms die, their remains can be preserved if they land in environments like soft soil or mud, which provide ideal conditions for fossilization due to minimal disturbance and low oxygen levels that inhibit decomposition. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains: Over time, layers of sediment such as mud, silt, or sand accumulate over the dead organisms. This sediment deposit provides protection from scavengers and physical factors like wind and water erosion. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts: As decomposition takes place, the soft tissues of the organisms break down, leaving only hard parts like bones, shells, or teeth. In some cases, even soft tissues may be preserved if the conditions are suitable. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals: Over thousands or millions of years, the remaining hard parts of the organism gradually become infused with minerals from the surrounding sediment. This process, called permineralization, happens when mineral-rich groundwater seeps into the voids within the bones or shells, depositing minerals that gradually replace the original organic matter and strengthen the structure. The final step, fossil formation: The result of this entire process is the formation of a fossil, a solid, mineralized representation of the original organism. Over time, geological processes may cause these fossils to become exposed at the Earth's surface, where they can be discovered and studied by scientists to learn more about the history of life on our planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mitt Romney‚Äôs ‚Äòhijinks‚Äô was and is bullying A lot has been said about Mitt Romney, his rather aggressive high-school ‚Äúhijinks‚Äù and his ‚Äútroubling reaction‚Äù to the story in The Post. But I want to slightly take issue with and then expand on something Ruth Marcus wrote in her post. ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt really blame Romney for what he did.

To be fair, she is saying that Romney‚Äôs juvenile knucklehead teenage behavior shouldn‚Äôt be held against him, especially since it was nearly 50 years ago and that we all are not the people we were in those formative years. At least we hope not. But what Romney is alleged to have done was physically and emotionally violent. Take a careful look and you won‚Äôt find the word bully or bullying in The Post story. But that‚Äôs exactly what those incidents detailed in Jason Horowitz‚Äôs story are. And while those incidents happened in the 1960s, they are the same kind of bullying that is happening today. Actually, today the harm can not only come from a fist or a pair of scissors. It can come via text message, Instant Message, Facebook, You Tube and any other medium that allows private insult to become public humiliation in seconds. Millions of kids ‚Äî boys and girls, straight, gay or perceived to be gay ‚Äî suffer indignities every day in their schools and in their neighborhoods.

Gilbert \\"Gil\\" Scott-Heron (April 1, 1949 - May 27, 2011) was an American soul and jazz poet, musician, and author, known primarily for his work as a spoken-word performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was \\"bluesologist\\", which he defined as \\"a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues\\". His music, most notably on the albums Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and foreshadowed later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. At the time of Scott-Heron's death, a will could not be found to determine the future of his estate. Additionally, Raquiyah Kelly-Heron filed papers in Manhattan, New York's Surrogate's Court in August 2013, claiming that Rumal Rackley is not Scott-Heron's son and should therefore be omitted from matters concerning the musician's estate. According to the Daily News website, Rackley, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters have been seeking a resolution to the issue of the management of Scott-Heron's estate, as Rackley stated in court papers that Scott-Heron prepared him to be the eventual administrator of the estate. Scott-Heron's 1994 album Spirits was dedicated to \\"my son Rumal and my daughters Nia and Gia\\", and in court papers Rackley added that Scott-Heron introduced me [Rackley] from the stage as his son.\\" . In 2011, Rackley filed a suit against sister Gia Scott-Heron and her mother, Scott-Heron's first wife, Brenda Sykes, as he believed they had unfairly attained US250,000 of Scott-Heron's money. The case was later settled for an undisclosed sum in early 2013; but the relationship between Rackley and Scott-Heron's two adult daughters already had become strained in the months after Gil's death. In her submission to the Surrogate's Court, Kelly-Heron states that a DNA test completed by Rackley in 2011--using DNA from Scott-Heron's brother--revealed that they \\"do not share a common male lineage\\", while Rackley has refused to undertake another DNA test since that time. A hearing to address Kelly-Heron's filing was scheduled for late August 2013, but, As of March 2016, further information on the matter is not publicly available. However, Rackley still serves as court-appointed administrator for the estate, and donated material to the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture for Scott-Heron to be included among the exhibits and displays when the museum opened in September 2016. According to the Daily News website, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters have been seeking a resolution to the issue of the management of Scott-Heron's estate.

By Jaquelyn Reingold. With Cynthia Nixon, Cecilia deWolf, Evan Handler, David Thornton, Tom Mardirosian, Jim Fyfe. Directed by Mary B. Robinson. At Ensemble Studio Theatre, 549 W. 52nd St. Tickets: 35. (212) 206-1515. With her midlife hangups, boyfriend problems and a biological clock that's quickly counting down, the borderline neurotic at the center of \\"String Fever\\" could easily be one of \\"Sex and the City's\\" catty quartet. It's unavoidable because the character is played by Cynthia Nixon, co-star of the HBO series. Despite \\"String Fever's\\" familiar premise and stock supporting characters, playwright Jaquelyn Reingold has fashioned a funny, offbeat and touching look at relationships. The wonderfully acted, small-scale production by Ensemble Studio Theatre is big on charm and long on laughs - even with a science-based subtext that ties a not-so-complicated love triangle to a complex physics theory. Nixon is excellent as Lily, a dowdy, insecure music teacher suffering from a devastating breakup with her troubled musician boyfriend, Matthew (David Thornton). It's her birthday. She is lonely. And she is thinking of having a baby through artificial insemination. Things start looking up for Lily when she meets Frank (Jim Fyfe), a charming, cat-loving physicist who's an expert on \\"string theory\\" - the idea that matter is made up of microscopic strings. Under Mary B. Robinson's brisk direction, \\"String\\" unspools as an appealing romantic comedy populated by oddball characters whose eccentricities never seem forced. Evan Handler, as Lily's goofy actor friend from Iceland, is a standout. A seasoned stage actress, Nixon gives a layered performance that's a pleasure to watch. As a teenager, she was in the original Broadway production of Lanford Wilson's \\"Fifth of July,\\" and she was a 1995 Tony nominee for \\"Indiscretions.\\" Her Lily has a vulnerable sweetness that can't hide a hair-trigger temper, the result of too many disappointments in love. \\"String Fever\\" was commissioned by the Sloan Foundation, which awards grants to playwrights who tackle sciencerelated topics. Though Lily uses string theory as a metaphor for her life, forget the physics and focus on the performances.","completion":"\\"String Fever\\" is a funny, offbeat, and touching play focused on relationships, featuring a small-scale production that is big on charm and laughs.

In the context given, samƒÅdhi is an integral part of the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism and is considered as \\"right concentration\\". This state is non-dualistic, meaning it transcends the dichotomy of subject-and-object, self-and-other, and all other binary constructs of reality and cognition. It implies a state of oneness or unity where distinctions and separations no longer exist. The cultivation of samƒÅdhi primarily occurs through meditation. As one develops samƒÅdhi, the mind is believed to become purified of defilement, achieving a state of calm, tranquility, and luminosity. This signifies a state of complete absorption where the meditator is fully engaged with the object of meditation and the sense of self is dissolved.

Sources close to \\"Chun-Li\\" rapper tell TMZ ... even though Cardi's shoe-throwing attack at the Harper's Bazaar party Friday night was a shock -- her security handled it and Nicki was totally fine. We're told Minaj was unscathed and nobody on her team was injured either ... so she sees no reason to file a police report and carry on with the drama. As for Cardi -- who was left with a lump on her head after the ruckus she started -- law enforcement tells us she hasn't filed a police report either. People connected to Cardi told us they believe she got the lump from being elbowed by someone on Nicki's security. We broke the story ... Cardi reached a breaking point after Nicki making comments about her fitness as a mom. Judging from Cardi's own words, she was looking for a fight. She never made contact, either with her fists or her shoe. Nicki played it super cool later while leaving the Plaza hotel ... and it seems she's still not letting it affect her ... at least outwardly. ||||| Sorry, this video isn't available any more. Cardi B has been accused of hurling her shoe at Nicki Minaj during a spat that broke out between the pair at this year‚Äôs New York Fashion Week. However it appears the rapper has a history of lobbing her shoes at her enemies, as Nicki isn‚Äôt the first person to fall victim to one of Cardi‚Äôs heels. Remember that time the 25-year-old slid off her stiletto on an episode Love & Hip Hop, and threw it at Asia without any warning? The pair were having a fight over Asia‚Äôs ex beau Swift after she was convinced Cardi had slept with him. When refusing to answer the question on what their beef was really about, Cardi took matters into her own hands and hurled her shoe at the then 24-year-old. At the time Swift spoke out on the drama and revealed why Cardi had got so wound up. Advertisement Advertisement Talking to Hollywood Life he said: ‚ÄòEven the host at the reunion show was asking Asia to explain, saying, ‚ÄúWhy you didn‚Äôt give her a chance?‚Äù‚Äò ‚Äò[But] Asia didn‚Äôt want to explain. So Cardi got mad and threw the shoe at her.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòCardi told Asia, ‚ÄúJust admit it, you didn‚Äôt like me because I was a stripper,‚Äù‚Ä¶which is truth, because Asia was denying it. She used to tell me, ‚ÄúYou are around a stripper, you doing this,‚Äù and I tried to explain to her that this was Cardi‚Äôs past ‚Äî that she‚Äôs not a stripper anymore; that we‚Äôre working on music.‚Äô Cardi is notorious for starting beef with fellow stars, like the time she got into a physical fight with Yorma, and has seemingly started another feud with her fellow rapper Nicki Minaj. Sorry, this video isn't available any more. The pair appear to be embroiled in a spat following the incident (Picture: Getty) In video footage that emerged today, the new mum can be seen running towards what appears to be Nicki‚Äôs entourage. A voice can be heard from the crowd of a woman shouting: ‚ÄòAre you crazy?‚Äô as Cardi reemerges from the group, falling into security who are trying to defuse the situation. Nicki isn‚Äôt seen on the video and is yet to make a comment about the incident. However, according to TMZ Cardi took off her shoe and threw it at the singer before leaving the NYFW party with a pretty substantial black eye.

What company described its products as Finger Lickin' Good? What is the answer?","completion":"The company that described its products as \\"Finger Lickin' Good\\" is KFC, which stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken. KFC is an American-based, fast-food restaurant chain that was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders in 1930 in North Corbin, Kentucky. The company is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, which also owns other popular fast-food chains, such as Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. KFC's famous tagline, \\"Finger Lickin' Good,\\" was introduced in the late 1950s and was predominantly used to market their signature product, fried chicken. The phrase intends to convey the deliciousness and irresistibility of KFC's chicken, implying that customers will be compelled to lick their fingers to savor every last bit of flavor. KFC is best known for its pressure-cooked, seasoned chicken, which is typically served in buckets or individual portions. While fried chicken is the centerpiece of the KFC menu, the company has expanded its offerings over the years to include other popular items such as chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads, and side dishes such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and biscuits. In addition, KFC has introduced different variations of their fried chicken recipe, like grilled and extra crispy, to cater to different customer preferences. As of now, KFC has a presence in over 140 countries worldwide, making it one of the largest fast-food chains across the globe. It continues to innovate and expand its menu offerings, while also focusing on maintaining customer loyalty through a combination of food quality, taste, and value. In August 2020, however, KFC decided to temporarily suspend the use of the \\"Finger Lickin' Good\\" slogan in their advertising due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as the company deemed it inappropriate given the heightened emphasis on hand hygiene and avoiding potential health risks. Nevertheless, KFC's \\"Finger Lickin' Good\\" tagline remains one of the most iconic and well-recognized slogans in the fast-food industry's history."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: I can use this background: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] Now, I have a new situation: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area, because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year. Answer this question please: Which month of the year was drier, August 2018 or August 2019? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it suggests that 2018 was a wet year for the Four Corners area due to a stronger subtropical ridge, while 2019 was a dry year as the subtropical ridge lacked strength. Although specific monthly data is not mentioned, we can infer that the monsoon conditions were influenced by the strength of the subtropical ridge in each respective year. In 2018, the subtropical ridge was stronger than normal, causing wetter monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest. Since the monsoon season typically spans from July to September, we can assume that August 2018 was a wet month in the Four Corners area due to the stronger subtropical ridge promoting more monsoon moisture and thunderstorms. In contrast, in 2019, the subtropical ridge lacked strength, leading to a drier year in the Four Corners area. Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that August 2019 was a drier month compared to its counterpart in 2018, due to the weaker subtropical ridge suppressing monsoon moisture and thunderstorms. Therefore, based on the given background, August 2019 was likely the drier month compared to August 2018 due to the weaker subtropical ridge that caused a break in the monsoon regime and drier conditions in the Four Corners area."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: For as long as humans have lived on the earth, they have made use of various forms of communication. Generally, this expression of thoughts and feelings has been in the form of oral speech. When there is a spoken language problem, communication can be carried out through sign language, in which gestures stand for letters, words, and ideas. Tourists and people unable to hear or speak have often had to turn to this form of expression. When gestures describe words or ideas, they can often be used internationally. When used for spelling words however, where each gesture stands for a single letter, people must share the same written language. Body language sends ideas or thoughts by certain actions, either meaningfully or not. A wink can be a way of showing that the person is only joking. A nod means agreement, while shaking the head indicates disagreement. Other forms of language can be found in Braille (a reading system of raised dots read with the fingertips used by the blind), signal flags, Morse code, and smoke signals. Road maps and picture signs also guide and warn people. While language is the most common form of communication, other systems and techniques also express human thoughts and feelings.

Question: - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the aluminum recycling process would typically be the transformation of the rolled aluminum into finished products. After the ingots have been sent to mills and rolled out, they would then follow a series of steps, as detailed below: 1. Slitting and cutting: The rolled aluminum is slit or cut into various shapes and sizes, depending on the type of end product that needs to be manufactured. These shapes could range from thin sheets to larger plates, strips, or foils that serve as the base form for diverse products. 2. Additional processing: Depending on the desired end product, the aluminum may undergo further processing steps, such as embossing, perforating, laminating, or coating. These processes enhance the appearance, functionality, or durability of the material to meet specific consumer or industrial demands. 3. Fabrication: The processed aluminum sheets, plates, foils, or strips are then fabricated into finished products using a variety of techniques. These fabrication methods may include stamping, bending, extrusion, forging, or welding. Some examples of end products created from recycled aluminum are cans, automotive components, window frames, and electronic parts. 4. Quality control: Before the finished products are packaged and shipped to customers, they undergo strict quality control procedures that ensure their conformity to industry standards and specifications. This may involve visual inspections, physical tests, or chemical analyses, depending on the type of product being manufactured. 5. Packaging and distribution: Once the finished products have passed the quality control checks, they are packaged using appropriate materials and methods, ensuring their safety and maintaining their quality during transportation. The packaged products are then shipped to distributors, retailers, or directly to customers. 6. End-of-life recycling: When the end users no longer have a use for the aluminum-based products, they can either return them to recycling facilities or dispose of them responsibly, contributing to a closed-loop recycling system. This loop ensures that the aluminum can be recycled endlessly, reducing waste, conserving resources, and minimizing the environmental impact. In summary, the last step of the aluminum recycling process is the transformation of the rolled aluminum into a multitude of finished products, which are then subjected to quality control checks and sent out to their intended destinations. This comprehensive process ultimately supports the sustainable reuse of aluminum and enables the continued recycling of this versatile material."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I remember back in the late 1970‚Äôs when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right.

He asked me the actual address after which he ‚Äòkindly‚Äô informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously.

Write a title for this article: Donald Trump's controversial bid to lead Republicans into the next presidential election appears to highlight differences between American and Canadian politics, but a new survey suggests they may not be so different after all. The poll by the Angus Reid Institute (ARI) found that 33 per cent of Canadians strongly or moderately agree with Trump's call for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\\" While two-thirds of Canadians disagreed (and 49 per cent strongly so), that still leaves a large proportion of Canadians looking kindly on a plan that has been widely condemned both in Canada and the U.S. And it puts Canadians on almost the same level with Americans. A Washington Post-ABC poll conducted at the same time as the ARI survey found that 36 per cent of Americans supported Trump's ban, with 60 per cent thinking it \\"the wrong thing to do.\\" At this stage of the presidential primaries, Trump is only trying to win over Republican voters. The Post-ABC poll suggests his plan is a winner, with 59 per cent of Republicans supporting it and 38 per cent thinking it the wrong thing to do. However, despite interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose recently telling the Canadian Press that \\"I think [Trump's] off the spectrum, frankly ‚Ä¶ that's not a voice that we welcome in our party,\\" the ARI poll indicates that a majority of Canadians who voted for the Conservatives in October think Trump is onto something. In total, 55 per cent of Canadian Conservative voters strongly or moderately agreed with Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Canadians who voted for the Liberals and New Democrats were strongly opposed, however ‚Äî 77 per cent of New Democrats and 82 per cent of Liberals disagreed with the ban, with about two-thirds strongly disagreeing with it. In a town hall held by Maclean's magazine this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rejected Trump's \\"hateful\\" rhetoric. In the U.S., 82 per cent of Democrats in the Post-ABC poll said it was the wrong thing to do. Note that the ARI poll was conducted using the firm's online panel, whereas the Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone with live interviewers. This difference in methodology has the potential to influence responses, and so some caution should be exercised when comparing the two polls. Trudeau on Donald Trump's views on Muslims2:00 The ARI poll showed some regional and demographic differences on the issue, with support for Trump's Muslim ban being highest on the Prairies. There was also a link to education: less educated Canadians looked more favourably on the ban than more educated Canadians. And despite the controversies over reasonable accommodations in Quebec, the ARI poll showed that Quebeckers were less likely than other Canadians to support Trump's ban. When presented with two options, one suggesting that Trump's rhetoric is \\"bad for society, it encourages fear and hatred\\" and the other that it is \\"good for society, it gets at 'politically incorrect' issues that should be talked about,\\" 63 per cent of Canadians thought it was bad for society (including 66 per cent of Quebeckers). The remaining 37 per cent thought it was good for society. Perhaps Canadian and American politics aren't so different after all. The poll by the Angus Reid Institute was conducted between Dec. 10 and 13, 2015, interviewing 1,530 Canadians via the Internet. As the poll was conducted online, a margin of error does not apply. The poll by the Washington Post-ABC was conducted between Dec. 10 and 13, 2015, interviewing 1,002 Americans via the telephone.

What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. According to the above context, answer the following question. What did the shoe inserts claim they would do? The answer is:","completion":"The shoe inserts claimed that they would help the wearer lose weight, causing the pounds to melt away, when combined with a 1200-calorie-per-day diet.

Question: I can use this background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Now, I have a new situation: Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention. Answer this question please: Which person's parents are less likely to wear glasses? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, it is more likely that Rick's parents are less likely to wear glasses in comparison to John's parents. As mentioned, there is evidence that myopia (nearsightedness) is inherited and if one or both of a person's parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that the person will need them too. In this situation, John is nearsighted and needs to wear glasses, which implies that he might have inherited this trait from one or both of his parents, making it more probable that John's parents need glasses. On the other hand, Rick does not require glasses and expresses his satisfaction about not needing to wear them. This suggests that Rick's genetic predisposition for needing glasses might be lower compared to John's, and therefore, his parents are less likely to wear glasses in comparison to John's parents. However, it is vital to mention that needing glasses is not solely determined by genetics. Environmental factors, visual stress, and health conditions can contribute to a person developing vision problems. But based on the information provided, it is more probable that Rick's parents are less likely to wear glasses compared to John's parents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The first anniversary of the Egyptian revolution is today. Egyptian society and the forces in Egypt are in a state of anticipation. World media has its cameras and correspondents in Cairo and major cities around the country. But many Egyptians wonder if the revolution amounted to nothing more than a military coup. It has been a year since the eruption of the first Egyptian revolution that stunned the world and ended 30 years of authoritarian, oppressive and corrupt rule by Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's last pharaoh. Mubarak ended up in jail along with his sons and his regime's major figures, with stories of their unimaginable corruption, brutality and looting surfacing ever since. But since then, most Egyptians have become angry and frustrated with the performance of the Military Council -- comprising more than a dozen elderly generals -- that has taken control. Egyptians, political forces and revolutionaries accuse the Military Council of being accomplices with the remnants of the Mubarak regime and of refusing to enact real reform, to the point of actually waging a counter-revolution. Egyptians have been enraged by the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations that followed the revolution, and in the arrests, humiliations and even killings of protesters. The Military Council is still controlling the state media and the political scene. Western governments and human rights organizations are expressing their dismay, with Human Rights Watch reporting killings and brutal attacks, some of them sexual, on protesters. The council is the Old Guard, desperately trying to preserve the military's long-standing privileges and special status. The military has been running Egypt since 1952 -- with rulers such as Gen. Mohammed Naguib, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Mubarak and Marshal Tantawy coming from its ranks. The military has dominated Egypt's modern political scene, with members serving as presidents, prime ministers, Cabinet ministers, governors, party elites, heads of the security services, ambassadors, heads of many companies, and even ministers of culture and the media -- in a true Orwellian fashion. The military institution in Egypt consumes more than 25% of the government expenditure and owns about 30% of the national economy. The United States has given Egypt a hefty military aid package of billions of dollars for nearly three decades. Egyptians respect their armed forces, but are desperate for a civil state where human rights, rights of minorities, and accountability and transparency are guaranteed. They do not want another pharaoh-like president coming from that institution. Egyptians have been asked to commemorate the special occasion of the revolution's first anniversary by taking to the streets Wednesday, wearing black in mourning of the deaths of hundreds of the revolution's martyrs. But some political forces refuse to call it a celebration -- they say the revolution is not finished and their demands have not been met. Demonstrators have already started to pour into Tahrir Square. Activists are calling for the immediate transition of power from the Military Council to a civilian council, or even an interim caretaker. Now, after bringing down the Mubarak regime and his notorious State Security apparatus, Egyptians have broken the fear barrier and believe there is no turning back. Will they stun the world again, with Egyptian Revolution, Part II? Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

On the other hand, the hypothesis states that Napoleon successfully conquered both Poland and Russia. Step 4: Draw a conclusion. Based on the comparison, it seems that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is unlikely to be true as well.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Response To Nuclear Kitty Litter Is Moving Fast Inaction following the first radioactive leak at the world‚Äôs only deep geologic nuclear waste repository was threatening to stamp the most successful government program in history with an undeserved scarlet letter. Fortunately, the State of New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Energy have moved fast, realizing that time is not our friend in this situation. Recall that the Waste Isolation Pilot Project, the only operating geologic nuclear waste repository, had its first minor accident on Valentine‚Äôs Day after 15 years of perfect operations (NMED). It was a small release of radiation that did not, and will not, harm anyone or have any environmental consequence. Those of us studying this issue figured since it happened at WIPP, it must be a WIPP problem, so we thought about what could go wrong with the rock or with the way WIPP operates. But WIPP was not the problem at all. The problem was what came to WIPP (Kitty Litter). Some drums slowly got hot, and one blew its top, because of what was in them. Photo of WIPP waste containers in Panel 7 disposal Room 7, after the Valentine‚Äôs Day radioactive release, shows magnesium oxide scattered over the drums and standard waste boxes that contain the transuranic waste. A breached drum shows heat discoloration and an open lid from the force of the rupture. MgO is a granular material placed in thin supersacks on top of the waste that are supposed to break as the ceiling creeps in after panel closure, letting the MgO fall around the waste to act as a sorbent to any water and CO2 in the room over time, as well as to buffer the pH to optimal levels. It also forms a strong sorrel cement when if contacted with brine, and sorbs plutonium really well. These sacks absorbed and dissipated a significant amount of energy during the event. Source: DOE It‚Äôs natural that everyone was being very cautious, but we took three months to get back to the suspect drums and so focused on the wrong things like the rock is falling. The initial investigation reports were highly critical of the WIPP facility‚Äôs operations and management, yet did not catch the actual cause of this event and instead focused on issues that had little significance to the accident. In fact, the radiation release during this event was almost completely contained by the WIPP safety systems. Only 1.3 millicuries were released into the environment, especially americium (Am), an amount of Am many times less than the Am in all the smoke detectors of any small town in America. At the same time, digging into documents, assay sheets and records (every container and drum is barcoded and tracked) told us what was in those drums and why they generated heat and pressure in a slow burn. These reactions aren‚Äôt affected by shocking, shaking, friction or any other things you think of with a bomb, because these are not like bombs. They‚Äôre like slow-burning charcoal briquettes. The reactions just require time. It is understandable that DOE was being careful (WIPP Recovery), not wanting to speculate and muddy the waters, and maybe having to retract something later. It is their job to be very certain and this event was nothing if not bizarre. The possible legal issues alone would scare me catatonic. Also, the types of chemical analyses needed, the difficulty in reconstructing the event, the difficulty of getting into the underground ‚Äì these are not actions one rushes into. But DOE‚Äôs reticence was being seen as obfuscation and was getting the State and the public frustrated. Community support is wavering. State support is wavering. If not checked, this process will not end well for DOE, and WIPP might never reopen. So we can‚Äôt let this go along on its own formal timescale. We need to take hold of it and take action. If we do not move quickly, the Carlsbad community, and the entire State of New Mexico, will be unfairly punished for 30 years of support of a mission critical to the United States ‚Äì that of cleaning up the legacy of the Cold War. No one else stepped up, and no one else will. We need to reward that support by not wasting time and letting the site sink into oblivion because America has become afraid of taking action. Fortunately, the New Mexico Environment Department realizes this and issued two Administrative Orders to DOE to address, as fast as possible, the two most pressing issues ‚Äì the drums still hanging around someplace not WIPP, and sealing off the rooms and panels down in WIPP that have some of these drums (NMED LANL Order; NMED WIPP Order). Secure drum overpacks provided by LANL for explosion-containment of suspect unstable drums not yet in WIPP until final disposition is determined. Source: DOE Using what‚Äôs known as Acceptable Knowledge documents that detail the contents of each drum and their treatment histories (such as CCP-AK-LANL-006 and other DOE and contractor documents), we can reconstruct the general story as follows. Beginning over 30 years ago, activities involving separating americium (Am) from old weapons materials generated a moderate amount of transuranic waste contaminated with americium (Am), plutonium, uranium and minor amounts of other radionuclides, and containing various metal-nitrate salts (strong oxidizers), such as (Mg,Ca)(NO3)2 with minor amounts of Fe, Na and K. When dewatered, these hot evaporator bottoms were poured onto a tray, vacuum dried, flashed crystallized, rinsed with cold water and put in bags, where they sat for 30 years. Come time for disposal a few years ago, these wastes still had some nitric acid liquid. Department of Transportation regulations require no free liquid (<1%) during transport, so these wastes were stabilized with neutralizers and sorbents like sodium carbonate, triethanolamine and polyacrylate as they were put into drums for packaging and shipment. It was recommended sometime later that inorganic kitty litter made from silicate minerals be added as a sorbent (widely used in radiochemistry as well as the home litter box), but also to dissipate heat and generally mitigate auto-oxidation reactions of the kind we think occurred in these drums in WIPP. Anhydrous citric acid (a reducer) was used to bring the pH down if over-adjusted. For reasons perhaps related to good intentions, or merely related to dust generation, the inorganic kitty litter was replaced by organic wheat-based litter early on in the process. There were a few other components of not much import in the drums, but additional organic components just added more fuel. Some decisions regarding these additives are vague and not attributable to a real chemist. Citric acid should never be used with metal-nitrate salts, because of the rapid evolution of heat. Similarly for acrylates. The use of organic additives for whatever purpose adds fuel to this mixture. And organic litters have the wrong properties for their intended function but being organic, they too add to the amount of fuel that could burn. I do think the correct litter alone would have prevented these reactions. When real chemists did look at this mixture, they were appalled. These drums were assigned as a specific waste stream and were able to be tracked through a barcode system. The suspect drums that breached in WIPP were from waste stream LA-MIN02-V.001 in which all drums were mixed with the incorrect litter. 368 of these drums were identified as being disposed of in WIPP: 313 in Panel 6, and 55 in Panel 7 Room 7. Investigators have looked at several rows of waste on either side of the breached drum looking for evidence of damage or any breaches in other waste containers, but found nothing. So we know where they are, we know where the contamination is, and we know how to clean this up. Two actions need to be taken immediately, and are the subject of the two NMED Administrative Orders issued last week. First, there are more drums like these out there, not having been shipped to WIPP yet. They need to be rounded up, put under safe conditions, treated or repackaged. This has nothing to do with WIPP. As of today, it appears that LANL has secured all these drums in special explosion-proof containers in isolated areas with fire-suppression capabilities, and is monitoring them continuously (see photo of overpack). This was done quite quickly once the waste stream was identified. Their final disposition is being planned. Second, the drums already in WIPP, in Panel 6 and Panel 7 (Room 7) need to be sealed off with bulkheads like we do all the time, and shut off from the ventilation system. Metal bulkheads can handle these energetic events easily, and as the salt creeps in, they will be contained as only 2,000 feet of massive molecularly-tight salt can do. Panel 6 is full and complete, so putting up two bulkheads is the first logical step. Room 7 in Panel 7 can be finished with crushed salt and also two bulkheads. Room 6 Panel 7 is contaminated and could be sacrificed by just filling with crushed salt and bulkheaded. (see figures of different types of room seals). Different types of room and panel seals in the WIPP underground. Top left: brattice cloth, a temporary block when the room or panel is full while waiting for more secure seal, not meant to be air tight but does stop most air flow to waste. Bottom left: metal bulkheads which are fairly airtight and secure, especially two emplaced with airspace between, sufficient to contain any more kitty litter drum events and very quick and easy to install (days). Upper right: 12-foot explosion-proof block wall, a very secure seal but time-consuming to install (months) and requires many workers to spend a lot of time near the waste face. Bottom right: Run-of-mine crushed salt emplaced along the panel entry drift, very secure, relatively easy to emplace and will self-seal as the whole-rock salt creeps in over years to become molecularly tight. Source: DOE The second NMED Administrative Order calls for DOE to submit a plan by the end of next week to accomplish sealing of these rooms. The other rooms in Panel 7 and the exhaust paths and shaft are not very contaminated and can be deconned without great cost or time. Plans for these are forthcoming as well. WIPP operations could then resume in less than a year without wasting billions of dollars and without completely derailing nuclear clean-up activities across the country. This was not a WIPP problem, but WIPP will fix it. Greater oversight of the waste packaging, and implementing the recommendations of the accident reports that pointed out various operational deficiencies, won‚Äôt take long and can be executed quickly without great cost. If we don‚Äôt move quickly, it will cost billions and could derail the only successful nuclear waste disposal program in the world. Also, this response is a test to see if America can handle the environmental issues surrounding nuclear better than other countries who shall remain nameless. If WIPP can‚Äôt resume operations, we will be forced to stop putting our nation‚Äôs nuclear waste in a safe place and it will either stay right where it is, or go to a second-rate place. This would bode ill for other nuclear-related issues such as our high-level defense waste or our nuclear waste confidence proceedings needed for NRC to issue new reactor licenses. The need for this repository has not changed. The fact that the salt is the best rock type has not changed. The excellent 15-year operational and safety record of WIPP prior to this event has not changed. This event did not result from a flaw of WIPP itself, but from operations elsewhere from WIPP. If WIPP resumes in short order, we will be able to deal with the waste backlog across the country in a year or two. WIPP was ahead of schedule and under budget before this event. The recovery costs won‚Äôt be very large if we move fast. Most importantly, however, with WIPP back online we will have a chance of actually disposing of our legacy nuclear weapons waste within a hundred years from when they began being produced in the first place.","completion":"The Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP), the world's only deep geological nuclear waste repository, encountered its first minor radioactive leak in 2014 after 15 years of perfect operations. Instead of focusing on the actual cause of the event, initial investigation reports were critical of WIPP's facility management. Since then, the New Mexico Environment Department, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department of Energy have acted swiftly to address the two most pressing issues: the drums still around WIPP and the drums in WIPP. If WIPP doesn't resume operations, billions could be wasted and the U.S.'s only successful nuclear waste disposal program could be derailed, causing nuclear waste to remain in unsafe locations or be moved to second-rate places. If WIPP resumes in a timely manner, the waste backlog across the U.S. can be dealt with in a year or two, and the country will have a chance to dispose of its legacy nuclear weapons waste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pence will pay a three day visit to Israel. (AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov) (Associated Press) AMMAN, Jordan (AP) ‚Äî Jordan's king appealed Sunday to Vice President Mike Pence to \\"rebuild trust and confidence\\" in the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, following fallout from the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Pence tried to reassure the monarch that the U.S. was committed to restarting peace efforts and to a two-state solution, if both sides agree. Such a caveat deviates from long-standing U.S. support for that approach as the only possible outcome of any peace deal. Trump's announcement on Jerusalem last month infuriated the Palestinians, who seek the Israeli-annexed eastern sector of the city as a future capital. They accused the U.S. of siding with Israel and said Washington can no longer serve as a mediator. Jerusalem is the emotional centerpiece of the long-running conflict, and Trump's policy shift set off protests and condemnation across Arab and Muslim countries. It posed a dilemma for Abdullah, a staunch U.S. ally who derives his political legitimacy in large part from the Hashemite dynasty's role as guardian of a key Muslim site in Jerusalem. Any perceived threat to Muslim claims in the city is seen as a challenge to Jordan, where a large segment of the population is of Palestinian origin. Pence told the king that the U.S. has committed \\"to continue to respect Jordan's role as the custodian of holy sites, that we take no position on boundaries and final status.\\" It was a message Pence relayed Saturday in talks with Egypt's president. Later, after meeting U.S. troops near the Syrian border, Pence said he and Abdullah had \\"a very frank discussion.\\" \\"Look, friends occasionally have disagreements and we agreed to disagree on the decision by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But what we agreed on was the need for all parties to come back to the table,\\" Pence said. \\"The Palestinian Authority has been absent from direct negotiations since 2014. And I hope I impressed upon King Abdullah our earnest desire to restart the peace process,\\" Pence said. Abdullah expressed concerns about the regional fallout from the Jerusalem decision. \\"Today we have a major challenge to overcome, especially with some of the rising frustrations,\\" he said. He described the Pence visit as a mission \\"to rebuild trust and confidence\\" in getting to a two-state solution, in which a state of Palestine would be established in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967. Another cause of concern for Jordan is the Trump administration's decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Jordan vehemently opposes such a move if taken ahead of an Israeli-Palestinian partition deal. Israel views Jerusalem as its unified capital. An international consensus has long held that the city's final status should be decided through negotiations, which was also U.S. policy going back decades. Palestinians view Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as a blatantly one-sided move. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not meet with Trump administration officials and called off a meeting with Pence that had been scheduled for mid-December. In a new expression of that snub, Abbas overlapped with Pence in Jordan from Saturday evening to midday Sunday, when the Palestinian leader flew to Brussels for a meeting with European Union foreign ministers Monday. There, Abbas is expected to urge EU member states to recognize a state of Palestine in the pre-1967 lines, and to step up involvement in mediation. Nabil Abu Rdeneh, an Abbas adviser, reiterated that \\"the U.S. is no longer acceptable as a mediator.\\" Pence was scheduled to hold meetings on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, deliver an address to the Knesset and visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Netanyahu called Pence \\"a great friend of Israel\\" and said there was \\"no alternative for American leadership\\" in the peace process. \\"Whoever is not ready to talk with the Americans about peace ‚Äî does not want peace,\\" he said at a meeting of ambassadors in Jerusalem. Palestinians in the West Bank protested Pence's arrival by burning posters with his image on them. ___ Associated Press writer Karin Laub contributed to this report. ||||| AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan‚Äôs King Abdullah told U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday he looked to Washington to rebuild ‚Äútrust and confidence‚Äù in moving toward a two-state solution in Israel after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the country‚Äôs capital. With Pence sitting across from him in the royal palace, King Abdullah said Jordan viewed the Israel-Palestinian conflict as a ‚Äúpotential major source of instability‚Äù. He said he had raised his concerns for some time that such a decision on Jerusalem ‚Äúdoes not come as a result of a comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict‚Äù. He also reiterated that East Jerusalem should be the capital of a future Palestinian state. ‚ÄúWe hope that the U.S. will reach out and find the right way to move forward in these challenging circumstances,‚Äù the king said. At the end of the visit, Pence in remarks to the press said he ‚Äúagreed to disagree‚Äù with King Abdullah on the impact of Trump‚Äôs move. Pence said in Egypt on Saturday and again in Jordan that the United States would support a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians if they both agreed to it. Trump‚Äôs endorsement in December of Israel‚Äôs claim to Jerusalem as its capital drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world. It also broke with decades of U.S. policy that the city‚Äôs status must be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the Arab-Israeli war in 1967. Pence told the king that Washington was committed to preserving the status quo of holy sites in Jerusalem. King Abdullah‚Äôs Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in the city, making Amman particularly sensitive to any changes of status there. ‚ÄúFor us, Jerusalem is key to Muslims and Christians, as it is to Jews. It is key to peace in the region and key to enabling Muslims to effectively fight some of our root causes of radicalization,‚Äù he said. Jordanian officials fear Trump‚Äôs move has wrecked chances of a resumption of Arab-Israeli peace talks, which King Abdullah had sought to revive. Slideshow (6 Images) They also worry the move could trigger violence in the Palestinian territories which could spill over into Jordan, where many people are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after Israel was created in 1948. ‚ÄúWe take no position on boundaries and final status. Those are subject to negotiation,‚Äù Pence said. After the meeting, Pence flew to a military facility near the Syrian border to meet with U.S. troops. He will finish his three-nation Middle East trip in Israel. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visited Jordan in January 2018, a month after the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision which infuriated Palestinians. Pence‚Äôs visit aimed to rebuild trust in the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which had been undermined following the Trump administration's controversial Jerusalem decision. According to reports, Pence reassured King Abdullah of Jordan that the U.S. was committed to restarting peace efforts and supporting a two-state solution, but only if both parties agree. This represented a significant shift from the long-standing U.S. position of unequivocally supporting the two-state solution as the only outcome to the conflict. The Jerusalem decision had significant implications not just for Palestinians, but also for Jordan. Jerusalem is considered an emotional centerpiece of the long-standing conflict, stirring protests and condemnation across Arab and Muslim countries. King Abdullah, a staunch U.S. ally, derives his political legitimacy partly from the Hashemite dynasty's role as the guardian of a key Muslim site in Jerusalem. Therefore, any perceived threat towards Muslim claims in Jerusalem is seen as a challenge to Jordan, which is home to a large Palestinian-origin population. Other key concerns for Jordan included Trump administration's plan to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that the Kingdom opposed if taken ahead of an Israeli-Palestinian partition deal. This decision faced international opposition, as it broke with the consensus that the city's final status should be decided through negotiations. Pence‚Äôs visit was marked by robust discussions with King Abdullah, including a \\"very frank discussion\\" regarding their disagreements over U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Despite their differences, both leaders agreed on the importance of resuming peace talks. Pence expressed hope that his visit will reignite the peace process, demonstrating the U.S.'s commitment to respect Jordan's role as the custodian of holy sites and remaining neutral on the issues of boundaries and final status. The Jerusalem decision also led to severe backlash from Palestinian authorities. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas refused to meet Trump administration officials, canceled a scheduled meeting with Pence, and publicly stated that the U.S. can no longer serve as a mediator. In response to these developments, Abbas sought to increase European Union involvement in mediation efforts and is urging EU member states to recognize Palestine as a state based on the pre-1967 lines. Throughout his trip, Pence, who referred to the U.S. as Israel's greatest friend, reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to peace in the region. He maintained the view that any refusal to engage with America over peace signifies an unwillingness towards peace. Pence‚Äôs tour concluded with visits to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Overall, Pence's visit to Jordan in 2018 underlined the complexity of U.S. relationships in the region following the controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Although intended to rebuild trust, it showcased deep-seated disagreement and concern from key regional actors such as Jordan and the Palestinians about the U.S.'s role in peace negotiations and the future of the two-state solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do jellyfish change color?","completion":"The following two questions, \\"Can jellyfish change color?\\" and \\"Do jellyfish change color?\\" are related in terms of their subject matter, but they have subtle differences in their meanings and implications. Analyzing these questions will help to highlight their unique properties and the answers they seek. 1. Can jellyfish change color? This question asks if jellyfish possess the ability or capacity to change color. It focuses on determining whether or not the innate traits or characteristics of jellyfish allow them to alter their colors. The answer to this question is yes, some species of jellyfish are capable of changing color. For example, certain species such as the comb jellies (Ctenophores) exhibit bioluminescence, which allows them to produce and emit light through a chemical reaction within their bodies. This light production can create various colors, and changes in these colors can be observed when the jellyfish are exposed to different types of environmental stimuli. Bioluminescence is often used by these marine creatures for various purposes, such as attracting prey, communication, or as a form of protection against predators. Another example of color change in jellyfish is the freshwater jellyfish (Craspedacusta sowerbyi), which can adapt its color depending on its surroundings. This color change can help the jellyfish blend in with its environment and avoid predation. 2. Do jellyfish change color? This question, in comparison, seeks to understand if jellyfish actively and commonly change color in their natural habitat. It aims to know whether the color-changing behavior is a regular occurrence in the jellyfish's life. The answer to this question is that it depends on the specific species of jellyfish since not all jellyfish exhibit color changes. In the case of the previously mentioned comb jellies and freshwater jellyfish, color changes can indeed occur regularly as part of their natural behavior. However, there are many other species of jellyfish that do not display any color-changing abilities. For example, the popular moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) does not actively change color but can appear differently depending on light conditions or the presence of their prey, such as colored plankton or crustaceans, inside their translucent bodies. In conclusion, the questions \\"Can jellyfish change color?\\" and \\"Do jellyfish change color?\\" are not precisely the same, though they may appear similar at first glance. The first question delves into the potential abilities of jellyfish, while the second question investigates the actual occurrence of color changes in these creatures. It is essential to understand these differences to be more accurate in the information we seek regarding jellyfish and their fascinating color-changing abilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn‚Äôt give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4‚Äì5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation‚ÄîI hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it‚Äôs an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: What did Meg do after her anger simmered?

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty‚Äôs death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his ‚Äúranch‚Äù on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms‚ÄîGalleries 105 to 108‚Äîshare this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty‚Äôs personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch‚Äîonce part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant‚Äîjust after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (‚ÄúTeddy‚Äù) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\"). Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"All of them\\" correctly answer the question \\"Did the four bombers know the masterminds behind it?\\"?","completion":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, the answer to the question \\"Did the four bombers know the masterminds behind it?\\" would ostensibly be \\"Yes,\\" as at least some connection can be drawn between each individual mentioned and the operational masterminds, namely Osama Bin Laden, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), and Mohammed Atef. However, the text does not explicitly mention that each of the four bombers (Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni) knew the three masterminds directly. It is stated that Bin Laden personally selected the four individuals to serve as suicide operatives, implying a direct connection between Bin Laden and the selected operatives. Furthermore, KSM was told by Bin Laden that Mihdhar and Hazmi were selected because they already had U.S. visas, which suggests that they were at least aware of the key person behind the operation, even if KSM himself had not met them. As for Khallad, his father was known to have been acquainted with Bin Laden. However, the links between the bombers and the masterminds are not made wholly clear for each case, particularly Abu Bara al Yemeni, whose relationship with the masterminds is not explicitly described in the passage, and the extent to which each of the selected individuals knew about the others involved in the planning stages of the operation is not specified. In conclusion, while it can be inferred that the bombers were generally aware of the masterminds behind the operation, to state that \\"all of them\\" inextricably knew the masterminds in a direct and personal sense may be inaccurate given the ambiguity of the information provided. We can surmise that the bombers likely knew of or were acquainted with the masterminds, but the precise degree of mutual knowledge or personal familiarity cannot be conclusively determined from the passage.

To solve for p, we must isolate the variable p on one side of the equation.

If you want the dye to appear like it does on the packaging, you need to start with a white base. If you prefer a muted shade, however, you could start with gray linen instead. You can try dyeing a cotton-linen or rayon-linen blend, but be aware that the results may not be consistent or even. If you are working with yarn, wind the yarn around your hand and elbow to create a large hank. Loosely tie pieces of string around the hank to secure it. Use a funnel to fill a large jug with 1 cup (140 g) of soda ash. Add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water that is around 105 ¬∞F (41 ¬∞C). Close the jug and shake it to dissolve the soda ash. Open the jug and set it aside so that the water can cool. Use pure soda ash (sodium carbonate), not baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). You can find it online and in well-stocked craft stores. If you have hard water in your town or city, add some water softener. This will prevent the minerals from affecting the dye. Place your fabric or yarn into a plastic tub. Fill it with enough of the soda ash solution to completely cover the linen. Let the linen soak for at least 20 minutes. Save the rest of the soda ash for later. The soda ash solution can still be hot for this step. Each brand will be a little different, but in most cases, you will have to mix 2 teaspoons of fabric reactive dye powder with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Mix the dye with a little bit of warm water to form a paste first, then add the rest of the water. Wear safety googles and rubber of plastic gloves to protect your eyes and skin. Wear a dusk mask approved for fine particles for this step. Powdered fabric reactive dye is dangerous to breathe in. Use less dye for a lighter shade and more dye for a darker shade. You don't have to use an applicator bottle if you won't want to, but many people find it easier to use than just pouring the dye from the container your prepared it in. How much more dye you prepare depends on how much linen you are dyeing; refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more advice. Take the linen out of the soda ash bath, and squeeze out the excess solution. Set the linen down onto a plastic tray or bag, then squirt the dye onto it. You can create an all-over solid color or a splotchy color. You can even use multiple colors to create a tie dye effect. Keep color mixing in mind. If you put 2 contrasting colors next to each other, they will form brown then they touch. Squeeze the linen after you apply the dye, then apply more dye if needed. If you dyed your linen multiple colors, be careful not to bundle it up. Arrange the linen so that no 2 colors touch or smoosh together. Zip or tie the bag shut, and leave it in a warm place for 12 to 24 hours. The place should be at least 65 ¬∞F (18 ¬∞C). The longer you leave the linen in the bag, the brighter and more vibrant the colors will turn out. Don't worry, fiber reactive dyes are non-toxic, so they won't harm the environment or waterways. The soda ash can also unblock clogs in your sink! Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. It would be a good idea to rinse the linen afterwards with Synthrapol, which helps set the dye into the linen better. You need to use Synthrapol with hot water; follow the instructions on the bottle. Make sure that no soda ash remains inn the linen before you start. Squeeze the linen with your hands until you get most of the water out. Spread it out on an old towel in a well-ventilated area away from sunlight. Allow it to air dry completely before using the fabric or yarn. Once the yarn is dry, snip the strings holding the skein together, then roll the skein into a ball. Summary:","completion":"Dyeing linen is a fun and creative process. First, soak the linen in a soda ash solution for at least 20 minutes. Then, mix the fabric reactive dye powder with water to create the dye. After soaking, squeeze out the excess solution from the linen, and apply the dye onto it. You can use different colors and patterns. Put the dyed linen in a plastic bag and let it sit for 12 to 24 hours in a warm place to set the color. After that, rinse the linen until the water runs clear. Finally, let it air dry on an old towel away from sunlight. Once it's dry, your colorful linen is ready to use!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Alex Seitz-Wald PHILADELPHIA ‚Äî Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been ousted as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee on the eve of the party's convention. It's an abrupt end to a chairmanship marked by controversy, which came to a head this weekend following revelations from leaked internal emails. \\"Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention,\\" Wasserman Schultz said in a lengthy statement Sunday announcing her resignation, referring to her desire to unify the party. Wasserman Schultz said she plans to step down at the end of the convention, though some Democrats are already saying she may not last that long. \\"As Party Chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans,\\" Wasserman Schultz added. Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge has been selected to serve as chair of the Democratic National Convention, which kicks off Monday. Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Donna Brazile will serve as Interim Chair through the election, a DNC spokesperson said on Twitter. As recently as Friday, there was no sign of trouble and Wasserman Schultz was set to lead the convention, according to sources. Wasserman Schultz spoke at two Hillary Clinton rallies in Florida Friday and Saturday, including the one where presumptive vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine appeared publicly for the first time. But opposition to Wasserman Schultz, both public and private, had been gaining steam following the publication late last week of leaked emails which seemed to show a plot by DNC officials to damage Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. The revelations created doubts from various sectors of the party about how Wasserman Schultz could oversee a convention meant to showcase party unity. By late Saturday, opposition inside the party \\"spread like wildfire,\\" according to a Democratic source close to the matter. It resulted in a tense confrontation Sunday when officials told Wasserman Schultz she had to go. Wasserman Schultz had become toxic to supporters of Sanders, who accused her of rigging the Democratic presidential nominating process in favor of Clinton. Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz Richard Drew / AP In a statement, Sanders said that Wasserman Schultz had made \\"the right decision\\" but repeated his criticism of the party for what he describes as the DNC putting its thumb on the scale during the primary contest. \\"Debbie Wasserman Schultz has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party,\\" he said. \\"While she deserves thanks for her years of service, the party now needs new leadership that will open the doors of the party and welcome in working people and young people. The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race.\\" But starting even before that, many Democrats had privately lost confidence in her leadership. \\"She's essentially a pariah in every corner of the party,\\" said one veteran Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal politics. \\"This has needed to happen for a long time.\\" For instance in late May, after a news report that Democrats were considering ousting Wasserman Schultz, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called her to say he would not put out a statement defending her. Wasserman Schultz also overrode the White House and the Clinton campaign in her choice of communications director for the DNC last fall. The key role went vacant for five months as the various parties tried to find a candidate acceptable to her, with some allies criticizing the process and outcome. Even Clinton allies questioned the DNC's heavy-handed approach to dealing with the Sanders campaign during a data breach incident in December, worrying that it would undermine the credibility of a nominating process they hoped to win. Wasserman Schultz had already effectively lost control of the DNC after Clinton's campaign inserted operative Brandon Davis to run operations on a day-to-day basis. The Clinton campaign also recently sent a second staffer, Adam Parkhomenko, from its Brooklyn headquarters to serve in a senior role on the committee. But internal DNC emails posted online by Wikileaks late last week became the catalyst for her official removal. One email showed the party's finance chairman suggesting the DNC use what they assumed to be Sanders' atheism against him in Kentucky and West Virginia, religious states where it might not play well. Others showed Wasserman Schultz criticizing Sanders for not being a member of the party and saying he would never be president. The emails were apparently stolen by hackers working for the Russian government, and Clinton officials have said their posting is an attempt to sway the election for Donald Trump. The emails implicate other DNC officials, including CEO Amy Dacey, a close Wasserman Schultz ally who is well respected by other Democrats, and communications department officials. Meanwhile, Wasserman Schultz is facing a surprisingly tough congressional reelection campaign back home in Florida against a primary candidate backed by Sanders. Wasserman Schultz, who began her tenure as chair in 2011, proved herself to be a prodigious fundraiser for fellow Delegates and an effective party surrogate and attack dog. \\"I want to thank my longtime friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the Democratic National Committee over the past five years,\\" Clinton said a statement accepting the chairwoman's resignation. Wasserman Schultz served as a co-chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and Clinton said Sunday that the Floridian will serve as \\"honorary chair\\" of her campaign's 50-state program and continue to serve as a surrogate for her campaign nationally and in Florida. Her detractors inside the party had resigned themselves to Wasserman Schultz's leadership through November, comforted by the fact that she had been marginalized by Clinton aides. Even some critics in the Clinton campaign and White House thought it would be better to keep Wasserman Schultz than to risk presenting an image of disunity by forcing her out. On Sunday, critics passed around a tweet Wasserman Schultz sent last week to her counterpart at the Republican National Committee, Reince Preibus. \\"Hey @Reince ‚Äî I'm in Cleveland if you need another chair to help keep your convention in order,\\" she wrote. Priebus, who faced his own challenges managing a fractured party at the GOP's convention in Cleveland last week, told reporters Sunday that Wasserman Schultz's resignation was \\"inevitable,\\" adding \\"it shows what an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week in unifying the party.\\" ||||| (CNN) The Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday without its outgoing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, following a chaotic scene at a morning meeting where she was loudly jeered by Bernie Sanders supporters. \\"I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention,\\" Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in an interview. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who is also the Democratic National Committee's secretary, handled the gaveling instead. \\"Delegates, alternatives, standing committee members and all of our honored Democrats and other guests here in Philadelphia and all of you who have joined us by television, radio and online, here in the United States and around the world,\\" she said, \\"I hereby call the 47th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order.\\" Wasserman Schultz will also not speak tonight or throughout the duration of the convention, a Democrat close to her says. She will remain in Philadelphia until Friday when she formally steps down as leader of the committee. Wasserman Schultz changed her plans as the fallout deepened from leaked DNC emails that appeared to show the committee favoring presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders during the primary. It became clear Monday that the convention floor could erupt in anger if she gaveled the convention into session or sought to speak. And the Democratic National Committee issued an apology to Sanders moments after the convention opened, likely hoping to help soothe tensions heading into the week. \\"On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email,\\" the statement said. \\"These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not -- and will not -- tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates. Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments, and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.\\" The morning Florida delegate meeting descended into chaos when Wasserman Schultz took the stage, with critics holding up signs with the word \\"emails,\\" and Sanders supporters booing the congresswoman loudly, even after she began speaking. \\"We have to make sure that we move forward together in a unified way,\\" Wasserman Schultz said during brief remarks. \\"We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know that is not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to make jobs.\\" The audience was roughly half supportive of Wasserman Schultz and half detractors, though the angry participants were louder than the other half. Those attendees began to chant, \\"Shame! Shame! Shame!\\" while Wasserman Schultz was speaking. Sanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech Monday. \\"We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine,\\" Sanders said, which prompted some attendees to shout him down.

The drama reinforced concerns about Democratic party unity. Former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver tried to show a unified Democratic Party on Monday, the morning after Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation. \\"This happened, we knew it happened then, now is the time to go forward,' Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \\"New Day\\" on Monday. \\"Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump.\\" Wasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation, a Democratic source said. \\"Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing Clinton president] is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention,\\" Wasserman Schultz said in the statement. \\"As party chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans,\\" she said.

She had been a CNN political commentator, but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract, effective immediately, although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity, CNN said. CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her role. Separately, a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm, among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned. Chants of \\"Debbie is done!\\" and \\"Debbie resigned!\\" broke out at a pro-Sanders rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced. Party officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week. The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source. She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed. \\"She's been quarantined,\\" another top Democrat said of Wasserman Schultz, following a meeting Saturday night but before her announcement that she was leaving. Both sides of the aisle react Obama issued a statement, saying, \\"For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful.\\" And Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the party. \\"I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,\\" Clinton said. After slamming Wasserman Schultz as \\"highly overrated,\\" Trump, speaking at a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soon-to-be former DNC chair. \\"How about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton. Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton,\\" Trump said. \\"These politicians. There's no loyalty there. No loyalty. None whatsoever.\\" \\"It gets a little heat and they fire her,\\" Trump said. \\"Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take more than five minutes to make that decision.\\" Wasserman's Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus, said, \\"I think the day's events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this week.\\" \\"The extreme left will not be satisfied by one person's resignation,\\" the Republican party national chairman added. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the door. \\"Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC's email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign,\\" he said in a statement. \\"Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz's lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad.\\" Weaver called Wasserman Schultz's departure a win on CNN's \\"Erin Burnett OutFront\\" on Sunday. \\"I think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard,\\" he said. \\"And other people, frankly, in the party, Hillary Clinton supporters, who felt this was the last straw, that she had to go, and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November -- united to deal with the problem of Donald Trump.\\" Wasserman Schultz's stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process, but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly 20,000 emails. One email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders' faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters. Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement.

It goes without saying: The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates -- to be fair and even-minded.\\" He added: \\"But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\\" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Hewlett-Packard Eyes EDS - Forbes.com Hewlett-Packard is looking to acquire technology outsourcer Electronic Data Systems, the company said Monday, a deal that would help it stand out from other computer hardware makers in an increasingly difficult business. On Monday reports surfaced that computer maker Hewlett-Packard (nyse: HPQ - news - people ) was on the verge of picking up Electronic Data Systems Electronic Data Systems (nyse: EDS - news - people ) for 12 billion to 13 billion. The offer would represent a significant premium above its market value of 9.5 million based on Friday's closing price of 18.86. EDS shares soared 25.4%, or 4.79, to 23.65, on the news, while HP slipped 2.3%, or 1.13, to 48.00. Hewlett-Packard later confirmed that it was discussing \\"a possible business combination,\\" according to TradeTheNews.com. A purchase would be a smart way for HP to take on its hardware rivals like Dell (nasdaq: DELL - news - people ) and Sun Microsystems (nasdaq: JAVA - news - people ) which themselves have used EDS to support their customer-service efforts. EDS provides technology consulting and outsourcing services. The deal would make HP more competitive with International Business Machines (nyse: IBM - news - people ), which, while known as a hardware maker has derived the bulk of its sales and profit from software and services for years. Prior to Monday's shares, EDS' stock had sunk 32.4% in value over the past year, while HP has been effectively flat, rising only 3.5%. Monday's news, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes three days before HP was due to announce its second-quarter results. (See: \\"Why HP Could Cal Tech Jitters\\") Wall Street is expecting 15% growth in earnings to 84 cents per share, but investors will focus on the company's outlook to gauge the broader tech sector's health. If HP's chief executive Mark Hurd says anything Thursday that causes analysts to lower their 9.2 billion earnings forecast on sales of 114 billion, it will spark a broader tech sell off. The biggest surprise could come from HP's PC business. While PCs account for just a fraction of HP's sales, the business has been a key part of HP's resurgence over the past few years.

Summarize this article: However, one Exeter City supporter may have found a sure-fire way of getting one back for the punters. Roger Hamilton-Kendall, a lifelong fan of the Grecians, has been putting ¬£10 on his club to win 4-1 in every game they have played since April 2008 - and his side's 4-1 victory at Barnet on Saturday was the sixth time he has been able to cash in. Over the last eight years he believes he is around ¬£600 up and said the whole ritual of his bet came from a premonition he had against the League Two club's local rivals in 2008 - his first pay day. \\"I had a bit of a dream that we'd beat Torquay 4-1 in the first leg of the Conference play-off semi-final, so for a laugh I went and put a tenner on us to beat Torquay at home, but we lost 2-1,\\" he told BBC Sport. \\"I thought 'typical' and forgot about it when we were playing the second leg until I was walking up to the ground in Torquay and I saw a bookmaker, had a couple of quid in my pocket and thought 'go for it', and the rest is history.\\" Hamilton-Kendall has had wins at various prices from 33-1 up to 100-1, the odds he got when Exeter came away with three points at the Hive at the weekend - a tidy profit of ¬£1,000. But he said he has been close to a couple of more lucrative wins. \\"I was given 500-1 for us to win away at Charlton and we were 3-1 up with about 10 minutes to go and Jamie Cureton put one over the bar for ¬£5,000,\\" he added after recalling a game at The Valley in February 2011. \\"There was also an occasion where I thought I'd won it when we were 4-1 up at home to Sheffield Wednesday and we went and scored a fifth goal in the 93rd minute, but it's a lottery really and just a bit of fun. \\"But I do it every game because the one time you don't do it, it'll come in.\\" Having had three 4-1 wins in 2008, before a five-year wait for their next, Exeter have recorded two 4-1 victories so far this year. But with the Devon side hosting Cambridge on Saturday, having only picked up one point at St James Park all season, the odds of the same scoreline at 55-1 may not seem all that tempting. Summary:","completion":"Roger Hamilton-Kendall, a lifelong Exeter City fan, has been betting ¬£10 on his club to win 4-1 in every game since April 2008.

Add 201*r to both sides of the equation. 2. Simplify both sides. 3. Isolate r by dividing both sides by a constant. Let's start with the first step: Step 1: Add 201*r to both sides of the equation. -197*r + 201*r = -201*r - 4 + 201*r Step 2: Simplify both sides. On the left-hand side of the equation, we can combine the terms with r: (-197 + 201) * r = 4 * r Now, simplify the expression inside the parentheses: 4*r = -4 Step 3: Isolate r by dividing both sides by 4. r = (-4) / 4 Now simplify: r = -1 So, the solution to the equation -197*r = -201*r - 4 is r = -1."},{"prompt":"Q:What key details about yr . robert lalkovits -- axone can be extracted from the following bio?

They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser.

When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same.

Movie title: Friday Night Lights Context: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed...

They despair when they watch their beloved spend much money on extra baggage charge. Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items. But it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place. 79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being \\"just in case\\". Women plan their holiday wardrobe months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases. Professor Karen Pine said: \\"Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink. Some people find traveling stressful, particularly when they're unsure about the home comforts available at their holiday place. They over-pack to help cope with those feelings of stress and reduce the uncertainty.\\" This will come as no surprise to some men, who are used to trying to squeeze their partner's luggage into the boot of the car with their own, smaller case.

Given the question: Question: where in gospel of mark does the disciples question Christ deity I found the following answer on Google: The gospel, however, appears to rely on several underlying sources, varying in form and in theology, which tells against the tradition that the gospel was based on Peter's preaching. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No. The answer provided from Google is a general commentary on the Gospel of Mark and its potential sources. It does not specifically address the query, which is about where in the Gospel of Mark the disciples question Christ's deity. The Gospel of Mark, like the other Synoptic Gospels (Matthew and Luke), recounts the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ from the perspective of his followers. Throughout the Gospel, there are several instances where the disciples or others question Jesus' authority or do not fully understand his divine nature. For instance, in Mark 4:35-41, the disciples are on a boat with Jesus during a great storm. Jesus is asleep, and the disciples, fearing for their lives, wake him and ask, \\"Teacher, don‚Äôt you care if we drown?\\" After Jesus calms the storm, he asks them, \\"Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?\\" They were terrified and asked each other, \\"Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!\\" Here, the disciples' faith and understanding of Jesus' divine power are being probed. In Mark 8:27-29, Jesus asks his disciples directly about who they think he is, and Peter affirms that Jesus is the Christ (Messiah), demonstrating that at least by this point in the gospel, the disciples recognize and affirm Jesus' divine role. However, right after this in Mark 8:31-33, when Jesus begins to teach them about his upcoming suffering, death and resurrection, Peter rebukes Jesus, showing that he does not fully understand or accept Jesus' necessary path as the Messiah. This indicates that even though the disciples affirm Jesus is the Messiah, they do not fully understand all that this entails, including his need to suffer and die for humanity's sins. These examples and others throughout the Gospel of Mark show that while the disciples recognize Jesus as a figure of authority and power, they frequently waver in their faith and struggle to understand his full nature and role. Therefore, the Google response given does not adequately or accurately answer your question about where in the Gospel of Mark the disciples question Christ's deity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Michael and his brother Brandon grew up in the same house together. They however devoloped completely different hobbies. Michael liked to go outside and play sports. Brandon on the other hand enjoyed reading and playing games on his computer. Eventually brandon ended up having to get glasses to correct his nearsitednes while Michael did not. Which of the brothers is nearsighted, Michael or Brandon? Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, the brother who is nearsighted is Brandon. This is because he engaged in activities that required close visual work, such as reading and playing games on his computer, which may have contributed to the development of nearsightedness.

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alc√°zar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alc√°zar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.

He was speaking after the publication of a Senate report on the \\"brutal\\" CIA interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects. It said the CIA had justified its techniques with \\"inaccurate claims of their effectiveness\\", including citing foiled terror plots against the UK. The CIA has defended its actions in the years after the 9/11 attacks on the US, saying they saved lives. But the UN and human rights groups have called for the prosecution of people implicated in the report, which looked at techniques including waterboarding and sleep deprivation. The report, a 480-page executive summary of the more than 6,000-page original, said the CIA had misled politicians and the public, wrongly claiming \\"enhanced interrogation\\" had produced \\"critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence\\". One of the eight most frequently cited examples was a thwarted al-Qaeda plot to hijack planes and attack Heathrow airport and Canary Wharf, the report said. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who planned the 9/11 attacks, had decided the two locations would be \\"powerful economic symbols\\", it said. But the report said the plot had \\"not progressed beyond the initial planning stages\\" when it had been \\"fully disrupted\\", saying the the CIA's claims that its techniques had thwarted it were \\"inaccurate\\". Another example was the capture of Dhiren Barot, who was jailed for life at Woolwich Crown Court in 2006, for plotting bomb attacks in the UK and the United States. Over the years, the report said, the CIA had used the thwarting of Barot's \\"urban targets plot\\" as evidence of the effectiveness of its techniques. Again, the report said this was \\"inaccurate\\" because his capture \\"resulted from the investigative activities of UK government authorities\\". The report also highlighted what it said were \\"inaccurate\\" claims of the CIA techniques' effectiveness in relation to shoe-bomb plotter Saajid Badat, who was sentenced to 13 years in jail in 2005 for planning to blow up a passenger plane. Badat had been arrested after \\"UK domestic investigative efforts, reporting from foreign intelligence services, international law enforcement efforts, and US military\\", the report said. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Cameron's spokesman said he was not aware of any request from the UK for redactions to the Senate Intelligence Committee report. Mr Cameron had been asked about the report during a visit to Turkey. He said some activities after the 9/11 attacks had been \\"wrong\\" and pointed to a UK inquiry, by retired judge Sir Peter Gibson. Last December Sir Peter said Britain had been inappropriately involved in the rendition and ill-treatment of terror suspects. He found no evidence officers had been directly involved in the torture or rendition of suspects but raised 27 questions the Intelligence and Security Committee was considering. Mr Cameron said: \\"I'm satisfied that our system is dealing with all of these issues. \\"And I, as prime minister, have issued guidance to all of our agents and others working around the world about how they have to handle these issues in future. \\"So I'm confident that this issue has been dealt with from the British perspective, I can reassure the public about that. \\"But overall, we should be clear, torture is wrong.\\" The former reviewer of terror laws Lord Carlile has said he does not believe there should be a fresh inquiry into allegations of complicity in torture in the UK after the US Senate report on the CIA. He told BBC News: \\"We don't want an industry of inquiries when there is an absence of evidence of any serious wrongdoing by the security services here.\\" Lord Carlile said he had been speaking to \\"well-informed sources\\" and believed there was \\"nothing like the American case to be made here\\". But speaking on BBC Breakfast, Prof Paul Rogers, a lecturer in international security at the University of Bradford, said the extent of Britain's involvement was not known. He said: \\"This was an American endeavour, but we still know very little about what Britain did, and I have to say I think that's very unlikely to come out, because we have a very much more closed system in this respect than the United States.\\" Human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had \\"made a very fine attack on torture\\". But he added: \\"He should ask for the material relating to Britain - which, at the request of his government, was withheld under the protocol that allies don't spill each other's secrets - he should obtain it and publish it so we will know whether there is material to show that intelligence services from Britain have collaborated.\\" US President Barack Obama banned harsh interrogation techniques after taking office in 2009. \\"I hope that [the] report can help us leave these techniques where they belong - in the past,\\" he said. The CIA has argued that the interrogations had helped save lives. \\"The intelligence gained from the programme was critical to our understanding of al-Qaeda and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day,\\" director John Brennan said.

A powerful degreaser will cut through dirt, grime, mold, and other problematic residue without affecting the temperamental zinc coating. Proceed in small sections until you‚Äôve cleaned the entire surface. Common household products like Comet, mineral spirits, and chlorine bleach can all be used to prepare galvanized steel for painting. If you‚Äôre attempting to paint siding panels, roof flashing, or other materials that have seen exposure to the elements, a thorough cleaning is necessary to eliminate any organic contaminants from the outer surface. Once you‚Äôve finished cleaning the steel, let it rest until all traces of the degreaser have evaporated. That way, you won‚Äôt have to worry about the solution interfering with the action of the vinegar, which you‚Äôll be using to rough up the smooth steel. If possible, do your prepping and painting indoors, or on a clear day when there‚Äôs little moisture in the environment. When working with an item that‚Äôs seen some wear, you may noticed a chalky or powdery film on parts of the surface. This can easily be buffed out with a high-grit sandpaper (120-grit or finer is preferable) and a little patience. Sand the steel using gentle circular motions until the exterior takes on a uniform appearance. Afterwards, wipe the surface with a cloth dampened with warm water to remove any lingering dust. This chalky substance is commonly known as ‚Äúwhite rust.‚Äù It forms when the thin layer of zinc coating the steel begins to break down as a result of age or exposure to the elements. Wet a clean, dry cloth with distilled white vinegar and wring out the excess liquid. Go over the galvanized steel thoroughly, applying more vinegar as needed. To ensure an even paint job, it‚Äôs important that it come into contact with every part of the exterior. The acid in the vinegar will gently etch the slick zinc-coated finish, giving it a rougher texture that will allow paint to stick better. If you happen to miss a spot, you may end up with splotchy, peeling paint. This will give it plenty of time to eat away at the galvanized surface. The longer it sits, the more pronounced the etching effect will be, and the better your paint will adhere. You might even let it work overnight if the timeframe for your project allows. If you‚Äôre short on time, wait until the surface is dry to the touch before moving on to priming and painting. Summary:","completion":"This article offers a guide on preparing galvanized steel for painting by cleaning with a powerful degreaser, buffing out white rust, roughing up the surface with vinegar, and allowing it to dry thoroughly for optimal paint adhesion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. Paragraph: Two farms were growing food for several nearby cities. Vole farm grew organic produce and produced organic milk, while Anthill farm did not possess the USDA organic certification. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm had more antibiotic resistant pathogens? A:","completion":"Vole farm B: Anthill farm Based on the background information provided, organic farms have far fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens due to the restrictions on the use of antibiotics in organic practices. This means that Vole farm, which has the USDA organic certification, would have fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens compared to Anthill farm, which does not possess the certification.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the review provided, it is highly unlikely that the user would recommend this product. The user has experienced multiple issues with the pressure washer, beginning with it not restarting after running for just two hours. The retailer replaced the carburetor as a solution, however, the pressure washer only ran for 5 minutes before losing all compression. The user is now engaged in an unsatisfactory interaction with Briggs (manufacturer), who are suggesting that the user operated the machine without oil. However, the user has explicitly mentioned checking oil levels whenever refueling and finding it required oil almost every time. This indicates that the oil consumption was abnormally high, which may suggest a fault with the product. As a result, the user is understandably frustrated with the manufacturer for not taking responsibility and instead pushing the repair costs onto the user. In addition, the user expressed that they are considering switching to electric pressure washers instead, implying their dissatisfaction with the current pressure washer as well as their decreasing trust in gas-powered pressure washers due to the negative experience they've had with this particular product.

Movie title: The Three Musketeers Context: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

Tracy is a nasty person. Given the question \\"Why did Tracy do this?\\", is \\"Sneak up on Kendall\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"Sneak up on Kendall\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Tracy do this?\\" Instead, it explains the method by which Tracy tried to scare Kendall. A valid answer should provide an explanation or reason behind Tracy's actions. Based on the information provided, we can make some assumptions or speculate on possible reasons for Tracy's behavior. Here is a detailed and long answer considering multiple possibilities: Tracy might be a nasty person due to various reasons. One possible reason could be her upbringing or environment that may have fostered this type of behavior, where she developed a tendency to derive pleasure from causing discomfort to others. In this case, Tracy scared Kendall simply because she enjoys being cruel and causing distress. Another possibility is that Tracy might feel threatened or jealous of Kendall. These feelings of jealousy or insecurity could lead her to behave negatively towards Kendall in an attempt to belittle or undermine her. By scaring Kendall, Tracy could have been attempting to assert her dominance or establish a perceived sense of superiority. Additionally, Tracy's actions could be a reflection of her own internal struggles or insecurities. Sometimes, individuals project their own insecurities and fears onto others as a coping mechanism. In scaring Kendall, Tracy might have been trying to shift her negative emotions or gain a temporary sense of control over her own fears by triggering them in someone else. Lastly, Tracy's nastiness may have been a learned behavior from her experiences with others who have treated her similarly in the past. It's possible that Tracy herself has been a victim of nasty people trying to scare her, and as a result, she has adopted this behavior in her interactions with others, such as Kendall. In summary, \\"Sneak up on Kendall\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Tracy do this?\\" as it only explains the action but doesn't provide the underlying reason. A better answer should consider why Tracy wanted to scare Kendall in the first place, potentially exploring the different possibilities such as upbringing, jealousy, personal insecurities, or past experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup.

Since 2009, he has sold over 3 million albums and 5 million singles worldwide. Lambert rose to fame in 2009 after finishing as runner-up on the eighth season of American Idol. Later that year, he released his debut album, For Your Entertainment, which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. Critics, celebrities and colleagues have been outspoken in their praise for Lambert's vocal command. Kathie Bretches-Urban, co-founder of Metropolitan Educational Theatre Network (now MET2) where Lambert performed as a youth, said \\"He has invested his entire life in music and performing ... He'd just come out onstage, and it popped\\". Record producer Rob Cavallo once described Lambert as having an unlimited range, and able to sing every note on a guitar from the lowest to the highest. In a March 2012 interview, rock artist Meat Loaf rated Lambert's voice in the company of only two others, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, based on \\"that jet pack quality to their voice that just lets it take off.\\" Lambert's total recorded vocal range spans from bass E to B flat above tenor high C (E2 - B5), giving him three octaves and six semitones. In 2011, when he took the stage at the MTV Europe Music Awards, honoree Queen guitarist Brian May noted that Lambert's voice has \\"sensitivity, depth, maturity, and awesome range and power which will make jaws drop\\"; while Roger Taylor added that Lambert had \\"the best range I've ever heard\\" in a BBC interview in 2012. Pharrell Williams, after collaborating with Lambert on his Trespassing album, commented, \\"This kid has a voice like a siren - there's no guys singing in that Steve Winwood-Peter Cetera range.\\" In October 2012, British tabloid the Sunday Mirror reported that Lambert had insured his voice for 48 million.

Rubbing Alcohol or Nail Polish Remover These substances are capable of dissolving many adhesive residues. To use this method: - Soak a cotton ball or cloth with rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. - Gently rub the adhesive residue with the soaked material until it starts to dissolve. - Wipe away the dissolved residue with a clean cloth or paper towel. - Rinse the area with water to remove any remaining residue or cleaning agent. 2. White Vinegar White vinegar is a natural, non-toxic solution that can effectively remove adhesive residue left by masking tape. To use this method: - Soak a cloth or paper towel with white vinegar. - Lay the soaked cloth over the residue and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. - Rub the residue gently until it dissolves. - Wipe the area with a clean, damp cloth to remove any remaining residue or vinegar. 3. Commercial Degreasing Agents There are various commercial degreasing agents available at most supermarkets and hardware stores, which can be effective at removing adhesive residues from glass surfaces. To use this method: - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and proper use. - Apply the degreasing agent to the adhesive residue. - Allow the product to sit for the recommended time. - Gently rub the residue to dissolve it. - Rinse the glass with water to remove any remaining residue or cleaning agent. 4. WD-40 or Paint Thinner These multipurpose lubricants and solvents can be used to break down stubborn adhesive residues. To use this method: - Apply WD-40 or a small amount of paint thinner to the sticky residue using a cloth, cotton ball, or spray, if using WD-40. - Allow the lubricant or solvent to sit for a few minutes to dissolve the residue. - Rub the area gently until the adhesive residue dislodges. - Clean the area with water and a clean cloth to remove any remaining residue or solvent. 5. Lighter Fluid Lighter fluid is another option for dissolving adhesive residues, but it should be used with caution due to its flammability. To use this method: - Apply a small amount of lighter fluid to a cloth or cotton ball. - Gently rub the residue with the soaked material. - Once the residue dissolves, wipe the area clean with a damp cloth. - Rinse the glass with water to remove any remaining residue or lighter fluid. 6. Heat Using heat can help to soften adhesive residues, making them easier to remove. To use this method: - Direct a hair dryer or heat gun at the adhesive residue, maintaining a safe distance to avoid overheating the glass. - As the residue begins to soften, gently rub or scrape it off with a plastic scraper or cloth. - Clean the area with a damp cloth to remove any remaining residue. Conclusion Adhesive residues on glass surfaces can be unsightly and challenging to remove, but with these six techniques, you'll be able to tackle even the most stubborn residues. Remember always to use caution when employing these methods, especially when working with flammable solvents. By following these steps, you'll have a clean, residue-free glass surface in no time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Paragraph: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person learned more about isostasy? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background paragraph, it can be concluded that Barry, being a geologist specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor, would have learned more about isostasy compared to Will, who specializes in montology. The reasoning behind this conclusion lies in the direct association of isostasy with the processes occurring in subduction zones and the formation of new seafloor. Isostasy deals with the equilibrium and vertical adjustments that the Earth's crust undergoes to maintain a balance amidst various geological events. In the context of the oceanic crust, this is particularly relevant to the phenomena of seafloor spreading, cooling, and subduction. As new oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and spreads apart, it cools down and becomes denser, causing the older, colder seafloor to sink deeper into the mantle. This sinking, or subduction, creates an equilibrium to balance the continuous generation of new oceanic crust, thus playing a crucial role in understanding isostatic adjustments. Since Barry specializes in subduction zones and new seafloor, his area of expertise directly involves studying processes related to isostasy. On the other hand, Will specializes in montology, which refers to the study of mountains and their formation. Although isostasy may play a role in some aspects of montology, it is not the main focus of Will's specialization. In conclusion, given the respective areas of expertise of Barry and Will, it can be deduced that Barry, with his specialization in subduction zones and new seafloor, would have more in-depth knowledge and understanding of isostasy compared to Will, who specializes in montology."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence which is either in the Swedish language or English language.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"Yes\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\" based on the given paragraph.

Recent years, KFC has ever shocked us more than once because of its food safety, which made itself in severe trust crisis. Now it greatly surprised us again owing to the poultry incident. We could never believe it should have cheated us again and again. In fact, as a well-known restaurant chain, KFC's business records at China's is not very good. There's no doubt that the very incident has made things worse and worse. However, what surprised us is that although a series of misdeeds had reduced KFC's reputation, its business is increasing. What's more, KFC just made a so-called apology after what had happened, the content of which is not responsible at all for the public. As a matter of fact, this is not an ordinary chance incident. Recent years have seen so many food-safety problems in China, such as wasted oil, lean meat powder , melamine , which has done great damage to people's life. We don't know what can be eaten and how much harmful food we have eaten. Now it is not wars and natural disasters but everyday food safety that has been a great risk to human health. So what can be done to prevent our health from being damaged? To begin with, the related departments should strengthen laws to stop such illegal products from being produced. In addition, it would be a good idea to call on the media to perform its further function to monitor the businesses, factories and traders. Besides, everybody should be made aware of the risks of harmful food and only in this way can people improve their self-protection. In a word, everyone should play a role in making our food safer and better in quality. Meanwhile, the government and the related departments should take their responsibilities for people's health.

New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race.

Please answer the following question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Wong posted the rejection letter to her Tumblr blog, sparking a wave of support on social media sites. \\"Smith is a women's college, which means that undergraduate applicants to Smith must be female at the time of admission,\\" the rejection letter, signed by the Dean of Admission, Debra Shaver, reads. \\"Your FAFSA indicates your gender as male. Therefore, Smith cannot process your application.\\" Members of Smith College varsity crew team, Smith alumni and students at other colleges pose with signs saying \\"Trans Women belong at Smith\\" on Facebook.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"While both questions center around the desire to lose weight quickly, their phrasing and context are slightly different. The first question specifically requests advice for losing weight rapidly within a 14-day period, while the second question is more general, focusing on the need for serious help regarding quick weight loss. Although these distinctions exist, the underlying theme in both questions is, indeed, similar. To lose weight rapidly within a 14-day period, a comprehensive plan to adjust one's diet, increase physical activity, and develop healthy habits is crucial. Here's a detailed plan of action: **1. Set realistic goals:** Determine how much weight is intended or deemed safe to lose during the 14 days. Generally, 1 to 2 pounds per week is considered a safe and manageable rate of weight loss. **2. Track calorie intake:** Begin tracking the foods consumed, and manage daily calorie intake, as burning more calories than taken in is essential for weight loss. The average woman typically requires around 1500-1800 calories per day, and the average man approximately 1800-2200. However, this may vary based on individual factors like age, weight, and activity level. **3. Create a caloric deficit:** A caloric deficit of 500 to 1000 calories per day can result in a weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. Focus on eating nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods like green leafy vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats, while cutting back on processed and high-calorie foods. **4. Increase physical activity and exercise:** Engage in regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, or group exercise classes. Aim for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity weekly. Include strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least 2 days per week. **5. Drink plenty of water:** Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health and can help in weight loss by promoting satiety, increasing metabolism, and flushing out toxins. **6. Opt for smaller, more frequent meals:** Breaking daily food intake into smaller, more frequent meals or snacks can keep the metabolism active and help regulate blood sugar levels, reducing the likelihood of overeating at meal times. **7. Prioritize sleep:** Aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep nightly, as sufficient rest supports the body's metabolism, hormone regulation, and overall weight management efforts. **8. Manage stress:** Implement stress-management techniques like mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, or meditation, as stress can lead to weight gain or interfere with weight loss efforts. Please note that rapid weight loss may not be sustainable in the long term and can result in regaining weight or encountering health issues. It is always recommended to consult a healthcare professional before undertaking drastic weight-loss plans to ensure the methods employed are both safe and effective for the individual."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is a very short summary of the above text?","completion":"The U.S. State Department announced on Tuesday that it has extended a waiver of missile proliferation sanctions for specific activities conducted by the Chinese government. In order to provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of this brief news item, it is important to first explain some of the key terms and concepts. A waiver in this context refers to an agreed suspension or relaxation of a rule or regulation. Usually, this is granted when compliance with the specified requirement(s) is deemed infeasible or unnecessary in a particular case or for a specified period. In this case, the U.S. has provided an extension, or prolongation, of an existing waiver. The missile proliferation sanctions mentioned in the news piece refer to penalties imposed by one or more countries on others for breaches in internationally agreed-upon standards for the development, testing, production, acquisition, transfer, deployment, or use of missiles, especially those capable of carrying nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. These sanctions are typically intended to discourage countries from engaging in the spread (or \\"proliferation\\") of such weapons, which is considered a threat to global peace and security. This can include export control sanctions that limit the potential for sharing missile technology, as well as broader economic, diplomatic, or even military penalties. The reference to certain Chinese government activities suggests that those specific actions or operations conducted by China have been judged as not contravening the spirit of restrictions against missile proliferation, or that it's in the U.S.' national interest to refrain from enforcing such sanctions in those specific instances. What those activities are, however, is not specified in the provided text. The U.S. State Department is the national executive department responsible for the international relations of the United States. This means it's the entity that communicates and negotiates with foreign governments like China and decides how the U.S. interacts with them, including whether or not to impose or waive sanctions. Given the geopolitical significance of missile development and the ongoing competition between the U.S. and China in the military, economic, and technological domains, such decisions are typically based on extensive deliberations involving defense, intelligence, and foreign affairs experts. In summary, this brief news piece announces that the U.S., through its State Department, has opted to prolong a relaxations of certain missile proliferation sanctions against specific activities performed by the Chinese not specified in the text. This highlights an aspect of the complex and multifaceted relationship between the two major powers, while inviting questions about the exact nature of the exempted activities and the strategic considerations underlying the decision to maintain the waiver."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

McCain Picks Alaska Governor; Palin First Woman on GOP Ticket The senator from Arizona lived up to his maverick reputation, bypassing former rivals and more experienced governors to choose the little-known Palin, 44, as the person \\"who can best help me shake up Washington.\\" The self-described \\"hockey mom\\" brings a blue-collar conservatism and strong antiabortion views to the ticket and appeals to a party base sometimes suspicious of McCain. She made an immediate pitch to female voters, especially those who had supported Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries, saying that her selection \\"could help shatter the glass ceiling once and for all.\\" But she is also less than two years into her term as governor, and her only previous political experience came as mayor of the town of Wasilla, which has a population of about 6,700. Democrats immediately seized on her lack of political experience, noting that McCain, who turned 72 on Friday, will be confirmed next week as the oldest first-time presidential nominee in history. After a raucous rally here before what the campaign said were 15,000 supporters -- the largest gathering of McCain's campaign -- the two spent six hours together. They traveled by bus to Pittsburgh, ingratiating themselves to Ohioans as they bought Ohio State Buckeye paraphernalia and stopped for ice cream at a roadside stand. The trip provided valuable bonding time for two people who acknowledge they barely know each other. McCain met Palin at a governor's conference in February, and did not see her again until she secretly flew to Arizona on Wednesday night. After a phone interview with the senator on Sunday night, she arrived in the state three days later for a session with McCain's two top lieutenants. She met with McCain's wife, Cindy, on Thursday morning at the couple's Sedona ranch, then McCain joined them and offered her the job on the deck of the house around 11 a.m. Thursday. While Palin, pronounced PAY-lin, had been mentioned as a dark-horse candidate for the job, she was never described as being on the shortlist under consideration by McCain. Those who were -- including former presidential rival Mitt Romney, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) -- had spent months doing surrogate duty for McCain around the country, something Palin had not been called on to do. There were reports of bruised feelings, especially because the McCain campaign's ironclad resolve to keep news of the pick from leaking meant some of the finalists were not told they were not chosen until the last minute. McCain and Democratic rival Barack Obama, opposites in so many ways, took dramatically different paths in making their vice presidential selections. Obama, 47, a first-term senator from Illinois who is battling the charge that he lacks the experience for the job, chose 65-year-old Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 35-year member of the Senate and a foreign policy expert. McCain, a war hero and world traveler who has served in Congress for more than a quarter-century, selected a woman who has no national or international experience and is younger than two of his children, but who he said shares his belief in reform and relishes the role of outsider. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Senator John McCain selected Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate for the 2008 Presidential election, making her the first woman on a Republican ticket. Palin, 44, has a strong conservative background and antiabortion stance, appealing to the Republican base.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two brothers had very different diets. Vick would constantly eat foods high in fat and would frequently overeat. Zack on the other hand, had a higher metabolic rate, a faster metabolism, and he would eat the correct amount of calories. Which brother had a lower chance of developing type 2 diabetes? Hint: Any unused energy in food‚Äîwhether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids‚Äîis stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person‚Äôs weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person‚Äôs height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A:","completion":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, Zack has a lower chance of developing type 2 diabetes compared to Vick. Here is a detailed explanation as to why this is the case: 1. Diet and Caloric Intake: The diets of the two brothers are significantly different. Vick's diet consists of foods high in fat, and he tends to overeat. Overeating can lead to consuming more calories than the body requires for energy, resulting in the excess calories being stored as body fat. On the other hand, Zack consumes an appropriate amount of calories, which indicates that his diet possibly consists of a balanced and moderate intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids without exceeding his caloric needs. 2. Metabolism: Zack has a higher metabolic rate and a faster metabolism, which means he burns calories more efficiently than Vick. This reduces the chance of unused energy being stored as fat and helps in maintaining a healthier body weight. 3. Body Mass Index (BMI) and Obesity: Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. As mentioned, obesity occurs when a person's BMI is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. Vick's unhealthy dietary habits and overeating have a higher chance of causing him to become obese. On the other hand, Zack's healthier eating habits and appropriate caloric intake, combined with his higher metabolism, are less likely to result in obesity. 4. The risk of Type 2 Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Obesity, as well as the accumulation of body fat, particularly around the abdomen, has been associated with increased insulin resistance and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, Zack's healthier diet, appropriate caloric intake, and higher metabolic rate significantly lower his risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Consequently, Zack has a lower chance of developing type 2 diabetes compared to Vick, whose unhealthy diet and overeating habits increase his likelihood of obesity, leading to an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes. It's important for Vick to reconsider his dietary choices, portion control, and engage in physical activities to help lower his risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 5 reasons not to skip La Paz A glimpse of La Paz, Bolivia A glimpse of La Paz, Bolivia A glimpse of La Paz, Bolivia A glimpse of La Paz, Bolivia A glimpse of La Paz, Bolivia La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- It's easy to write off Bolivia's largest city as just another congested, chaotic Latin American metropolis. As more international travelers discover Bolivia for its biodiversity, where they can explore the Andes, the Amazon basin and the world's largest salt lake in one visit, La Paz is their most likely point of entry. But to most, it's little more than that -- a place to spend a day or two sipping coca tea and adjust to life at 10,000 feet while planning adventures. The congestion and chaos quickly become apparent as you descend the Altiplano to the \\"bowl\\" of the downtown core, a tangled maze of steep and winding streets. The cultural legacy of Bolivia's largest indigenous groups, the Quechua and Aymara, permeate the busy urban landscape, where vehicles compete with pedestrians and sidewalk vendors. With elevations ranging from 9,800 to 13,450 feet, \\"the city that touches the sky\\" has plenty of distinctions that come in handy in bar trivia: home of the world's highest international airport and highest seat of government. Its elevation also makes for extreme temperature: sunny, hot days and cold, windy nights. But a closer look reveals some unexpected surprises that aren't spelled out in tour guides. Flanked by the Iglesia de San Francisco, a noisy thoroughfare and a busy side street, Plaza San Francisco is not the prettiest public space La Paz has to offer, but it's a great place to people-watch. Women dressed in traditional indigenous style of bowler hats and poofy petticoats, babies slung over their shoulders in colorful wraps, wait for buses alongside teens in skinny jeans and heavy eye makeup. Vendors in blue jumpsuits push around carts of ice cream which everyone seems to be eating. The San Francisco church is worth a visit in itself. Its stone-carved facade is in the intricate style of 16-century baroque and mestizo architecture. A tour of the basilica and cloister offers an overview of La Paz's founding and fight for independence, along with an opportunity to glimpse the city from the bell tower. The city's last remaining example of what a street looked like in colonial times could be considered one of the most touristy parts of La Paz, owing to the polish of its refurbished structures. But in a busy metropolis that doesn't go out of its way to cater to tourists, it's a peaceful stretch of cobblestone and colorful buildings that brings to mind other colonial cities like Antigua, Guatemala, or Campeche, Mexico. Step inside one of the dimly-lit bars or restaurants and you'll find quiet courtyards shielded from the bustle of the city. The street is home to four museums in colonial homes, noteworthy for their architecture as much as their exhibits. Museo de Casa Murillo -- former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, one of the martyrs of the La Paz Independence movement of July 16, 1809 -- features paintings, furniture and clothing from an era when La Paz was torn between loyalty to the Spanish viceroy and support for indigenous rights. At the Museo de Instrumentos Musicales, also a school and meeting place for aspiring musicians, visitors are likely to stumble upon a jam session of charango players or pan flutists. Students of the school often put on Saturday night performances, where you might catch a guitar duet performed by a 7-year-old prodigy and his Japanese instructor. Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore If you're in Bolivia long enough, chances are you'll stumble on a parade or celebration where traditional Bolivian song and dance is the centerpiece (yet another reason to stick around La Paz on the weekend). The colorful costumes and masks, representative of dances from different regions and evocative of the film, \\"Return to Oz,\\" might leave the uninitiated wondering what the heck is going on. The Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore offers some explanation for why horned devil masks and caricatures of African slaves figure prominently in folklore in an impressive display of masks and costumes. For extra trivia, check out the exhibit on the participation of transvestites in cultural celebrations of the late 20th century. Most Wednesdays, the museum keeps its doors open late for a show by the renowned Ballet Folkl√≥rico de La Paz, in which dancers decked out in full garb demonstrate customs from various regions, minus the drunken revelry of the street. Local markets, Witches Market, Calles Sagarnaga and Linares Most Western tourists will have little use for items at local markets. But they're good for getting a sense of how Bolivians shop and what seems to be popular: puffy corn resembling Styrofoam, exotic seeds, reams of multi-colored fabric, shoes and underwear, cell phone chips, kitchen accessories, a shoe shine, keys made by hand. Those who've never seen a dried llama or alpaca fetus would do well to check out Witches Market, which also offers charms and herbs that purport to prolong sexual encounters or attract secret crushes. Vendors down the street on Calle Linares down to Sagarnaga sell the traditional goods that tourists tend to look for in South America -- colorful hats and scarves made of alpaca and llama wool bearing images of alpacas and llamas, colorful rugs and textiles, jewelry with indigenous designs, all cheaper than you'll find similar items in Peru or Chile. At the local markets, tucked among the stalls of clothes and housekeeping products, foreigners can eat like a local at the same prices as a local, 1 to 2 on average. Eating in the street is not for everyone, especially those with sensitive stomachs, but it's worth for the risk for those willing to try. Bolivia is a meat and potatoes kind of country, with a knack for throwing fried eggs on the side and a few pieces of yucca if you're lucky. Women push around carts that double as kitchen counters from which they prepare full course meals, from lechon to empanadas to roasted pork sandwiches. At night, more roving carts appear, offering tripe or hamburgers and hot dogs and salchipapas (sausages and french fries). Fresh fruit juice stands are abundant, but should also be approached with caution. Cups of pear juice with a fuzzy pit resting at the bottom may remind you of the llama fetus at Witches Market, but drink it and you'll be treated to one of the sweetest drinks without artificial sweetener you'll ever try. Don't forget to suck on the pit when you're done!","completion":"La Paz, Bolivia's largest city, offers a unique cultural experience for travelers who choose not to skip it on their journey through the country. With its indigenous influences, rich history, and bustling local markets, La Paz provides an authentic taste of Bolivian life. Visitors can learn about the city's founding and fight for independence at the San Francisco Church, while exploring its museums offers insight into the country's art, music, and folklore. Local markets and street food, featuring traditional Bolivian ingredients and dishes, provide a culinary adventure for the adventurous eater. La Paz is more than just a point of entry for Bolivia's natural wonders and should not be overlooked."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Minutes later, her voice took on a tougher tone: \\"I'll tell you one thing, y'all ain't going back to the state of Mississippi. I'll tell you that. Y'all ain't going there to get a drink of water.\\" Her daughters, Gladys and Jamie Scott, were released from a Mississippi prison Friday after 16 years behind bars. Gov. Haley Barbour suspended their armed robbery sentences on one condition -- that one sister donate a kidney to the other. And","completion":"so began a new chapter in the lives of Gladys and Jamie Scott, two sisters intricately entwined in a tale of crime, punishment, and redemption. The case of the Scott sisters captured national headlines and ignited debates around issues of race, crime, and the criminal justice system in the United States. The story of the Scott sisters began in 1993 when the two African-American women were accused and subsequently convicted of an armed robbery in Forest, Mississippi. The sisters, then aged 19 and 22, maintained their innocence but were found guilty and handed down extraordinarily harsh sentences -- both were to serve two life sentences for a crime that netted only 11. Throughout their trial and subsequent imprisonment, the Scott sisters garnered the attention and support of numerous civil rights and social activists who questioned the severity of their sentences. Their supporters argued that the harsh punishments were racially motivated and underscored a pattern of systemic racial bias in the criminal justice system. As years passed, the public outcry over the sisters' imprisonment grew, eventually catching the attention of Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. Faced with mounting pressure, Governor Barbour decided to grant the sisters an indefinite suspension of their sentences on one condition -- that Gladys donate a kidney to her sister Jamie, who was suffering from kidney failure. This unprecedented move by Gov. Barbour was met with mixed reactions. Some saw it as a compassionate gesture that would help save the life of Jamie, while others viewed it as a coercive and ethically questionable use of the power of clemency. Nonetheless, the sisters accepted the condition and were released from prison in January 2011, reuniting with their mother in Pensacola, Florida. As observed by their mother, Evelyn Rasco, any thoughts of returning to Mississippi were swiftly dismissed, highlighting the deep emotional scars left by the sisters' harrowing experience. In their newfound freedom, the Scott sisters have become vocal advocates for criminal justice reform, lending their voices to the ongoing conversation on the impact of race in the U.S. justice system. Their story highlights the significant obstacles many minority individuals face, not only within the legal system but also in accessing adequate healthcare and organ transplants. As Gladys and Jamie Scott embark on this new chapter in their lives, their story serves as a poignant reminder of the need for a more equitable and just society. It underscores the importance of addressing racial disparities in the criminal justice system to ensure that all individuals receive fair treatment and sentencing commensurate with their actions. The Scott sisters' case highlights the critical need for a system that values compassion, rehabilitation, and ultimately, a chance for redemption."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"When blood sugar levels increase in the body, it affects the glucose production and regulation process directly and indirectly. Elevated blood sugar levels can lead to various perturbations in the blood sugar regulation process. Before diving into the details of the perturbations, let's first understand how the blood sugar levels are maintained in the body. The blood sugar level increases when you eat, and the body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. The glucose enters the bloodstream for the cells to use as energy. The pancreas senses this rise in blood sugar levels and releases insulin, a hormone that helps the cells take up glucose. This process helps to lower blood sugar levels. However, suppose the blood sugar level increases beyond the normal range. In that case, it might lead directly or indirectly to perturbations in the blood sugar regulation process, such as insulin resistance and disruption in the glucose production process. Here's a detailed analysis of the possible perturbations: 1. Directly Impacting a Step of the Process: Increased blood sugar levels can directly impact insulin production and function. When the blood sugar level rises persistently, the pancreas overworks to produce more and more insulin. Over time, the cells become less responsive to insulin, a condition known as insulin resistance. This causes the pancreas to produce even more insulin, further straining its capacity and sometimes leading to dysfunction. Moreover, insulin resistance causes the liver to malfunction and not store the excess glucose as glycogen. Instead, it continues to release it into the bloodstream, causing the blood sugar levels to remain high. 2. Indirectly Impacting a Step of the Process: Elevated blood sugar levels can indirectly affect the blood sugar regulation process in several ways. High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels, impairing blood flow and nutrient delivery to cells. This may lead to the cells struggling to access the glucose they need for energy, leading to a decrease in overall energy production. Furthermore, increased blood sugar levels can exacerbate inflammation, which might indirectly impact the blood sugar regulation process. Inflammation can impair cell function, reducing their ability to respond to insulin and take up glucose. In conclusion, both the direct and indirect perturbations related to increased blood sugar levels can significantly impact the glucose production and regulation process. Mismanagement of chronically high blood sugar may lead to serious health complications such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She drank coffee and smoked my father's cigarettes and paced between the sofa and the TV. Next morning she threatened to pack up and leave, so Dad drove to the store and hurried back. He sprayed poison from a jug. When he was finished he told us that was the end of it. For a couple of weeks we went back to find dead crickets in the laundry. He suggested that we'd all be better off to hide as many as we could from Mamma. I fed a few dozen to the cat who I didn't like because he scratched for no reason.

Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds.

The Lascanx caves hold ancient colorful paintings. (D). Drawings of horses are on the walls of the Lascaux caves. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Imagine looking for your lost dog. You step into a cave . But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck? There is one thing the paintings seem to tell us. The Cro- Magnons were interested in the world. They looked at beauty and they understood it. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The main idea of the passage is the discovery and detailed description of the ancient cave paintings in the Lascaux caves in France. These paintings, discovered by four French boys in 1940 and estimated to be 17,000 years old, were made by the Cro-Magnon people. The large and colorful depictions of various animals including horses, deer, bison, and bulls, sprawling across walls and ceilings, showcase the artistic skill of these ancient people. The passage also reflects on the possible motives behind this artwork, like invoking magical power or bringing good luck, ultimately highlighting the Cro-Magnons' curiosity and appreciation of the world around them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Where the Beat Meets the Street is the second studio album by Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and his side - project , Bobby and the Midnites . The album reached number 166 on the Billboard 200 . - Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 to February 1971 and from October 1974 to August 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname \\"the rhythm devils\\". - Robert Hall \\"Bob\\" Weir (born October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016. - Bobby and the Midnites was a rock group led by Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. The band was Weir's main side project during the first half of the 1980s. They released two albums, but were better known for their live concerts than for their work in the recording studio. With a rhythm section that included jazz veterans Billy Cobham and, for a time, Alphonso Johnson, Bobby and the Midnites played rock music that was influenced by jazz-rock fusion. - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes. - Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career. - The Other Ones was an American rock band formed in 1998 by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with part-time Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. In 2000, Bill Kreutzmann, another Grateful Dead alumnus, joined the group, while Phil Lesh dropped out. In 2002, Lesh rejoined the band, and Hornsby left. At different times the shifting lineup of The Other Ones also included Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, John Molo, Dave Ellis, Alphonso Johnson, Jimmy Herring, Rob Barraco, Jeff Chimenti, and Susan Tedeschi. In 2003, The Other Ones changed their name to The Dead. - Deadhead or Dead Head is a name given to fans of the American psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead. In the 1970s, a number of fans began travelling to see the band in as many shows or festival venues as they could. With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed. Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubsrefining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, \\"Inside Wants Out\\". His following two full-length albums\\"Room for Squares\\" (2001) and \\"Heavier Things\\" (2003)did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\". - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - William \\"Bill\\" Kreutzmann, Jr. (born May 7, 1946) is an American drummer. He played with the Grateful Dead for its entire thirty-year career, usually alongside fellow drummer Mickey Hart, and has continued to perform with former members of the Grateful Dead in various lineups, and with his own bands BK3, 7 Walkers and Billy & the Kids. - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. - RatDog (sometimes known as The Ratdog Revue, Bob Weir & RatDog or Ratdog) is an American rock band. The group began as a side project for Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and bassist Rob Wasserman. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in December 1995 following the death of Jerry Garcia on August 9 of that year, RatDog became Bob Weir's primary band. The band performed until July, 2014. They performed Grateful Dead tunes primarily with a mixture of covers (including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry songs), along with some originals. RatDog's repertoire consisted of more than 150 songs.

Question: What will cause a reevaluation for the characters? Movie plot title: Wilby Wonderful Movie plot: The small Canadian Maritimes island town of Wilby is preparing for its annual fair as a scandal threatens to rock its very foundation: the local newspaper is about to publish details and names of men caught during a police raid at Wilby Watch, a large undeveloped area on the island. In the midst of it, Wilby's inhabitants attempt to maintain business as usual. Overbusy realtor Carol French is trying to sell the mayor her late mother-in-law√¢¬Ä¬ôs house while supervising the festival, trying to achieve her social ambitions while painfully trying to avoid her husband's efforts to discuss their marriage. Her police officer husband, good-natured Buddy, investigating the rumors of gay sex and drugs at the Watch with his partner Stan, is distracted by his burgeoning love affair with former high school classmate Sandra Anderson. Sandra just got back to the island and re-opened a coffee shop, her bad reputation as a promiscuous woman a painful fact in her life. Sandra√¢¬Ä¬ôs teenaged daughter Emily resentfully observes her mother's doings; she's hoping for a serious romance different from her mom's history, but her boyfriend may have more basic intentions. After his wife has left him in the wake of the pending gay scandal, the new-to-town depressive video store owner Dan Jarvis keeps trying to kill himself and Duck MacDonald, the town√¢¬Ä¬ôs handyman, keeps interrupting his attempts. Duck remains stoic in front of the turmoil, seemingly the only one (silently) recognizing everyone else's dramas while himself persistently seeking Dan's company. And the town's mayor may be playing up the scandal in order to conclude a deal to turn the Watch into a golf course. The scandal will force the characters to reevaluate their lives and come to terms with their own secrets and lies.

As details and names of the men caught during the police raid at Wilby Watch are about to be published in the local newspaper, the inhabitants of the town are forced to confront the reality of the situation and deal with their personal issues and secrets. For Carol French, the overbusy realtor, she will need to reevaluate her social ambitions and face the truth about her marriage as her husband, Buddy, tries to discuss it with her. While trying to maintain her public image, she will realize the implications of the scandal on her life and her relationships. Buddy, Carol's police officer husband, investigating the rumors at Wilby Watch, will be forced to reevaluate his love affair with Sandra Anderson and the impact it has on his life as the scandal unfolds. He will need to make important decisions and reflect on how his relationships are influencing his personal happiness. Sandra Anderson, the woman with a troubled past trying to start a new life, will be faced with the consequences of her reputation being exposed in the midst of the scandal. This will lead her to reevaluate her choices and relationships, especially the impact on her daughter Emily, who is resenting her mother's past. Emily, Sandra's teenage daughter, will reevaluate her romantic aspirations as she observes her mother's actions and deals with potential betrayal from her boyfriend. She will learn important lessons about relationships and expectations through the scandal and its impact on her life. For Dan Jarvis, the new-to-town depressive video store owner, the scandal brings out unresolved issues in his personal life and prompts him to reflect on the reasons behind his wife leaving him. As Duck MacDonald keeps interrupting Dan's suicide attempts, Dan will be forced to reevaluate his decision to end his life and face the reality of his situation in Wilby. Duck MacDonald, the town's handyman, will also undergo a reevaluation as the stoic observer of others' dramas while persistently seeking Dan's company. His relationship with Dan may help him confront his own insecurities and delve deeper into the reasons behind his actions. Lastly, the town's mayor may have to reevaluate his intentions and the consequences of his actions as the scandal unfolds, and he uses it to his advantage to pursue a deal to turn the Watch into a golf course. The impact of his decisions on the town and its inhabitants will force him to reflect on his true motives and the values he holds dear. Overall, the scandal in \\"Wilby Wonderful\\" serves as the catalyst for a reevaluation of each character's life, relationships, and priorities. As their secrets and lies are brought to the surface, they are each faced with the opportunity to confront their personal issues, make important decisions, and ultimately, grow from the experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Bloomberg Says Cities Will Fight Climate Change, With or Without Trump Donald J. Trump has said climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese to get the United States to suppress its manufacturing sector. That prompted a public rebuttal last week from a Chinese official attending a climate summit meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the strict climate-denier viewpoint embraced by many Republicans in an interview with The New York Times, saying that there was ‚Äúsome connectivity‚Äù between human activity and climate change. He also said he wanted to keep an ‚Äúopen mind‚Äù about whether to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the main global climate change accord. Mr. Trump‚Äôs opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in January. But officials from China, which has surpassed the United States as the world‚Äôs largest emitter of greenhouse gas, have said they will move forward on climate policies without the Americans, if it comes to that. On Tuesday, Michael R. Bloomberg, the media tycoon and former mayor of New York City, said that American cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what Mr. Trump and the federal government decided to do. Mr. Bloomberg made his remarks in Washington at a talk hosted by the China General Chamber of Commerce. They were adapted for an op-ed article published Tuesday by Bloomberg View under the headline, ‚ÄúWashington Won‚Äôt Have Last Word on Climate Change.‚Äù Mr. Bloomberg, a longtime advocate for action on climate change, praised Xie Zhenhua, China‚Äôs climate envoy, for saying China remained committed to tackling the issue. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a responsible thing to do for the Chinese people and the world,‚Äù he said. Mr. Bloomberg added that if Mr. Trump decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, then he would urge the mayors of 128 cities in the United States who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement. Following is a central passage from Mr. Bloomberg‚Äôs op-ed article: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you what Donald Trump‚Äôs administration will do ‚Äî and in all fairness, they will need time to figure it out themselves. What‚Äôs said on the campaign trail is one thing; actually carrying out a specific policy is another. I hope they‚Äôll recognize the importance of the issue. But I am confident that no matter what happens in Washington, no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or rescinds, no matter what laws the next Congress may pass, we will meet the pledges that the U.S. made in Paris. ‚ÄúThe reason is simple: Cities, businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions, because they have concluded ‚Äî just as China has ‚Äî that doing so is in their own self-interest. ‚ÄúThe U.S.‚Äôs success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on Washington. Bear in mind: Over the past decade, Congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change. Yet at the same time, the U.S. has led the world in reducing emissions. ‚ÄúThat progress has been driven by cities, businesses and citizens ‚Äî and none of them are letting up now. Just the opposite: All are looking for ways to expand their efforts. Mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate change.‚Äù Mr. Bloomberg‚Äôs remarks dovetail with recent ones made by American mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from Mr. Trump on critical issues. Among others, the mayors of New York, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia and Washington have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In his visit with reporters and editors at The New York Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said of the Paris Agreement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.‚Äù In addressing the climate issue, he also said, ‚ÄúClean air is vitally important.‚Äù Mr. Trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog. It is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic air, a severe problem in Chinese cities. Greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source ‚Äî in many cases, industrial coal-burning ‚Äî so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues. The United States and China have made pledges to curb the use of coal. Mr. Bloomberg concluded the op-ed article published Tuesday with this thought: ‚ÄúWashington will not have the last word on the fate of the Paris Agreement in the U.S. ‚Äî mayors will, together with business leaders and citizens.‚Äù","completion":"Regardless of the decisions made by President-elect Donald Trump, cities across the US will continue to pursue climate policies, according to Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City. In an op-ed for Bloomberg View, he wrote that cities, businesses and individuals will continue to reduce emissions because it also serves their own interests, at the same time bowing to the influence of China, which itself has said it will move forward on climate policies without the US if necessary. Bloomberg‚Äôs article backs the position of several American mayors who have stated that their cities will defy any adverse policies introduced by Trump on critical issues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This answer is based on the given facts, which state that fish possess a circulatory system with a two-chambered heart, and each side of the heart is divided into two chambers. This circulatory system structure allows fish to effectively transport nutrients, oxygen, and other essential substances throughout their bodies. The divided heart in fish consists of an atrium and a ventricle. The atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the veins and pumps it into the ventricle. The ventricle then pumps this blood to the gills, where gas exchange occurs, and oxygenated blood is returned to the body. This two-chambered divided heart plays a crucial role in maintaining fish health and survival in their aquatic environments.

Here are my steps: 1. Identify the content of the sentence: The sentence contains \\"laughs\\" followed by a double hyphen and a space. This appears to be describing the action of someone laughing, not a complete sentence with additional context. 2. Identify any tone indicators: There are no emoticons or punctuation that can provide hints about the tone besides the double hyphen, which is often used to indicate an interruption or a pause in a sentence. However, the part before the hyphen describes laughter, which usually conveys positive emotions or amusement. 3. Consider potential context: Since there's limited information, I will make an educated guess based on the typical context of laughter. Generally, laughter is associated with happiness, joy, or amusement, so it's likely that the sentiment is positive. However, it is also possible for laughter to be a response to embarrassment, nervousness, or even maliciousness. Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact sentiment, but it's more likely to be positive than negative. Based on these steps, the sentiment of this sentence is likely perceived as positive due to the presence of laughter, although the exact emotion relies on additional context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - The Stooges, also known as Iggy and the Stooges, were an American rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1967 by singer Iggy Pop, guitarist Ron Asheton, drummer Scott Asheton, and bassist Dave Alexander. Playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll, the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by frontman Iggy Pop. After releasing two albums\\"The Stooges\\" (1969) and \\"Fun House\\" (1970)the group disbanded briefly, and reformed with a different lineup to release \\"Raw Power\\" (1973) before breaking up again in 1974. The band reunited in 2003 and was active until 2016 following the deaths of several original members. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although they initially lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, \\"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\\", they are considered one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, having initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk rock, thrash metal and alternative rock musicians. - The Big Knockover is the Swedish punk group No Fun at All 's third album , released on July 13 , 1997 .

It has a close affiliation with Californian label Epitaph Records, who own the rights to distribute Burning Heart's output in North America. It also started a German office in Berlin in the end of 2003. - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - No Fun at All (often abbreviated to just NFAA) is a Swedish punk rock band. The band formed in the summer of 1991 in Skinnskatteberg. The group initially consisted of Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar) and Jimmy Olsson (vocals, drums). The name was inspired by a tongue-in-cheek version of The Stooges' song \\"No Fun\\" as covered by the Sex Pistols, and the name of the band Sick of It All.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a comedian of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special interest-driven political climate. Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously √¢¬Ä¬ì perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills. Election Day arrives, and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says...

Meanwhile, the conductor, \\"Shack\\", makes his presence known to the other hobos hiding in the weeds with a menacing countenance. As they pull back onto the mainline, Shack spies an ambitious hobo hopping between cars and quickly makes him pay his fare by knocking him down between the rails to his death.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -46*n = -189*n - 92*n - 5170 for n.","completion":"Alright, let me explain this math problem to you like a story. Imagine you have 46 apples with a minus sign (-46), and we want to find out how many times we should multiply these apples with a number (n) to get the same amount of apples in other baskets. Now, we have 3 baskets. The first basket has 189 apples with a minus sign (-189), the second basket has 92 apples with a minus sign (-92), and the third basket has just 5170 apples with a minus sign (-5170). Each of these first two baskets is also multiplied by the same number (n) as our -46 apples basket. Let's find out how to get the same apples in every basket! Here is what the math problem looks like: -46 * n = -189 * n - 92 * n - 5170 First, let's combine the apples in the first two baskets on the right side. If we add -189 apples * n and -92 apples * n, we would have -281 apples * n. Now, the math problem looks like this: -46 * n = -281 * n - 5170 Let's move all the apples to one side so we can see how much n is. We can do this by adding 281 * n to both sides of the problem. On the left side, -46 * n + 281 * n gives us 235 * n. On the right side, -281 * n + 281 * n gives us 0, and we still have -5170 apples. So our new math problem is: 235 * n = -5170 Now, we just need to find out what n is. To do that, we can divide both sides of the problem by 235. This gives us: n = -5170 / 235 Now, if we do this calculation, we find that: n = -22 So, the number we need to multiply the apples with (-46 apples) to have the same apples in all baskets is -22! And that's the solution to our math problem!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The organization is involved in various illegal activities, including drug trafficking, extortion, and murder. The story begins with Jack entering deep into the underworld, trying to gain trust and favor within Demarkov's inner circle through his skills and charm. Simultaneously, Jack's older brother, Dave (played by Tom Hardy), is also a detective, and they share a bond that has helped both of them navigate their careers and personal lives gracefully. Dave is assigned to work with a team to find and apprehend Demarkov through legal channels but is unaware that Jack is undercover. Act 2: As Jack learns more about the organization and discovers the true extent of Demarkov's wickedness, his actions become increasingly desperate. Jack starts putting himself at risk to sabotage the group's operations and protect innocent people caught in the crossfire. His reckless behavior earns him Demarkov's trust, who starts grooming him to become his right-hand man. On the other side, Dave's relentless pursuit of Demarkov leads him one step closer to the truth about his brother's mission. As Demarkov plans his most significant and dangerous criminal heist, the tension between Jack and Dave starts to change their relationship. Jack expresses concern that Dave is too obsessed with catching Demarkov and might be in over his head. Act 3: The police, led by Chief Miller (played by Angela Bassett), realize that they need to act fast to dismantle Demarkov's empire before he carries out his next ruthless act. They devise a plan to bring Jack and Demarkov face to face in a potentially explosive confrontation, hoping this will provide enough evidence to arrest Demarkov and disband the criminal organization. Chief Miller decides to inform Dave about Jack's secret mission and motives, putting them at odds. Jack is worried Dave's involvement might compromise his cover, while Dave feels betrayed that Jack hid the truth from him. Despite the tension, the brothers put aside their differences and come together for the city by using their shared knowledge and skillsets to bring Demarkov down. The Confrontation: The police stage a fake drug deal involving a mole planted within Demarkov's organization. During the exchange, the police intervene, capturing the mole and crucial evidence related to Demarkov's crimes. The unexpected betrayal enrages Demarkov, who believes that Jack, now his trusted right-hand man, should have prevented this. Demarkov sets up a meeting with Jack to confront him. Unknown to Demarkov, the police surround the location, with Dave and a small team hidden nearby. Demarkov accuses Jack of betrayal, and their heated exchange reveals Jack's true identity. Just as Demarkov is about to kill Jack, Dave intervenes, and an intense standoff between Demarkov's gang and police ensues. The Final Battle: Amidst the chaos, Jack and Dave work together fearlessly, taking out Demarkov's henchmen. The brothers finally corner Demarkov, who refuses to surrender. In the end, a fierce shootout between Demarkov and the brothers takes place, resulting in Demarkov's ultimate defeat. Epilogue: With Demarkov apprehended and his criminal empire dismantled, Jack's undercover mission is considered a success, and he is hailed as a hero. Dave ultimately comes to terms with Jack's secret, understanding that his brother's actions were necessary for the greater good.

Coral reefs are the planet's most diverse marine ecosystem , known as the rainforests of the oceans.Despite taking up under 0.2% of the ocean floor, they provide food and shelter for almost a third of all sea life.If we lose the ecosystems, we lose not only the biodiversity , but we also lose the capability of people to obtain income and food from coral reefs. Climatic instability, which leads to rising sea temperatures, causes corals to bleach.Bleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise and this causes the coral tissue to expel their symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae - these are what give the coral their colour.Bleached corals often die if the stress continues.Among...

Summarize this article: The first happened at 06:40 at Gilmerton Newsagents on Drum Street. One of the men stayed with a motorbike while the other two held up the shop with a bladed weapon before leaving with a three-figure sum. Meanwhile, three men on a motorbike stole cigarettes at knifepoint from a Esso petrol station on the A702 Biggar Road, Hillend, at about 07:50. As before, one man stayed with the bike while the other two entered the premises. They were wearing hoodies and scarves over their faces and spoke with local accents. The men in the first robbery were last seen turning into Ferniehall Drive and then onto Old Dalkeith Road heading in the direction of Sheriffhall. A major investigation is now underway involving specialist police units including air support and dog handlers. Police are appealing for help from the public. Det Insp Steven Bertram, of Police Scotland, said: \\"We believe both incidents are linked and, due to the brazen nature in which they were carried out, officers are eager to arrest all three men and ensure they are brought to justice. \\"Traffic in this area of the city would be building up around the time of these offences and I am sure the sight of three men travelling at speed on a motorbike would have caught the attention of passing motorists. Summary:","completion":"A robbery happened at a store called Gilmerton Newsagents. Two men went inside with a sharp thing while the third man stayed outside with their motorbike.

Article: Rivers are one of our most important natural resources . Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important role in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of the history, people have used rivers for transportation . The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Gangs is great, but it is also important for transportation; Ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeast Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil. It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it. Besides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops , and chances for fun and entertainment for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase the supply of crops, engineers sometimes build a dam across a river and let a lake from behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of this natural resource. Question: The best title of the passage is _ .

His favorite color is blue and it looks amazing reflected on the ceiling. It's also very peaceful and almost magical! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review undoubtedly depicts the product in a flattering light. The writer shares their positive experiences with the turtle they purchased for their 15-month-old child, emphasizing how both of their children have enjoyed using it. The 7-year-old finds comfort in the turtle's star and moon projections and has made it a part of their nightly routine, which highlights its appeal to children in various age groups. Additionally, the writer praises the blue color projection, describing it as \\"amazing\\" and adding a sense of wonder to the product. Another significant aspect that the writer finds enchanting about the turtle is the peaceful and almost magical atmosphere it creates, further enhancing the positive image of the product. While the turtle was initially bought to encourage the younger child to sleep in their own room, the fact that it hasn't yet fulfilled that purpose does not diminish the overall favorable impression given in the review. Instead, it demonstrates the versatility and charm of the product as it also caters to the older sibling's nighttime routine. In conclusion, the product review presents the turtle in a highly positive manner. The detailed account of its features and the benefits it has brought to the writer's children showcase its appeal to a wide range of ages. The sense of wonder, comfort, and peace that the product brings to their bedtime ritual, as well as the praise for its design and color, all contribute to this review's flattering portrayal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: show off for Casey B: fight back against Casey C: take self defense lessons Answer:","completion":"B: fight back against Casey The question seeks an explanation for Kai's actions in breaking Casey's arm. According to the context provided, Casey assumed that attacking Kai would be an easy task. This assumption could stem from either underestimating Kai's abilities or overestimating their own. However, it is clear that Casey initiated the intention to attack and did not anticipate the outcome that followed. When Kai broke Casey's arm, it was in direct response to the attempted attack. This action communicates that Kai felt the need to protect themselves, assert their boundaries, and prevent potential harm, all of which align with the notion of fighting back against Casey's aggression. Answer A, showing off for Casey, would not be the best choice given the context‚ÄîKai's behavior is not in a showing-off or attention-seeking manner, but rather a defensive one. Answer C, taking self-defense lessons, is a less relevant answer, as it does not provide any insight or link to the scenario presented.

The Serpentine Sackler Gallery: 'A wedding marquee battling a stiff breeze' Kensington Gardens is no stranger to the white pointed peaks of temporary tents, every year seeing elaborate marquees poke above the trees for summer events. But now the west London park has the deluxe marquee to end all marquees: the rippling rooftop of the ¬£14.5m Serpentine Sackler Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid, which opens to the public on Saturday. Dipping and diving in sinuous waves, the white canopy is a new permanent extension to the Royal Park's Magazine, a former 1805 gunpowder store, five minutes' walk from the existing Serpentine Gallery on the north side of the Serpentine Bridge. It does what marquees usually do, housing the catering facilities for the new gallery space ‚Äì only here, tea and biscuits are supplanted by a 120-seat restaurant as souped-up as the architecture, which will be run by German celebrity sushi chef Oliver Lange. Like a wedding marquee battling with a stiff breeze, the structure billows and eddies, swooping down to meet the ground at three points along its perimeter, before shooting up again in improbable gymnastic leaps. It is not quite clear what function all this overwrought writhing serves. \\"It is one of the most complicated structures we have worked on in the office,\\" says project architect Fabian Hecker, describing the lengthy process of \\"form finding\\" with three sets of engineers to \\"push the limits of what the material can do\\". Hadid, a long-serving trustee of the Serpentine, designed the first of the gallery's annual temporary pavilions in 2000, and was again hired to build a canopy of PVC mushrooms in 2007. The Sackler building continues her ongoing pursuit of tensile structures, this time made of PTFE-coated glass fibre fabric (as used for the Millennium Dome), stretched between a twisting roller-coaster steel frame. Its edge is clad with a clunky fibreglass trim that juts out sharply like the peak of an Ascot hat, looming clumsily over the fine Georgian brickwork of the Magazine. Designing a building where the roof meets the floor in one continuous surface means you see things that would otherwise be hidden ‚Äì the unfortunate result here being an edge of crumpled fabric, stuffed unceremoniously behind the gutter. It has the crudeness expected of the gallery's summer pavilion, not a multi-million pound permanent home. Entering the building feels like being swept under the voluminous swirling petticoats of a Toulouse-Lautrec dancer, although the lightness you would imagine from a floaty tent is strangely absent. Instead, the opaque roof feels heavy and smothering, hanging low over the curved glass wall that runs around the edge of the space, so you can't really see the surrounding park at all. The ceiling is held aloft on five soaring steel columns that puncture the open-plan room like great urinals, each rising to an ovular opening that funnels light down their concave shafts. Dotted with a kitchen pod and cantilevered bar in wipe-clean whiteness, the whole place has the look of a space-age sanitary wares showroom, a slightly naff prelude to what lies beyond. The understated star of the show is the gunpowder store itself, open to the public for the first time in the building's 208-year history, now converted into a series of gallery spaces with the help of conservation architect Liam O'Connor. Most recently used to store the Mall's flagpoles, the building is what Hecker describes as a \\"house within a house,\\" the 1805 store enclosed by outer walls in the 1860s, with a Palladian portico added on the front in the 1920s. Subtle acts of surgery have now stitched the pieces together, forming a layered sequence that echoes the classical form of the existing Serpentine Gallery across the lake. A top-lit ambulatory gallery wraps around the central store, lined with plasterboard walls, providing a jacket to the inner sanctum of the two brick barrel-vaulted gunpowder chambers, dimly-lit and grotto-like spaces left raw, with exposed beams overhead. A northern wing of services and staff offices has also been added to the building, in the same Georgian dress as the original. Not that much of this can be seen for now, as the artist of the opening show, Argentinian Adri√°n Villar Rojas, has shrouded the interior with a brilliant installation that transforms the space with a new sculpted facade. Featuring cracked clay walls and a floor of loose-laid bricks, the piece has an earthy quality that engages with the building's own history and materiality, throwing into relief the starched white prissiness of what stands next door. It also includes a gigantic clay elephant charging head-first at the crumbling building ‚Äì an apt metaphor, perhaps, for the architect's approach.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - Castleman disease, also known as giant lymph node hyperplasia, lymphoid hamartoma, or angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, is a group of uncommon lymphoproliferative disorders that share common lymph node histological features that may be localized to a single lymph node (unicentric) or occur systemically (multicentric). It is named after Benjamin Castleman. - Rhadinovirus (also known as \\"Rhadinoviridae\\" and gamma-2 herpesviruses) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. Human and mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently nine species in this genus including the type species Saimiriine herpesvirus 2. Diseases associated with this genus include: Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease, caused by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The term rhadino comes from the Latin fragile, referring to the tendency of the viral genome to break apart when it is isolated. - Neonatal conjunctivitis, also known as ophthalmia neonatorum, is a form of conjunctivitis and a type of neonatal infection contracted by newborns during delivery. The baby's eyes are contaminated during passage through the birth canal from a mother infected with either \\"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\" or \\"Chlamydia trachomatis\\". Antibiotic ointment is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prevention against gonococcal ophthalmia. Most hospitals in the United States are required by state law to apply eye drops or ointment soon after birth to prevent the disease. If left untreated it can cause blindness. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses that cause diseases in animals, including humans. The members of this family are also known as herpesviruses. The family name is derived from the Greek word \\"herpein\\" (\\"to creep\\"), referring to the latent, recurring infections typical of this group of viruses. \\"Herpesviridae\\" can cause latent or lytic infections. - A DNA virus is a virus that has DNA as its genetic material and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The nucleic acid is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either \\"Group I\\" or \\"Group II\\" of the Baltimore classification system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although \\"Group VII\\" viruses such as hepatitis B contain a DNA genome, they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather reverse transcribing viruses because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like smallpox, herpes, and chickenpox are caused by such DNA viruses. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Gammaherpesvirinae is a subfamily of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae. Viruses in \\"Gammaherpesvirinae\\" are distinguished by reproducing at a more variable rate than other subfamilies of Herpesviridae. Mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently 32 species in this subfamily, divided among 4 genera. Diseases associated with this subfamily include: HHV-4: infectious mononucleosis. HHV-8: kaposi's sarcoma. - Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelid. It makes the eye appear pink or reddish. There may also be pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness. The affected eye may have increased tears or be \\"stuck shut\\" in the morning. Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur. Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies. Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes. The most common infectious causes are viral followed by bacterial. The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold. Viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people. Allergies to pollen or animal hair is also a common cause. Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally a sample of the discharge is sent for culture. Prevention is partly by handwashing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. In the majority of viral cases, there is no specific treatment. Most cases due to a bacterial infection will also resolve without treatment; however, antibiotics can shorten the illness. Those who wear contact lens and those with either gonorrhea or chlamydia as the cause should be treated. Allergic cases can be treated with antihistamine or mast cell inhibitor drops. About 3 to 6 million people get conjunctivitis each year in the United States. In adults viral causes are more common, while in children bacterial causes are more common. Typically people get better in one or two weeks. If there is visual loss, significant pain, sensitivity to light, signs of herpes, or a person is not improving after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required. Conjunctivitis in a newborn, known as neonatal conjunctivitis, may also require specific treatment. - The Herpesvirales is an order of viruses all sharing the same overall morphology. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Equine herpesvirus 2 ( EHV - 2 ) is a virus of the family Herpesviridae , originally known as equine cytomegalovirus due to its slow replication in tissue culture . However , complete sequencing of the EHV - 2 genome has demonstrated that it is a member of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae , in the genus Rhadinovirus . . It has an uncertain role in respiratory disease in horses , but EHV - 2 has been isolated from cases exhibiting symptoms such as coughing , conjunctivitis , and swollen submaxillary and parotid lymph nodes . - A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.

PUBLISHED:. 03:55 EST, 22 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 09:04 EST, 22 November 2012. With just over a month to go until Christmas people are beginning to get in the festive spirit. But while the Christmas lights may be switched on and shopping underway for most people, new research reveals that a staggering 6.7 million consumers will leave buying Christmas presents until Christmas Eve. And it appears that last minute present shopping won‚Äôt be the only festive faux pas made this year. Millions of Brits now leave their Christmas shopping to the last minute, some even have to recycle old gifts. The latest study found that nearly a quarter of Brits claim to have bought Christmas presents and later forgotten where they hid them, with women nearly twice as likely to misplace festive gifts around the house. And it seems we‚Äôre a bunch selfish shoppers with one in five of us claiming to have kept a present for ourselves, despite it being intended for someone else. Similarly one in seven have gone Christmas shopping and only bought gifts for themselves. Men are the worst offenders, with one in five claiming not to buy presents until Christmas Eve, compared to just one in ten 10 women. Men are the worst offenders when it comes to last minute shopping, with one in five claiming not to buy presents until Christmas Eve, compared to just one in ten 10 women. In addition, one in ten have bought last-minute gifts from petrol stations on their way to see loved ones, while one in ten have even wrapped up something used that they already own and given it as a present. Duncan Jennings, co-founder of VoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'There‚Äôs a lot to organise at Christmas but there‚Äôs no excuse for buying presents at a petrol station. 'With most retailers offering multiple ways to shop, online, in-store or even through a smartphone, picking up a gift has never been easier. 'Shoppers should consider writing a list of gifts they need to buy before they get started to keep them on track and help them avoid hefty last-minute delivery costs. 'We also tend to see huge discounts appearing in the lead up to Christmas, so getting organised and buying presents early will not only help consumers reduce seasonal stress, but can also save them a heap of cash.' Forgetting where you‚Äôve hidden the presents (24 per cent) Buying a present for someone else and keeping it for yourself (22 per cent) Going Christmas shopping and only buying for yourself (16 per cent) Leaving all of your shopping until Christmas Eve (15 per cent) Wrapping up something used from home to give as a present (10 per cent) Highlights:","completion":"1. A significant number of consumers, estimated at around 6.7 million, will leave their Christmas shopping until Christmas Eve, leading to last-minute purchasing and various festive mishaps. 2. One-quarter of Brits admit to having forgotten where they hid their Christmas presents, with women being nearly twice as likely to misplace gifts in their homes. 3. Selfish shopping behavior is quite common, as one in five people have kept a present intended for someone else, while one in seven have dedicated their Christmas shopping exclusively to themselves. 4.

Answer the question: Compared to an undeveloped patch of Yellowstone national park, would the city of Detroit, which is a highly developed industrial city, consume fewer natural resources? or more natural resources? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go step-by-step through the factors involved: Step 1: Analyzing the context of the question: - Yellowstone national park is a large, mostly undeveloped natural area that consumes relatively few resources for human activities. - Detroit is a highly developed industrial city, which requires significant resources for its various economic and industrial activities. Step 2: Identifying resource consumption in each area - An undeveloped patch of Yellowstone national park: -- Minimal human activity and infrastructure development -- Ecosystem sustains itself with natural processes, consuming few resources exogenously - The city of Detroit: -- High levels of human activity and infrastructure development, like housing, transport, and industries -- Industrial activities consume resources for production and large amounts of energy, leading to higher demand for natural resources Step 3: Comparing the resource consumption of both areas - Considering the factors listed in step 2, it is clear that the undeveloped patch of Yellowstone national park has a much lower consumption of natural resources compared to the highly developed industrial city of Detroit.

Options are: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no.","completion":"[III] no. The premise \\"A group of people surround a tree as someone places dirt to bury the roots.\\" presents a scenario where people are gathered around a tree, seemingly showing care and nurturing behavior by burying or replanting its roots. This suggests that they have a positive or protective attitude towards the tree. They might be planting a new tree or taking care of an existing one by ensuring its roots are properly covered with soil for better growth and stability. On the other hand, the statement \\"People chopping down a tree.\\" depicts an opposite scenario, where people are taking an action that could lead to the destruction or removal of the tree. Chopping down a tree usually involves cutting through its trunk, compromising its structural integrity and ultimately causing it to fall or be removed. This action is usually performed when a tree needs to be eliminated due to various reasons such as disease, danger, improper location, or harvesting its wood. These two scenarios are incompatible with one another. The first scenario shows people taking care of a tree by burying its roots while the second scenario has people destroying or damaging a tree by cutting it down. The actions and intentions behind both situations are contradictory, making it impossible for the premise to be true if the statement \\"People chopping down a tree.\\" is occurring. Therefore, the correct answer is [III] no, since the premise does not hold true in the context of people chopping down a tree."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The app has so much to offer - from its seamless user interface to its secure and robust messaging capabilities. Nonetheless, perfection requires dedication to constant growth, and while I give Telegram four stars, it's not without its quirks. Firstly, the app deserves appreciation for its impressive security measures. Utilizing end-to-end encryption, Telegram ensures that my messages and voice calls remain confidential. As a privacy-conscious individual, this is of utmost importance to me. I also appreciate that Telegram allows users to set self-destruct timers on messages, further enhancing the app's security feature-set. Secondly, the ability to create channels and groups with a large number of members is a major selling point for this app. I've witnessed first-hand how seamlessly Telegram handles communities of thousands of people, making it easier to disseminate information or coordinate group activities. Adding to the convenience, Telegram's cross-platform synchronization ensures that I can access my messages from multiple devices without issues. Moreover, the file-sharing feature is commendable. The 2 GB limit per file and compatibility with various file formats make it easy to share important documents and media among friends and colleagues. Consequently, it has eliminated the need to use third-party solutions for file sharing, and keeping everything under one platform has streamlined my communication needs immensely. The app, however, could improve in a few areas. For instance, the search functionality within chats can be cumbersome, making it difficult to locate a specific message or media file. As the platform continues to grow, refining the search feature will become increasingly important for users. Another room for improvement lies with video call quality. In comparison to other mainstream messaging apps, Telegram's video calls can be unstable at times, with seemingly random lags in audio and video. This is an area where the developers could focus their energy on optimization and stability, ensuring that this popular feature doesn't take a backseat in quality. Lastly, I believe adding the ability to customize fonts, chat backgrounds, and other visual aspects of the app could benefit user experience. While Telegram's current aesthetics are visually appealing, they could allow users more freedom in personalization. In conclusion, Telegram Messenger (org.telegram.messenger) is an excellent messaging app that excels in many areas, most notably security, group management, and file sharing. While there are a few aspects that could use improvements, such as search functionality, video call quality, and customization options, Telegram is well on its way to becoming the perfect messaging app. For now, I confidently give it 4 stars, knowing that with continued innovation in the face of its few shortcomings, Telegram is an app that users will continue to turn to for their communication needs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead of reaching for the roll of paper towels, use a hand dryer to save trees and water. To replace the paper towels that we discard on a daily basis, 51,000 trees have to be cut down every day. To produce one ton of paper towels, 17 trees are cut down and 20,000 gallons of water are required. Using hand dryers as opposed to paper towels cuts down significantly on waste. On a global scale, our discarded paper towels result in an estimated 254 million tons of trash every year. In the United States we consume over 13 billion pounds of paper towels every year. While thoroughly washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of germs, drying your hands also decreases the spread of bacteria. According to the CDC, germs are more easily transferred to and from wet hands. If you wash your hands and do not dry them, you usually end up with water stains all over your clothes. Use a hand dryer to prevent this from happening. While hand dryers can help reduce your carbon footprint, they still have an environmental impact. They require electricity to run, and thereby play a role in carbon dioxide emissions. Drying your hands with the typical 2,200 watt warm air-dryer three times a day for one year produces 26.61 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. To evaluate the carbon footprint of using hand dryers, also think about how your local electric company generates electricity. The more coal it uses, the more carbon the dryer produces. Researchers have concluded that paper towels are the more hygienic and sanitary choice. Here are some of the main reasons why hand dryers are less effective at decreasing the spread of germs: Dryers in public places are rarely cleaned. People often stick their hands in the dryers or on the rim, leaving bacteria on the surface. The dryers can blow bacteria onto other surfaces and onto people using them. In a study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, researchers determined that jet dryers left 4.5 times more bacteria in the vicinity than warm-air dryers, and 27 times more bacteria than paper towels. Other researchers, however, have questioned the methods employed in the study. Summary:","completion":"Using hand dryers instead of paper towels can help save trees and water, reduce waste, and potentially minimize bacteria transfer, though their environmental impact varies depending on the electricity source and hygiene concerns due to the spread of bacteria from unclean or high-powered dryers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His father, P√°draig √ì Snodaigh, was a publisher and author who worked primarily in the Irish language, contributing to the preservation and promotion of native Irish culture and language. His mother, Cliodhna Cussen, was an artist, which shows a source of creativity in the family. He received his education at Scoil Lorc√°in and Col√°iste Eoin, which are both Irish-medium schools. This reveals his deep immersion in Irish culture and history since his school-years.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders? The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims ‚Äì three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi....

Article: Trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis, Spain is considering moving the country's clock back by one hour. Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. \\"The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,\\" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.\\"This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.\\" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet. Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic... Question: Which of the following is the best title for the passage? Options: A: Lifestyle changes in Spain B: Time for Spain to turn back C: Spain's time zone issues D: Spain's work hour regulation Answer:","completion":"B: Time for Spain to turn back This title best represents the passage because it captures the main topic of discussion: Spain's consideration to move the country's clock back by one hour. This decision is presented in the context of efforts to recover from an economic crisis and to address various socio-economic issues. These issues range from productivity and absenteeism to stress, accidents, and school dropout rates, which lawmakers believe are linked to Spain's non-alignment with its geographically corresponding time zone for over 71 years. The tile \\"Time for Spain to turn back\\" effectively encapsulates these themes, suggesting both the simple act of adjusting the clock and the broader societal changes and improvements that this could facilitate. Other options like \\"Lifestyle changes in Spain,\\" while they touch upon relevant aspects such as meal times and the traditional late-morning break, do not capture the essence of the article as effectively. \\"Spain's time zone issues\\" is on the right track but may be too narrow in scope, since the article also addresses economic and societal issues, rather than just the matter of time zone alignment. \\"Spain's work hour regulation\\" also fails to encompass all the themes addressed in the article, most notably the proposal to shift the country's time.

The episode, which first aired on March 17, was removed from Fox.com and Hulu.com and the network has no plans air it again, Fox spokeswoman Gaude Paez said Tuesday. The episode features the show's main character, Peter Griffin, unwittingly befriending a terrorist who is planning to blow up a bridge and then accidentally detonating two bombs using a cell phone the friend gave him. The sounds of screams follow the detonations. Pulled: Fox will not re-air an episode of the adult cartoon 'Family Guy' that depicts mass deaths at the Boston Marathon. In a separate and unrelated scene, the episode depicts Griffin reminiscing about how he won a former Boston Marathon by mowing over runners in his car. 'I'll tell ya, Bob, I just got in my car and drove it,' Griffin says. 'And when there was a guy in my way, I killed him.' As he talks, he is illustrated driving his car across the finish line with a trail of bloody carnage behind him. Internet users mashed the clips together and suggested that the 'Family Guy' episode had either predicted or influenced the tragic explosions at the marathon on Monday that killed three people and injured 183.

Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue.

Krystin Lisaius described the child as ‚Äúragdoll-like,‚Äù according to the police report from the Oro Valley Police Department.While at the Oro Valley Hospital, the Lisaiuses refused to allow hospital staff to perform a blood draw on their child. Sometime later, the parents left with the child against medical advice, but agreed to have her transferred to Banner University Medical Center for further evaluation. The child was transported to Diamond Children‚Äôs Hospital via a Golder Ranch Fire District ambulance around 1 p.m.While at Banner, the parents were once again uncooperative and did not allow a toxicology screen on the child.After previously denying the use of cocaine, Krystin Lisaius admitted to using the drug by ‚Äúsnorting it‚Äù through her nose with Somchai Lisaius and a friend named \\"Thomas\\" on Saturday, May 14 while at their family home after hosting a barbecue earlier in the day. She also told a UMC social worker she had been breastfeeding the child. She stated that she didn‚Äôt think the baby would be affected after 12 hours had passed. She also refused all lab tests on the child except a heel blood stick, body scans and physical exams.In the presence of representatives of the Office of Child Welfare Investigations and Department of Child Safety, Banner UMC staff conducted a urinalysis as well as a toxicology screen that showed the presence of cocaine in the child‚Äôs system. An OVPD officer performed a blood draw analysis on Krystin Lisaius after obtaining a search warrant.OVPD detectives interviewed the couple, who both admitted to recent cocaine usage at their home and said that there was cocaine present at their home.Thomas, who is also the child‚Äôs godfather, was interviewed by OVPD and said he was ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù with the couple and was at the Lisaius‚Äô home on that night for a party.According to the police report, Thomas stated, ‚ÄúI saw her (Krystin Lisaius) do one line, tops.‚Äù He also stated that he ingested cocaine with Somchai Lisaius through a rolled-up receipt from a bathroom countertop.During the course of investigation, Somchai Lisaius told OVPD detectives that on the same evening, he and his wife hosted a barbecue at their home for a birthday celebration, including family and friends. Somchai Lisaius eventually admitted that he used cocaine that night, having initially denied the act, and that he used the drug ‚Äúevery six weeks or so.‚Äù He also said that he has witnessed his wife using cocaine since having their child.Somchai Lisaius turned over a key to the residence to authorities for the purpose of searching the house. He also told the officers that there was cocaine in the home and where to find it. A voluntary search of his black, four-door BMW yielded no results.On May 16 at approximately 8:40 p.m., OVPD detectives served a search warrant on the Lisaius residence, at which they located ‚Äúone clear baggie‚Äù containing a white powdery substance, a Hilton Hotel honor‚Äôs card belonging to Krystin Lisaius with white residue on it, several baggies of assorted sizes and a small black digital scale.All together, nearly 2 grams of cocaine was found in the residence.On June 1, the urinalysis and lab test results from Krystin Lisaius came back positive for the presence of cocaine, though a hair test came up negative. According to the police report, the hair report only came back negative because of ‚ÄúMs. Lisaius having bleached hair.‚Äù Somchai Lisaius‚Äôs hair and urine tested positive for cocaine. The baby‚Äôs results for hair tested positive for cocaine.Somchai Lisaius first joined the Tucson reporting scene in 2000 after having worked in Michigan and attending Alma College for a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English and Boston University for a master‚Äôs degree in broadcast journalism.Krystin Lisaius attended Pima Community College before receiving a bachelor‚Äôs degree in broadcast journalism and met her husband when she was brought on as an intern into the KOLD newsroom in 2012.During the course of the investigation at the hospital, the child‚Äôs medical status was deemed ‚Äúgood‚Äù and is expected to make a full recovery.On Monday, June 27, Somchai and Krystin Lisaius both pleaded not guilty to possession of a dangerous drug, drug paraphernalia and child abuse after being indicted on June 9. The child is in the custody of the Department of Child Safety.According to KOLD-TV, Somchai Lisaius was terminated from employment.While speaking to thelocal attorney Michael Piccarreta, who is representing the Lisaiuses in court, called the whole thing an ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù and ‚Äúisolated‚Äù incident that would never happen again.‚ÄúFortunately,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhen you get to the underlying facts, the facts are that these are excellent parents. The child is well taken care of, the child was never harmed and is responding beautifully. ||||| Arizona TV Reporters Indicted For Child Abuse After Cocaine Found in Their 4-Month-Old's System Two former local TV personalities have been indicted in Arizona for child abuse after their 4-month-old baby was found with cocaine in its system, authorities tell PEOPLE.A public information officer for the Oro Valley Police Department says Krystin Rae Lisaius and Somchai P. Lisaius ‚Äì both news personalities in the Tucson area ‚Äì were indicted June 9 on three felony charges: possession of a dangerous drug, drug paraphernalia and child abuse.Both pleaded not guilty in court on Monday, and were released on their own recognizance.\\"It would be a gross, gross injustice [with] even the mention of prison time,\\" the Lisaius' lawyer, Michael Piccarreta, told Tucson News Now . \\"I anticipate they will demonstrate that they have learned a very hard, embarrassing lesson and that this will become a footnote in their life, not a chapter.\\"(PEOPLE was not immediately able to reach Piccarreta for comment.)Police said they were alerted after the couple brought the baby, who was showing signs of distress and appeared lethargic, to the Oro Valley Hospital on May 15. The couple allegedly refused to allow a blood test on the baby, who was then transferred to Diamond Children's Center at the Banner University Medical Center in Tucson by ambulance, police said.At Banner, a urine test was conducted after the parents again allegedly refused a blood test, police said. Toxicology results showed the presence of cocaine.Krystin, 26, later allegedly admitted to Oro Valley authorities that she ingested cocaine after a party at the couple's home, police said. She allegedly said she breastfed the child 12 hours later.A friend identified only as \\"Thomas\\" told police that he allegedly watched Krystin \\"snort\\" the drug from the home's master bathroom countertop after the party.Thomas said he and Somchai, 42, allegedly also used cocaine during the evening. Police said Somchai allegedly confirmed the recent drug use, and, in a police report obtained by Tucson News Now, said he used cocaine every six weeks or so.A search of the couple's home produced multiple samples of drug paraphernalia, police said. Two small bags containing a white powder substance found at the residence tested positive for cocaine, they said.Somchai is a former reporter at Tucson News Now, the station confirmed , and Krystin previously worked for nearby KGUN 9. Krystin also competed in 2013 for the title of Miss Arizona USA, according to the pageant's website The baby was released from Banner Hospital within a few days of being admitted, and was placed with the maternal grandmother. The Department of Child Services is continuing to monitor the child's welfare, police told PEOPLE.Krystin was granted 24-7 contact with the baby, and Somchai is allowed to see the child for 12 hours a day, according to KAUZ 6 \\"Hypothetically,\\" Piccarreta said, \\"if the child ingested cocaine through breast milk, then you gotta realize that there's different understanding as to when a recreational drug will be out of your system.\\"And if there's a misjudgment as to how fast it's out of your system, then it's an error that has been learned. It won't be repeated.\\" ||||| An Oro Valley couple has been indicted after their 4-month-old baby tested positive for cocaine. Krystin Rae Lisaius, 26, a former reporter at KGUN 9, and Somchai P.

But lawmakers remain split on passing a measure to overhaul former President Barack Obama's signature health law. Mr Trump vowed to repeal the law, known as Obamacare, during his 2016 campaign. Arizona Senator John McCain told CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday that he believes the Republican bill is \\"probably going to be dead\\". But the Trump administration adopted an optimistic tone. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Fox News Sunday the president expected the Senate to approve a healthcare bill either before the start of lawmakers' August recess \\"or maybe a little bit into\\" the summer break. Congress returned to Washington on Monday as a new survey highlighted the number of Americans without health insurance has grown by some two million this year, according to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index. The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, which would roll back parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and cut the tax increases that fund it, has faced mounting challenges. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced late last month lawmakers would delay a vote on the measure until after the 4 July holiday recess. Liberal groups held protests to express their frustrations over the bill while lawmakers were home for the bank holiday last week. Eight Republican senators had announced they would oppose the bill and the party can only afford to lose two votes to pass it in the upper chamber. A version of the bill passed in the House of Representatives in May after facing a similar delay. Hardline conservatives like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have said they will not support the legislation, arguing the measure does not go far enough to dismantle the law, while moderate Republicans say the bill will harm some of their vulnerable constituents. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. The 142-page Senate draft phases out the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for low-income Americans, and imposes deep cuts to the policy. The bill also gives states more latitude in requiring insurers to provide essential health benefits guaranteed under Obamacare, including emergency and maternity care and mental health services. More than 20 million people gained healthcare coverage under Obamacare. Senator Cruz has proposed an amendment that would allow health insurers to sell cheaper, basic plans as long as at least one complies with Obamacare regulations, providing a loophole to the requirement that insurance companies charge sick and healthy consumers at the same rate. Mr Cruz and other conservatives argue it will help lower premiums for healthy Americans, but opponents say it strips protections for sick people and those with pre-existing conditions. A version of the bill with the Cruz amendment is being scored by the CBO. This article was about:","completion":"This article is about the United States Congress trying to pass a new healthcare bill.

In Edwardian London, 1910, Bert entertains a crowd as a one-man band when he senses a change in the wind. Afterwards, he directly addresses the audience, and gives them a tour of Cherry Tree Lane, stopping outside the Banks family's home. George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Instead, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny. Mr. Banks rips up the letter, and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but the remains of the advertisement magically float up, and out into the air. The next day, a number of elderly, sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks' home, but a strong gust of wind blows them away, and Jane and Michael witness a young nanny descending from the sky using her umbrella. Presenting herself to Mr. Banks, Mary Poppins calmly produces the children's restored advertisement, and agrees with its requests, but promises the astonished banker she will be firm with his children.

Question: Does Wade respect Alice? Title: 3:10 to Yuma Movie plot: A stagecoach makes its way across the scorched desert as we hear Frankie Laine sing the theme song that will be repeated in many guises throughout the film (even whistled by the villain). It's the Arizona Territory of the 1880s. The stagecoach is going from Contention City to Bisbee and is only a few miles from its destination. A group of men on horseback herd cattle to block the path of the stage. After it stops and the dust clears, we see that the men are a band of thieves, some with their guns drawn. The owner of the stage line, Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), is on board, and the target of the robbery is a gold shipment atop the stage. Small-time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two young sons, Mark (Jerry Hartleben) and Mathew (Barry Curtis), are on horseback looking for their errant cattle. Dan hears the cattle over the ridge, and they ride over to where they can see the robbery in progress. Dan waits for the dust to settle, but the robbers spot him, and their leader, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), tells him to stay where he is--he'll get his cattle back in five minutes.As one of the robbers passes down the gold, the driver, Bill Moons (Boyd Stockman), draws his own gun and grabs the man as a shield. The gang leader draws and fires off two shots--one that kills his own man to clear the line of sight and one that kills Bill Moons. Mark asks his father if he isn't going to do something, but Dan sees there's nothing he can do without getting himself shot. He recognizes the robbers as Ben Wade and his gang. Wade has words with Mr. Butterfield and instructs him to return the driver's body to Contention City where he lived. \\"Where a man lives, that's where he should be buried.\\" Wade then confiscates Dan's horses so he won't ride to the marshal. He says he'll turn them loose just this side of Bisbee. Taking the six horses from the stagecoach as well, Wade and his men depart. Dan and his boys go on foot to bring the cattle home, and Dan agrees to return with a horse for the stranded stage.At home, Dan's devoted...

Article:Jeremy Corbyn has said all his MPs will be told to approve the triggering of Article 50 because they should accept the result of last year's referendum. Lib Dem Tim Farron says generations to come will not forgive that position. The Supreme Court will announce next Tuesday whether the government needs to seek Parliament's approval. Ministers say they already have enough powers under the Royal Prerogative to go ahead with Brexit. But campaigners argue that starting Brexit in this way would be undemocratic and unconstitutional. In June's referendum, 51.9% of voters backed leaving the EU, while 48.1% supported remaining in the 28-nation group. Mr Corbyn said he did not think it was right to block Article 50 in the wake of the referendum result. \\"It's up to us to use the opportunity that's provided to stop the Tories from doing this bargain basement, low tax haven on the shores of Europe,\\" he told the BBC. \\"What I'm saying to all of my MPs is we've supported the principle of holding the referendum, the referendum was held, it delivered a result - I don't think it's right to block Article 50 negotiations. \\"It's absolutely right that we're involved in these negotiations and making the case for a fairer and socially just Britain.\\" Asked if that meant he would be imposing a three-line whip - the strongest available sanction - on Labour MPs, requiring them to back Article 50, he said: \\"It means that all Labour MPs will be asked to vote in that direction next week or whenever the vote comes up.\\" However, a senior Labour source has told the BBC between 60 and 80 of the party's MPs might be ready to defy the leadership if there is a vote in Parliament. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis said the government's current position is \\"unacceptable\\" and he wants further assurances. Another Labour MP told the BBC there would be a \\"swathe\\" of resignations from the front bench if Mr Corbyn instructed his MPs to vote for Brexit. The MP said that for colleagues in constituencies that voted strongly for Remain it would be \\"suicide\\" to back Article 50. And Labour's Mike Gapes, who has been outspoken in his criticism of Mr Corbyn in the past, told the Ilford Recorder he would not be toeing the party line. \\"I am going to vote against triggering Article 50 and let me be clear, I am going to be as loyal to Jeremy Corbyn as he was to previous Labour leaders,\\" he said. \\"I will show the same loyalty he did when he voted, 500 times, against the Labour whip under successive party leaders. The people of Britain did not vote to become poorer and I will not vote in favour of any deal that would see us leave the single market.\\" BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said nobody expected Parliament to stop Brexit being triggered, but Mr Corbyn could struggle to keep his party's position coherent, whether he insists on a three-line whip or not. Lib Dem leader Mr Farron accused Labour of \\"lamely\\" giving up against the government's drive for a hard Brexit. He said he believed Mr Corbyn had put the party on the wrong side of the biggest political issue in a generation. \\"I think what Labour has done is to believe this is too difficult for them politically, let's just wait for it to go away, and the meeker we are, the quicker it will go away,\\" he told the Guardian. \\"I think that's the calculation they've made, and this and future generations are not going to forgive them for that. \\"It's not divisive to hold the government to account, and not just to lamely give up as we go over a cliff, and that is what Labour are doing - they are being the most ineffective opposition in living memory.\\" Mr Farron added that his party, which has just nine MPs, would not consider an electoral deal with Labour because Mr Corbyn is \\"electorally toxic\\". Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas claimed Mr Corbyn was \\"trying to deny Labour MPs the chance to make their own principled choice on one of the most important decisions of the UK's recent history\\". Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK's Labour Party, has said that his members of Parliament (MPs) must approve the triggering of Article 50, which will start the process of leaving the European Union (EU). He believes that it is important to accept the result of last year's referendum where the majority of voters chose to leave the EU. However, some Labour MPs do not agree with this and may not follow Corbyn's direction.

The capacitance of certain capacitors decreases as the component ages. In ceramic capacitors, this is caused by degradation of the dielectric. The type of dielectric, ambient operating and storage temperatures are the most significant aging factors, while the operating voltage has a smaller effect. The aging process may be reversed by heating the component above the Curie point. Aging is fastest near the beginning of life of the component, and the device stabilizes over time. Electrolytic capacitors age as the electrolyte evaporates. In contrast with ceramic capacitors, this occurs towards the end of life of the component.

Sentence 2: Johannes Hiltz added the open work spire in the 15th century. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Both sentences convey the same key information, though they are phrased differently. The first sentence provides additional details about the open-work spire being graceful and that Johannes H√ºltz is from Cologne, while the second one condenses the information into a simpler form without those specific details. In the first sentence, it states that the open-work spire was added to the structure during the 15th century by Johannes H√ºltz, who is mentioned to be from Cologne. The spire is described as 'graceful,' implying that it is an aesthetically pleasing and delicately intricate addition to the building. The second sentence also mentions that Johannes Hiltz (likely an anglicized version of the name H√ºltz) was responsible for adding the open-work spire to the building, and this occurred during the 15th century. Though the second sentence does not describe the spire as 'graceful' or H√ºltz being from Cologne, the core information about the spire being added by Hiltz in the 15th century is present in both sentences. Thus, it can be concluded that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, as both statements focus on the same central point: Johannes Hiltz added the open work spire in the 15th century.

Given the below context: Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanoviƒá that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690‚Äì91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Brankoviƒá, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanoviƒá to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanoviƒá made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanoviƒá went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Panƒçevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanoviƒá's finest achievements. Guess a valid title for it!

Muna Farah is a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at White Castle. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle.

Survivors of the Khmer Rouge said playing the game at the site, which is now open to visitors, was an insult. Pokemon Go launched in several South East Asian countries last weekend. It has already been a huge success in others areas of the world. The Khmer Rouge regime, in power from 1975-1979, claimed the lives of up to two million people, one of the worst mass killings of the 20th Century. Photographs of many of the victims who were taken to Tuol Sleng in Phnom Penh - also known as S-21 - are now on display in the rooms in which they were tortured. Officials and tour guides told local media they had seen people playing inside the prison grounds. Bou Meng, 76, one of a handful of people to survive Tuol Sleng, told news agency AFP: \\"It is a place of suffering. It is not appropriate to play the game there. \\"It is an insulting act to the souls of the victims who died there.\\" He called for the museum to be excluded from the game's maps. Pokemon Go, which sees players hunting virtual monsters in the real world through phones, finally launched in 15 countries in the region last week. In Taiwan, officials say more than 1,200 people have been caught playing Pokemon while driving, leading to the National Freeway Bureau asking game creator Niantic \\"not to place any Pokemon treasures\\" on highways and rest stops. Taiwan's railway authorities have also said they would look into removing station and trains from the game.

We have a math problem to solve, and it has some big numbers. Let's find out what \\"d\\" is. Here's the problem we need to solve: 76*d + 154 - 838 = 0 First, let's combine the numbers that don't have \\"d\\" with them. So, we'll add 154 and then take away 838. 154 - 838 = -684 (because 838 is bigger than 154, we get a negative number) Now, our problem looks like this: 76*d - 684 = 0 We need to get \\"d\\" all by itself. To do that, let's add 684 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -684. 76*d - 684 + 684 = 0 + 684 This gives us: 76*d = 684 Now, we need to find out what \\"d\\" is. Since \\"d\\" is being multiplied by 76, we can find \\"d\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 76. (76*d) / 76 = 684 / 76 This will give us: d = 9 And there you have it! The answer is d = 9.

When I moved away to college, we started getting closer because there was that distance between us and we didn‚Äôt see each other every day.

I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her about how I was feeling because I felt so guilty that I couldn‚Äôt let myself grieve, and I didn‚Äôt want to have to listen to her grieve over it while dealing with that.

At 138 stories (1,800√Ç ft/550√Ç m), it is the world's tallest building. Shortly after his arrival, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door, leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings (and who is later disclosed to have died). Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation. Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze, which soon spreads out of control. SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor, directing them to express elevators. A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe.

Choose fresh, in-season asparagus that has not gone limp or woody. Avoid asparagus that is brown or discolored; it won't taste good after freezing. Chop about one inch from the ends of the asparagus. The chewy texture of the ends is unpleasant, especially after freezing, so make sure you get rid of the entire dry or woody part. In order to retain its flavor, asparagus should be blanched before freezing. This is the process of boiling the asparagus for about 30 seconds and removing it from heat before it loses its crunch. The asparagus is plunged into ice water to stop it from cooking. Boil a large pot of water and prepare a large bowl of ice water. In order for the asparagus to blanch evenly, it's best to chop it into smaller pieces. If you'd prefer to leave the stalks intact, that's fine, but the flavor may be compromised. If your spears are extra-thick, boil them for longer; if they're thin, boil them for just thirty seconds. Monitor the asparagus carefully so you don't end up overcooking it. Use a slotted spoon to immediately transfer it to the ice bath so it can cool down and stop cooking. Leave it in the ice bath for the same amount of time you boiled it, then transfer it to a colander to let it drain and dry. Lay out the pieces on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place the sheet in the freezer. Freeze the asparagus for about one hour, until each piece is slightly ice. Flash freezing the asparagus before longer-term storage will keep the pieces from freezing together into a solid mass. Put the frozen pieces into a freezer bag or a plastic freezer container. Pack it as tightly as possible in order to remove most of the air. Label the container with the date. Frozen asparagus will keep for up to a year in properly cold conditions. There's no need to thaw asparagus before cooking; just add it to soups and other dishes frozen. Summary:","completion":"To freeze asparagus, choose thick, fresh ones, and avoid brown or limp ones. Cut off the chewy ends and blanch the asparagus in boiling water for about 30 seconds to keep the flavor and crunch. Cool it in ice water, then dry it. Chop to smaller pieces, if you want. Freeze them on a baking sheet for an hour, then pack in a freezer bag or container. Label and store them for up to a year.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Use a mop and warm water to wet your tile flooring before using cleaning agents. Tile is porous and will absorb the water to prevent chemicals from penetrating the tile. You can loosen tough dirt before wetting the floor with a broom, or after the floor is wet using a plastic pot scrubber. Fill a bucket with warm water and a couple of drops of dish soap. Scrub the floor with a nylon or natural bristle brush. You can leave the cleaning solution on the floor for ten to fifteen minutes, as long as it you don‚Äôt let it dry on the tile. After scrubbing, rinse the flooring ‚Äì twice, if possible ‚Äì with plain water. Dry the flooring with terry cloth towels, if needed. If soap and water haven‚Äôt worked, try a household or commercial floor cleaner intended for ceramic tile. Find an inconspicuous area and make a small test spot with the cleaner. Use acid-based or chemical cleaner with caution, only if necessary and always following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Make sure to thoroughly pre-wet the floor first, and completely rinse it afterwards. Acid-based cleaner may be necessary to remove lime or cement mortar staining. Never use abrasive cleaners like powdered cleansing agents, baking soda or even creams advertised as ‚Äúmildly‚Äù abrasive. These can damage the tile‚Äôs surface and design. Fill a bucket with an ounce of Murphy Oil Soap, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and two gallons of warm water. Dip a toothbrush or other narrow brush into the bucket and gently scrub the grout. Avoid the tiling as much as possible. Since some contact with the tile is inevitable, perform a test first in a small area. Allow the diluted cleaner to air dry on the grout. Summary:","completion":"This article provides a comprehensive guide on cleaning tile flooring using various methods, emphasizing the importance of pre-wetting the tiles, using appropriate cleaning solutions, and following specific techniques to protect both the tile and grout, while taking necessary precautions when using acid-based or chemical cleaners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. This is vital to developing empathy. Browse some websites that talk about ADD or ADHD. Get pamphlets from a local therapist's office. You can ask your boyfriend to refer you to reading materials, as he may know great places to read up on the conditions. People with ADD/ADHD may struggle to pay attention. Your boyfriend may zone out during conversations, for example, or struggle to sit still through a movie. People with ADD/ADHD may also be forgetful. If your boyfriend got the time wrong for a dinner date, he may have been listening to you earlier. He simply forgot the information. ADD and ADHD may cause poor organizational skills, so if you clean up after your boyfriend a lot, that's not necessarily because he's being rude. He just may struggle to keep up. People with ADD and ADHD may be more emotional and impulsive. Your boyfriend may suddenly blurt things out and may have a slight temper. It may be difficult to have a calm conversation with someone with ADD or ADHD. Talking with your boyfriend and asking him questions about his experiences with ADD or ADHD can also help you to gain valuable perspective. Some questions you might ask him to get a better sense of how ADD or ADHD affects him include: What is hardest about living with ADHD? Does it ever affect your emotions? Do you take medication? If so, how does the medication make you feel? Is there anything I can do to help? This is important to understanding your boyfriend's experience. When your boyfriend is frustrating you, pause for a second and consider his perspective. It is difficult to live with ADHD or ADD day in and day out. If your boyfriend is frustrating you, imagine how frustrated he must feel at himself. For example, you're angry because your boyfriend could not get out the door in time for a movie as he kept getting distracted along the way. While this is frustrating for you, think how your boyfriend must feel. He probably feels mad at himself for letting you down, and frustrated he's unable to manage his symptoms well enough for a simple movie date. You were probably drawn to your boyfriend for a reason. He is not completely defined by his ADD/ADHD. Try to remember why you like being with him when things get frustrating. Try making a mental list of everything you like about your boyfriend. Does he always make you laugh? Is he more tolerant of your grouchiness after work? Does he do nice things for you, like bring you coffee in the morning? If you remember why you're in the relationship, this can quell any feelings of resentment you have. You will be able to feel more empathetic for someone if you remember why you value them. Resentment can build up if you do not communicate regularly. Resentment can destroy empathy, so if something's bothering you, discuss it. Never make assumptions during a conversation. You do not understand why someone behaved the way they did without asking. Do not say, \\"You just don't care, which is why you never remember to take out the garbage. It's disrespectful.\\" Instead, say, \\"Is there a reason you're having trouble remembering to take out the garbage?\\" When your boyfriend talks, listen actively. Do not interrupt. If you need clarification, wait until your boyfriend's done talking and say something like, \\"I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Could you explain more?\\" Also, remember to laugh. Miscommunications are inevitable, and facing them with good humor can help reduce tension. If you're in a relationship with someone with ADD/ADHD, a lot of this person's actions can be read the wrong way. If your boyfriend interrupts you in mid-sentence, you may think he's not interested in what you have to say. If your boyfriend is 15 minutes late to a date, you may think he does not care about your time. These are symptoms of ADD/ADHD and do not necessarily speak to your boyfriend's character. It can take a long time for symptoms to be managed properly. There will be struggles along the way. In moments of frustration, say to yourself, \\"This is his ADHD. This is not him.\\" Remember, you're with this person for a reason. If he's struggling to manage his ADHD/ADD at the moment, this is not a permanent situation. Once symptoms are more under control, you'll be able to focus more on his good qualities. Summary:","completion":"1. Research ADD/ADHD by browsing websites and reading pamphlets from local therapists to gain a better understanding of the condition. 2. Discuss the condition with your boyfriend and ask questions to understand his perspective and experiences. 3. Practice empathy by considering his struggles when dealing with the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. 4. Focus on the positive aspects of your relationship to remind yourself why you value each other. 5. Communicate openly and actively listen to each other to prevent resentment and miscommunications. 6. Remember that your boyfriend's actions related to his ADD/ADHD are a result of the condition, not a reflection of his character. 7. Be patient and supportive during the process of managing symptoms, knowing that improvement is possible."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPT: (I) Place picture hanger hooks on the bottom of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those. (II) Place picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those.","completion":"OPT (II) Place picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those makes more sense to accomplish this goal. Here is the justification for this choice: Step 1: Identify the problem - The problem is that trash bag falls inside the dust bin when it's not secured properly. Step 2: Compare both options - Consider the consequences and advantages of both options I and II. Option I: - Placing picture hanger hooks on the bottom of the can might obstruct the trash from being easily thrown into the bin. - It may also cause the trash bag to tear from the hooks due to the weight of the trash as well as the angle it's being pulled from. Option II: - Placing picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can allows for a more secure hold of the trash bag handles. - It does not obstruct the trash from being thrown into the dust bin. - It lessens the chances of the trash bag tearing, as the weight is uniformly distributed. Step 3: Determine the preferred option - From the comparison, Option II seems to be a better solution to the problem. Placing the picture hanger hooks on the outside of the dust bin allows the trash bag to be held securely without obstructing the process of throwing trash into the bin, resulting in a more practical and efficient solution. Based on these steps, Option II is the better choice in accomplishing the goal of securing the top of the trash bag to prevent it from falling into the dust bin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. ‚ÄúIf you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,‚Äù Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, ‚ÄúBuild the wall!‚Äù Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. ‚ÄúWe are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,‚Äù he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. ‚ÄúWe should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,‚Äù said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. ‚ÄúWhat country is that? This is the United States of America!‚Äù Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe‚Äôs neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. and the situation: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences.

They both learned lots of new interesting facts. Answer the following question: Which friend learned less about animals that survive in greater numbers?

This is because Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly, as opposed to Greg who focused on reading about natural selection in general. Natural selection is the process through which organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Therefore, Greg's studies would have exposed him to more information about animals that possess advantageous traits, which in turn, allowed them to survive better and in larger numbers, than their counterparts with less favorable traits. On the other hand, Frank's focus on populations where natural selection occurred less frequently means he would be more focused on situations where advantageous traits were not as predominant or did not necessarily lead to an increase in the population size of those animals.

Another conductor, Neilsen, takes the place of the absent Hollenius, and the performance is a great success.

The Washington Supreme Court is asking the Legislature to approve a 90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases, Chief Justice Gerry Alexander said Wednesday. \\"Some might say, why should we support this when we face tough financial times?\\" Alexander asked in his State of the Judiciary address to a joint session of the Legislature. \\"It seems to me in America, where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law, we should not ration access to justice.\\" The recommendation comes from the court's Task Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding, created in 2001 to look for ways to cope with the sparse amount of money available for such cases. As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges. Two of the Superior Court judges and the District Court judge would be in Clark County, with one Superior Court judge added in the joint district that serves Benton and Franklin counties and one each in Kittitas and Kitsap counties. Question: \\"What change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court?\\" Response: \\"Staff Cut\\" Options are: [A]. no [B]. yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"A. no The response does not correctly answer the question. The change that would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court is the proposed 90 surcharge on the court filing fee, not staff cuts.

Cyprus has been warned it must sell its excess gold reserves to raise 400million euros needed to help finance its EU bailout. The stark assessment by the European Commission will come as another huge blow for the tiny country as it battles to save its stricken economy. One of the euro zone's smallest economies, Cyprus has already been forced to wind down one of its largest banks and slapped losses on uninsured deposits in order to qualify for a 10billion euro lifeline from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Protests: There have been protests held across the country as fears rise over the impact of the crisis. Here employees of Cyprus Airways (pictured) demonstrate against the company's restructuring plans. Desperate: Widespread protests have been held across Cyprus as fears rise over the impact of the crisis. The country has now been told it must sell its excess gold reserves to help fund its bailout. Worried: Cypriots have queued to withdraw money from the country's banks since the financial crisis hit - including at this Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia. The European Commission's draft assessment set. out plans for the sale of some 10 tonnes of gold, the biggest euro zone bullion. sale in four years. The assessment also said that Cyprus would raise 10.6 billion euros from the winding down of Laiki Bank and the losses imposed on junior bondholders and the deposit-for-equity swap for uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus. Nicosia would get a further 600 million euros over three years from higher corporate income taxes and a rise in the capital gains tax rate. Fears: Depositors waiting to withdraw money from a branch of Laiki Bank in Nicosia, last month. Laiki, also known as Cyprus Popular Bank, was wound up as part of the bailout deal agreed with the EU. Of the total Cypriot financing needs of. 23 billion euros between the second quarter of 2013 and the first. quarter of 2016, the euro zone bailout fund will provide nine billion. euros, the International Monetary Fund one billion euros and Cyprus itself. will generate 13 billion euros, the assessment said. Cyprus's total bullion reserves stood at 13.9 tonnes at the end of February, according to data from the World Gold Council. The analysis from the EU and IMF predicts the Cypriot economy will contract by 8.7 percent this year, following the bailout designed to put Cyprus back on a stable financial footing. It also shows that the economy will go on contracting through 2014, returning to marginal growth of 1.1 per cent in 2015. At the same time, debt as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) will peak at 126 percent, before falling to 104 per cent in 2020, the debt sustainability report shows. The analysis forecasts the budget deficit to be six per cent of GDP this year, 7.9 per cent next year, 5.7 per cent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone bailout fund, also said in a proposal that the maximum average maturity of euro zone bailout loans to Cyprus will be 15 years and the longest maturity will be 20 years. Cyprus will be charged a 10-basis-point margin above financing costs for the loans, plus a 50 basis point up-front fee for every disbursement, said the proposal, which will be discussed on Friday by finance ministers of European Union countries at a meeting in Dublin. The ESM document bears the date of April 23, 2013, indicating that this will be the date when the euro zone is likely to formally sign the bailout agreement with Cyprus. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"So, this article is about a country called Cyprus that's in a bit of trouble with money. Their friends from a group called the European Union and the International Monetary Fund want to help them, but Cyprus needs to do some things first. They are told they have to sell some of their gold, and they'll have to close one of their biggest banks and take some money from people who had a lot of money in their banks. They are also going to get some extra money from raising taxes on businesses and people who sell things. People in Cyprus are worried and have been taking their money out of the banks. It might take a while for Cyprus to be doing okay again, but the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are trying to help them out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This charming seafood restaurant has a cozy, nautical ambiance, with its wooden walls adorned with ocean-themed decorations that immediately drew me in and set a relaxed tone for our meal. The food at Ocean Delights was nothing short of spectacular. We started with the Calamari Fritti, which was cooked to perfection ‚Äì crispy on the outside with tender and flavorful squid on the inside. For our entrees, we opted for the Seafood Risotto and the Grilled Mahi Mahi. Both dishes were beautifully presented and packed with an array of delightful flavors. The Seafood Risotto was richly creamy with a generous portion of fresh, perfectly cooked shrimp, scallops, and mussels. The Grilled Mahi Mahi was seasoned just right, and its flaky texture easily made it the star of our meal. The service at Ocean Delights was top-notch. Our server, Samantha, was attentive, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu. She guided us through our meal choices and her recommendations definitely enhanced our experience. While the pricing at Ocean Delights may be on the higher side, the quality of the dishes and the overall experience justifies the cost, making it absolutely worth it.

Yelp reviews took us to this restaurant and I have to say, it was a major disappointment. It began with the Waiter/Somellier who basically gave us the bums rush. We were barely seated before he decended and raced through the wine options without so much as a warm smile, introduction, welcome, or caring about the fact that my wife had been seated on the gap between two bench seats. Cutting to the end of the service, as he presented the bill he finally decided to smile and converse with us. Too late, buddy. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we decided to order multiple appetizers rather than one main course each in order to sample as much of the fair as possible...who knows. The food was ok but not stellar. The foie gras was excellent but that's the only thing that I even remember from the meal. In fact, now that I'm writing this, I really can't recall what we ate, it was that unforgettable. Of course, it could have been an off-day.

As a pilot, one of the most critical aspects of any navigation app is accuracy and reliability, and Avare excels in both. The GPS-based navigation is spot-on, and the app provides an extensive array of charts and instrument approach plates that are always up-to-date. The flight planning tools have made my pre-flight preparations a breeze, and I can't imagine flying without them now. The real-time weather information is incredibly helpful in avoiding unpleasant surprises when I am up in the air, and it has definitely made me a safer pilot. The ability to track other aircraft nearby is an excellent added feature that contributes to situational awareness during flight. The interface is intuitive, and I've found it easy to use even during high-stress situations. The performance of the app is also stable, with no noticeable lag or crashes. To sum it up, Avare has exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to all pilots and aviation enthusiasts.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which group had more organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

(CNN) -- For months, Republicans derisively doubted if U.S. President Barack Obama was a true friend of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, questioning if Americans should re-elect someone who might not be on the same page with the long-time U.S. ally. Now, it's Netanyahu facing political heat in his own country -- for his relationship with Obama. Despite sometimes blistering attacks over where his administration stands on Israel and against Iran's nuclear program, Obama this week emerged victorious in the U.S. presidential election. But Netanyahu has months to go in his own campaign, including time to answer questions about his relationship with the American leader.

Such a line of questioning, and political attacks, about U.S.-Israeli relations is nothing new -- as evidenced in the recent Israeli election. In the final weeks of Netanyahu's campaign, his opponents focused on his relationship with Obama, accusing him of putting Israel's security at risk by alienating the U.S. president. Netanyahu defended himself by insisting that Israel's bond with the United States remained strong and that, as a leader, he must make tough decisions based on Israel's best interests, regardless of public opinion abroad. As the election results rolled in, it became apparent that the Israeli voters were not swayed by the political attacks surrounding Netanyahu's relationship with Obama. The incumbent prime minister ultimately claimed victory, with his policies regarding national security and economic growth resonating with the majority of the electorate. In the aftermath of the election, both President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu acknowledged the importance of their countries' alliance and pledged to work together to address the ongoing challenges facing the region. Despite the political tensions of their respective election campaigns, they committed to a renewed focus on diplomacy and cooperation in pursuit of stable U.S.-Israeli relations and a more secure future for both nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The answer to the question: With which superhero does Grayson appear to have a negative history? is inside the article: While no cohesive plot is apparent from the vignette style of the trailer, it can be pieced together that Batman has been murdered, and his killer remains at large. Dick Grayson is long since retired from his superhero days and raising a family with to his wife Barbara Gordon. After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon. Grayson is aware of Superman's secret identity; he addresses him as \\"Clark\\". Superman apparently is also motivated (obviously from O'Hara) to discourage Grayson's return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume. Grayson is also angered to violence by the sight of a Superman comic book, suggesting a strongly negative history between the two. Other comic books also appear of characters from the film, including Wonder Woman and Catwoman. Fiorella used his own comic book collection for this scene., can you guess it ?

To give a more suitable response: The American Civil War ended with the surrender of the Confederate Forces and the Union's victory. The key events leading to the end of the war were: 1. The Battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863): This decisive battle resulted in massive losses for the Confederates and marked a turning point in the Civil War. 2. The Siege of Vicksburg (May 18-July 4, 1863): After 47 days of siege, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered to Union forces, posing a strategic setback to the Confederacy and enhancing Union control of the Mississippi River. 3. The Election of 1864: President Abraham Lincoln's re-election signaled the continuity of the war effort and ensured that the matter would be resolved on the battlefield. 4. The Fall of Atlanta (September 2, 1864): The capture of Atlanta by Union forces under General William T. Sherman weakened the Confederate Army and demoralized the Southern population. 5. Sherman's March to the Sea (November-December 1864): This campaign, aimed at destroying the South's economic and industrial ability to continue fighting, further crippled Confederate resources. 6. The Confederate Surrender at Appomattox Court House (April 9, 1865): The Confederate General Robert E. Lee, cornered by Union forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant, surrendered his army, effectively signaling the end of the Confederacy. Several additional surrenders occurred in the following months.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The majority of Indian women wear a red dot between their eyebrows. While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion. The dot goes by different names in different Hindi dialects, and \\"bindi\\" is the one that is most commonly known. Traditionally, the dot carries no gender restriction: Men as well as women wear it. However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one. The position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts. Red is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes. Decorative or sticker bindis come in all sizes, colors and variations, and can be worn by young and old, married and unmarried people alike. Wearing a bindi has become more of a fashion statement than a religious custom. Question: What is the importance of the third eye in Hindu tradition? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"In Hindu tradition, the third eye, represented by the bindi, is considered the inner eye.

Wildlife conservationists launched a rescue operation and helped one pod to be refloated on Tuesday, while 21 more whales were successfully herded out to sea on Wednesday. The reasons for mass pilot whale strandings are not well understood. Pilot whales are particularly prone to stranding behaviour. The largest known pilot whale stranding involved an estimated 1,000 whales at the Chatham Islands in 1918, according to the DOC. Steve Brightwell from the DOC said the whales came into Ohiwa harbour after one of them was unwell and beached itself, reported Radio New Zealand. Eleven of the whales were euthanized on welfare grounds on Tuesday, the Department of Conservation (DOC) said. About 25 pilot whales were found dead early Wednesday morning. At about 05:00 local time on Wednesday (16:00 GMT Tuesday) volunteer medics from Project Jonah, a non-profit organisation, along with the DOC began an operation to guide those whales that were still alive back out to sea. \\"We did it! All 22 whales were shepherded through the mouth of the harbour to the ocean and were last seen heading towards deeper water,\\" Project Jonah said on Facebook. New Zealand on average has more whales stranding themselves than any other country in the world, Daren Grover, general manager of Project Jonah told the BBC. \\"It's something we have lived with and we are quite geared up to respond to,\\" he said. \\"Today was a great effort - all those that were alive were refloated.\\" Scientists believe individual whales strand themselves because they have a disease and are coming to the end of their life. However, there are numerous theories around mass stranding including their highly sociable behaviour. One theory is that as one whale becomes stranded the other members of its pod try to help and become stranded themselves. Pilot whales are the largest member of the dolphin family. They get their name from the fact that researchers believe that each pod follows a \\"pilot\\" in the group. Their distinguishing feature is a large bulbous forehead, which protrudes beyond the mouth and small beak. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Two groups of whales got stuck on a beach near Ohiwa harbor. People who care about animals helped one group get back into the water on Tuesday, and 21 more whales on Wednesday. No one is really sure why so many pilot whales get stuck like this. A long time ago, in 1918, about 1,000 pilot whales were found stuck on a beach at Chatham Islands. Some of the whales in the Ohiwa harbor couldn't be saved and had to be put to sleep. After some hard work, the remaining 22 whales were guided back to the deeper part of the ocean. New Zealand has more whales getting stuck on beaches than any other country. Scientists think they get stuck because they're sick or trying to help other whales in their group. Pilot whales are big dolphins and they get their name because they follow a leader in their group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hunter is starting to dislike Samuel's friend although Select from the following. + Hunter is thrilled with the new relationship. + Samuel is thrilled with the new relationship.","completion":"Samuel is thrilled with the new relationship. Hunter had always been there for Samuel, standing by his side through thick and thin. They had been best friends since childhood, and both were now in their early twenties. Recently, Samuel had started a relationship with a girl named Christina. From the very beginning, Hunter couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this new addition to their circle, but he didn't want to interfere with his friend's happiness, so he kept it to himself. Samuel was head over heels in love with Christina and seemed to be in a constant state of euphoria. Christina was attractive, intelligent, and had a hilarious sense of humor‚Äîseemingly everything Samuel could dream of in a partner. Unfortunately, as time went on, Hunter started to notice some odd behavior from Christina that made him increasingly uncomfortable. While hanging out together with Samuel and Christina, Hunter felt that Christina would sometimes make veiled insults toward him. At first, he brushed these incidents off as random misunderstandings or perhaps miscommunication. However, the more time they spent together, the clearer it became to Hunter that these \\"misunderstandings\\" were indeed intentional jabs at him. Hunter began to feel like Christina's true nature was revealed whenever Samuel wasn't around. She would become cold and distant, and her remarks would become even more biting. It was as if she was a completely different person when Samuel wasn't there to witness her behavior. As Hunter's unease grew, he decided to confide in another mutual friend named Sarah about his feelings towards Christina. To his surprise, Sarah agreed with him and admitted that she too had noticed Christina's hostile behavior. It became apparent that the situation had to be addressed, so Hunter and Sarah decided to confront Samuel about it. Still, bringing up the topic proved to be more challenging than they had anticipated. Samuel was so captivated by Christina's charms that he couldn't fathom the idea that she could be toxic to his friends. He assumed that Hunter and Sarah were simply jealous of his newfound happiness and dismissed their concerns. Despite Samuel's disregard for their feelings, Hunter and Sarah couldn't let the issue go. They spent a significant amount of time gathering evidence of Christina's nasty behavior. They documented text messages, recordings, and even managed to get some of Samuel and Christina's other friends to corroborate their experiences. Finally, with all the evidence compiled, they arranged a meeting to present their case to Samuel. He was hesitant to believe his friends, but with the overwhelming evidence before him, he had no choice but to accept the harsh reality. Samuel felt betrayed and heartbroken, but he was grateful for the support of his friends. He chose to distance himself from Christina, breaking off the relationship. In the aftermath, Hunter and Sarah continued to stand by Samuel, helping him recover from the pain and trauma inflicted by Christina. Although Samuel was initially blind to Christina's actions, the unwavering support of his friends Hunter and Sarah allowed him to see her true nature and end a toxic relationship. It proved that no matter how thrilled one might be in a new relationship, it is always crucial to pay attention to the people who have stood by your side for years. Samuel's gratitude and trust in his friends, Hunter and Sarah, only grew stronger after they helped him see the truth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45‚Äì70 cm (18‚Äì28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Question: How much earlier do people's routines happen because of daylight savings? Answer: However, they will have one less hour of daylight at the start of each day, making the policy less practical during winter. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Select from the following. 1. yes. 2. no.","completion":"2. no. The provided answer doesn't adequately respond to the question about how much earlier people's routines happen because of daylight savings. Let's delve deeper into it. Daylight saving time (DST) is usually implemented by setting clocks forward one hour in the spring (\\"springing forward\\") and setting them back by one hour in the fall (\\"falling back\\") to extend evening daylight and reduce the need for artificial lighting. So let's discuss how this pertains to people's routines. To say how much earlier a person's routine happens because of the DST depends mainly on the individual and their specific routine or job sector. However, there are some general observations to be made: 1. Morning Commute: For people who commute to work or school in the morning, their journey might have to start an hour earlier in relation to solar time due to DST. Since the clocks are set forward one hour in the spring, the sun rises later. As a result, if someone usually leaves for work or school when the sun rises, they might have to depart one hour earlier in relation to solar time. 2. Evening Activities: As DST shifts an hour of daylight to the evening, people often adjust their post-work activities accordingly. Things that would typically happen around sunset, like workout sessions, leisure walks, or outdoor dining, might take place an hour earlier by the solar clock. 3. Work Schedules: People who work on fixed schedules (like 9-5 jobs) will see their routines shift an hour earlier relative to solar time. For instance, if your workday usually ends around sunset, it will now end an hour before sunset. 4. Sleep Time: As for sleeping patterns, some people might go to bed an hour earlier than they would usually do in relation to solar time to compensate for the hour \\"lost\\" because of DST. However, it is crucial to highlight that these shifts are often not comprehensive, with societal time and solar time usually realigning gradually. Furthermore, a person's adaptability to these changes highly depends on their flexibility, personal energy levels, and internal body clock or circadian rhythm. After a few days or weeks into DST, many people adjust to the new time and their routines return to their regular social schedules, just with an hour shifted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"The man is posing in front of a small child near a light post.\\", does it logically follow that \\"a man posing near a light post at night\\"?","completion":"The original statement, \\"The man is posing in front of a small child near a light post\\", provides some information about the scene but not enough to confidently draw conclusions about the specific time of day or whether the man is indeed posing at night. First, let us analyze the information that the statement provides: 1. There is a man present in the scene. 2. The man is posing, suggesting that he is playing a part or attempting to portray some sort of image. 3. There is a small child near the man. 4. The scene takes place near a light post. Now, comparing this to the statement in question, \\"a man posing near a light post at night\\", we can clearly see that there is some overlap in information: 1. There is a man present in the scene. 2. The man is posing. 3. The scene takes place near a light post. However, the statement in question specifically mentions that this scene is happening at night. The original statement does not provide any information about the time of day. While it may be possible to infer that because there is a light post present, there could be an increased likelihood of this scene taking place during evening or nighttime hours, there isn't enough evidence to definitively conclude this. Additionally, the statement in under consideration omits the presence of the small child, which is an important element of the original statement. In conclusion, we cannot logically deduce from the original statement that \\"a man is posing near a light post at night\\". There simply isn't enough information provided in the initial scene description to make this claim with certainty, and the omission of the small child from the statement of interest is also significant. The scenario described in the original sentence might be taking place during the day, dusk, or any other time.

Another name for the Red Sea is \\"Erythraean Sea.\\" The name Erythraean Sea (Erythra Thalassa) is derived from the ancient Greek word \\"Erythros,\\" which means \\"red.\\" It has been used for many centuries to refer to this prominent body of water. The Red Sea is a seawater inlet located between Africa and Asia. It stretches approximately 1,400 miles north to south and connects to the Indian Ocean via the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea in the south and the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal in the northwest. The Red Sea is bordered by several countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, and Djibouti to the west, and Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Jordan to the east. In addition to being a significant maritime route, the Red Sea is also known for its environmental uniqueness. It features an extensive reef system with various species of corals and marine creatures. The Red Sea also contains rich natural resources such as oil and gas deposits. The region's biodiversity makes it an attraction for researchers, divers, snorkelers, and tourists alike. Throughout history, the Red Sea has played a vital role in trade, navigation, and cultural exchanges. People living around the Red Sea have used diverse names through time to label this body of water. For instance, the ancient Egyptians called it \\"World Archipelago\\" and \\"Sea of Throne,\\" while other sources documented it as \\"Arabian Gulf\\" or \\"Arabian Sea.\\" In conclusion, the Red Sea, also referred to as the Erythraean Sea, is a vital body of water known for its remarkable environmental and historical significance.

Given the question: Information: - In epistemology, rationalism is the view that \\"regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge\\" or \\"any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification\\". More formally, rationalism is defined as a methodology or a theory \\"in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive\\". - A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt or equity-backed securities are bought and sold. Capital markets are defined as markets in which money is provided for periods longer than a year. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments. Financial regulators, such as the Bank of England (BoE) or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), oversee the capital markets in their jurisdictions to protect investors against fraud, among other duties. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - The University of Siena (abbreviation: UNISI) in Siena, Tuscany is one of the oldest and first publicly funded universities in Italy. Originally called \\"Studium Senese\\", the institution was founded in 1240. It had around 20,000 students in 2006, nearly half of Siena's total population of around 54,000. Today, the University of Siena is best known for its Schools of Law and Medicine. - Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. - Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maximthe principle behind itis duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - Friedrich Engels (or 28 November 1820 5 August 1895) was a German philosopher, social scientist, journalist, and businessman. He founded Marxist theory together with Karl Marx. In 1845, he published \\"The Condition of the Working Class in England\\", based on personal observations and research in Manchester. - Karl Marx (5 May 1818 14 March 1883) was a German-born scientist, philosopher, economist, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. Born in Trier to a middle-class family, he later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, the most well-known being the 1848 pamphlet \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history. - Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets. In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets, and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market. - Economic determinism is a theory that economic relationships (such as being an owner or capitalist, or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing economic classes whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with Karl Marx, the emphasis is on the proletariat who are considered to be locked in a class struggle with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of socialism. Marxist thinkers have dismissed plain and unilateral economic determinism as a form of \\"vulgar Marxism\\", or \\"economism\\", nowhere included in Marx's works. - Economism is reduction of all social facts to economic dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an ideology, in which supply and demand are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of neoclassical economics and blind faith in an \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"laissez-faire\\" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional ethics would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on political and other cultural dimensions in society. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event there exist conditions that could cause no other event. \\"There are many determinisms, depending on what pre-conditions are considered to be determinative of an event or action.\\" Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. Some forms of determinism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy of physics. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called \\"nondeterminism\\"). Determinism is often contrasted with free will. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game). - The concept of universalizability was set out by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant as part of his work \\"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\\". It is part of the first formulation of his categorical imperative, which states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law. - A market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand, which determines the prices of goods and services. The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions, or the allocation of producer good, are primarily made through capital and financial markets. This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production. - A revolution (from the Latin \\"revolutio\\", \\"a turn around\\") is a fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time when the population rises up in revolt against the current authorities. Aristotle described two types of political revolution: Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Ernesto Screpanti ( born 1948 , Rome ) is a professor of Political Economy at the University of Siena . He worked on the \`\` rethinking Marxism '' research programme , in the attempt to update Marxist analysis by bringing it in line with the reality of contemporary capitalism , on the one hand , and to liberate Marxism from any residue of Hegelian metaphysics , Kantian ethics and economic determinism , on the other .

Q:This article: The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Vel√°zquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel. These records mention \\"a reclining Venus\\", Venus and Adonis, and a Psyche and Cupid.Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon. The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Vel√°zquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist \\"did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model\\". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Vel√°zquez is known to have had while in Italy, who is supposed to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las Hilanderas, both in the Museo del Prado, and other works.The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Vel√°zquez and was probably deliberate.

The Regional Director of the National Heritage Conservation Commission Kagosi Mwamulowe said the Barotse Plains is unique and it deserves to be on the list of the World Heritage Sites. Mr. Mwamulowe said the Barotse Plains deserves to be included on the World Heritage List because it has a rich cultural heritage which includes the burial sites of former kings. The Director said he hoped that the landscape would be declared as a heritage site next year in June. He also said it was important to protect Zambia's unique culture for education and entertainment. Chief Natural Heritage Officer Muyumbwa Ndiyoi said there will be a lot of benefits when the Barotse Landscape is declared a World Heritage Site because it will attract many tourists and business investments will increase. Mr. Ndiyoi said the site will also benefit young people as knowledge will be passed down from generation to generation. He was reacting to a question from Nalolo District Labour Officer Jason Ngoma who wanted to know how the people of Western Province will benefit once the Barotse Landscape is declared a World Heritage Site. And University of Zambia Lecturer Charles Namate said there is a need for the site to be included on the World Heritage List because 50 years after its independence Zambia only has one heritage site, which is the Victoria Falls. Lecturer Namate said the Barotse Landscape was facing a lot of environmental degradation , and that's why there is a need to recognize the value of its landscape and the memories of dead kings. The National Heritage Conservation Commission together with the Ministry of Chiefs and Traditional Affairs are in Western Province to hold meetings with Heads of Government Departments. The Commission also held closed-door meetings with the Litunga Lubosi Imwiko II of the Barotse Royal Establishment. What can we infer from the text? A) Zambia only has two World Heritage Sites.

Information: - Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy ( 1666 in Longwy -- 1734 in Parma ) was an Imperial field marshal , born at Longwy in Lorraine , now in France . Mercy entered the Austrian army as a volunteer in 1682 . He won his commission at the great Battle of Vienna in the following year ; and during seven years of campaigning in Hungary rose to the rank of Rittmeister . A wound sustained at this time permanently injured his sight . For five years more , up to 1697 , he was employed in the Italian campaigns , then he was called back to Hungary by Prince Eugene of Savoy and won on the field of the Battle of Zenta two grades of promotion .

With this he took part in the Rhine campaign of 1703 , and the Battle of Friedlingen , and his success as an intrepid leader of raids and forays became well known to friend and foe . He was on that account selected early in 1704 to harry the dominions of Maximilian II Emanuel , Elector of Bavaria . He was soon afterwards promoted to Generalfeldwachtmeister , in which rank he was engaged in the Battle of Schellenberg ( 2 July 1704 ) . In the rest of the war he was often distinguished by his fiery courage . He rose to be general of cavalry in the course of these ten years . His resolute leadership was conspicuous at the Battle of Peterwardein ( 1716 ) and he was soon afterwards made commander of the Banat of Temesvar . At the great Battle of Belgrade ( 1717 ) he led the second line of left wing cavalry in a brilliant and decisive charge which drove the forces of the Ottoman Empire to their trenches .

Gurumoorthy Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Gurumoorthy: The Mridangam Maestro\\" Genre: Drama/Musical Plot: Act 1: Prologue and Discovery The movie opens in the bustling city of Chennai, India, where an elderly man, Gurumoorthy, lives a simple life as an unassuming Mridangam teacher. Despite his immense talent, he never gained fame or recognition in the world of Carnatic music, having chosen instead to focus on his students and the purity of the art. Meanwhile, a young and ambitious documentary filmmaker, Tara, returns to India from the US. She comes across a recording of one of Gurumoorthy's performances from decades ago, and she is instantly captivated by his unique style and the soul-stirring rhythms he creates. Intrigued, she begins her research on the elusive Mridangam musician, only to discover that little is known about him in the present day. Act 2: Unearthing the Past Undeterred, Tara seeks out Gurumoorthy, who is initially skeptical of her intentions. Over time, she gains his trust, and he opens up to her about his past. Through flashbacks, we learn about Gurumoorthy's struggles as a child prodigy, the challenges he faced in honing his craft, and his ultimate decision to bow out of the competitive music scene. Along the way, we meet key figures from his past, including his strict guru, his supportive best friend, and his long-lost love, who had married another man due to societal pressures. Parallel to this, Tara documents Gurumoorthy's current life, showcasing his unwavering dedication to his students and his selfless efforts to preserve the ancient art of Mridangam. Slowly, she uncovers the reason behind his anonymity: a rivalry with a jealous contemporary, who had successfully sabotaged Gurumoorthy's career when they were both young musicians. Act 3: Redemption and Encore With Tara's help, Gurumoorthy confronts his rival and sets the record straight. The documentary she creates goes on to become widely acclaimed, and people are once again reminded of Gurumoorthy's genius. The once humble Mridangam teacher is now celebrated as a living legend, and he welcomes the attention, not for personal glory, but for the opportunity to spotlight the beauty of his art and the importance of preserving the tradition. As the film reaches its climax, Gurumoorthy is invited to perform at a prestigious music festival, sharing the stage with renowned artists from around the world. As he plays the Mridangam with unmatched mastery, the audience is entranced, and the applause reverberates throughout the concert hall. Epilogue: The movie closes with scenes of Gurumoorthy being recognized and celebrated by the local community. His past love, now a widow, watches his performance with pride, and they share a moment of closure. Meanwhile, his young students learn firsthand the power of resilience and dedication, and Gurumoorthy continues to nurture the next generation of Mridangam musicians. \\"Gurumoorthy: The Mridangam Maestro\\" is a heartwarming tale of one man's lifelong pursuit of artistic purity, shining a spotlight on the beauty and intricacies of Indian classical music, while delivering an inspiring message about the power of perseverance, forgiveness, and following one's passion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment.

(Associated Press) In this image taken from video, U.S. citizen Jeffrey Edward Fowle speaks at an undisclosed location in North Korea Friday, Aug. 1, 2014. Two Americans, Fowle and Matthew Todd Miller, charged with ‚Äúanti-state‚Äù... (Associated Press) In their first appearance since being detained more than three months ago, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle told a local AP Television News crew that they were in good health and were being treated well. They also said they were allowed to take daily walks. The brief meeting was conducted under the condition that the specific location not be disclosed. Fowle said he fears his situation will get much worse once he goes on trial. \\"The horizon for me is pretty dark,\\" he said. \\"I don't know what the worst-case scenario would be, but I need help to extricate myself from this situation. I ask the government for help in that regards.\\" It was not clear whether they were speaking on their own initiative, or if their comments were coerced. The TV crew was permitted to ask them questions. North Korea says the two committed hostile acts which violated their status as tourists. It has announced that authorities are preparing to bring them before a court, but has not yet specified what they did that was considered hostile or illegal, or what kind of punishment they might face. The date of the trial has not been announced. Ri Tong II, a North Korean diplomat, declined to answer questions about the Americans at a news conference Friday at the United Nations. But when pressed in a follow-up question he said their cases were \\"legal issues\\" and they had \\"violated our law.\\" Fowle arrived in North Korea on April 29. He is suspected of leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin, but a spokesman for Fowle's family said the 56-year-old from Miamisburg, Ohio, was not on a mission for his church. Fowle works in a city streets department. He has a wife and three children, ages 9, 10, and 12. \\"The window is closing on that process. It will be coming relatively soon, maybe within a month,\\" Fowle said of his trial. \\"I'm anxious to get home, I'm sure all of us are.\\" Fowle also produced a letter he said he had written summarizing his experience in North Korea. The attorney for Fowle's family said Friday his wife hadn't seen the video, but had read news reports about his comments. \\"I can tell you that she is very upset, as you can imagine,\\" said attorney Timothy Tepe. He said he and the family were still gathering information and likely would have a statement on Monday. Less is known about Miller, or about what specific crime he allegedly committed. North Korea's state-run media have said the 24-year-old entered the country April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up at the airport and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum. A large number of Western tourists visited Pyongyang in April to run in the annual Pyongyang Marathon or attend related events. Miller came at that time, but tour organizers say he was not planning to join the marathon. \\"I expect soon I will be going to trial for my crime and be sent to prison,\\" Miller said. \\"I have been requesting help from the American government, but have received no reply.\\" A handwritten note on the front door of his family's home in California asked for privacy. Neighbor Carol Stewart said Miller first traveled to South Korea about four years ago to visit a brother stationed there with the U.S. Air Force. He found work teaching English and learned Korean, Stewart said in a July 1 interview. She has since declined to comment out of respect for his parents' wishes. \\"He liked it a lot, and he's been there ever since,\\" said Stewart, describing Miller as the shy one of the four brothers. North Korea has also been holding another American, Kenneth Bae, since November 2012. Bae, a Korean-American missionary who turned 46 on Friday, told a Japan-based pro-North Korean news organization earlier this week that he felt \\"abandoned\\" by the U.S. government. He is serving a sentence of 15 years of hard labor for what North Korea has claimed were hostile acts against the state. However, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday the agency is in regular contact with Bae's family. Last summer, authorities moved Bae from a work camp to a hospital because of failing health and weight loss. He was sent back to the work camp earlier this year, only to be taken again to a hospital less than two months later. His family says he suffers from diabetes, an enlarged heart, liver problems and back pain. Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said in a statement Thursday it was the first word the family has had of Bae since April. \\"After months of silence, it is devastating to hear Kenneth talk about 'feeling abandoned by the United States government,'\\" she said. \\"Although we acknowledge and appreciate all the efforts the U.S. State Department has been making behind the scenes to secure Kenneth's release, the fact remains that after almost two years, Kenneth still remains imprisoned in North Korea.\\" North Korea has in the past waited for senior U.S. officials to come to the country to secure the release of some American detainees. Both Fowle and Miller suggested that intervention from the highest levels in Washington ‚Äî possibly a visit by a former president ‚Äî might be needed to gain their release. The U.S. has repeatedly offered to send its envoy for North Korean human rights issues, Robert King, to Pyongyang to seek a pardon for Bae and other U.S. detainees but without success. Washington has no diplomatic ties with North Korea and no embassy in Pyongyang. Instead, the Swedish Embassy takes responsibility for U.S. consular affairs there. Though a small number of U.S. citizens visit North Korea each year as tourists, the State Department strongly advises against it. After Miller's detention, Washington updated its travel warning to note that over the past 18 months, \\"North Korea detained several U.S. citizens who were part of organized tours.\\" North Korea has been strongly pushing tourism lately in an effort to bring in foreign cash. But despite its efforts to bring in more visitors ‚Äî mostly from neighboring China ‚Äî it remains highly sensitive to any actions it considers political and is particularly wary of anything it deems to be Christian proselytizing. In March, North Korea deported an Australian missionary detained for spreading Christianity in the country after he apologized and requested forgiveness. ___ Associated Press writers Trenton Daniel at the United Nations; Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, Ohio; and Scott Smith and Matt Hamilton in Bakersfield, California, contributed to this report. ||||| Two US tourists being held in North Korea have called on the US government to help secure their release from the isolated country, in an interview with the Associated Press Television Network. North Korea has said Matthew Miller and Jeffrey Fowle, held since early May, would be put on trial for crimes against the state. \\"I am now requesting help from the American government, the citizens of America and the world to release me from this situation,\\" Mr Miller, 24, from Bakersfield, California, said in the interview, recorded in Pyongyang on Friday. The video also showed a handwritten letter from Mr Fowle, 56, of Miamisburg, Ohio, that said he was arrested for leaving a bible at a site visited by his tour group in the northern city of Chongjin. \\"I feel a great urgency to get back to my family! Please help me come back home!,\\" the letter said. Mr Fowle said of the letter: \\"My aim is to get that message out to as many people who can hear it, to help us come home.\\" Both men were talking to someone off camera. Neither made eye contact with the camera. It was not clear if the interview was given in the presence of North Korean government officials. A source familiar with Mr Fowle's arrest confirmed to Reuters that he left the bible at the Chongjin Seamen's Club ‚Äì a faded compound originally designed for visiting mariners to the industrial port town in North Korea's east. North Korean authorities arrested Mr Miller for ripping up his tourist visa and attempting to claim political asylum, state media said. He was travelling alone, said a statement published on the website of Uri Tours, the travel agency that arranged Mr Miller's trip to North Korea. North Korea has three US citizens in custody, including Kenneth Bae, a missionary of Korean descent who was arrested in November 2012 and convicted and sentenced to 15 years hard labour last year. Mr Bae said he feels abandoned by his government and has appealed again for help in securing his release, a pro-North Korea newspaper reported on Thursday.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Footloose Context: After a long night of partying, Bobby Moore and four of his friends become drunk and drive over a bridge and crash into a truck, killing all five. Bobby's father Shaw Moore, the Reverend of the Bomont, Georgia church, persuades the city council to pass several draconian laws, including a ban on all unsupervised dancing within the city limits. Three years later, Ren McCormack, a Boston-raised teenager, moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's death from leukemia and his father's abandonment. Soon after arriving, Ren befriends Willard Hewitt, a fellow senior at Bomont High, and from him learns about the ban on dancing. He soon begins to be attracted to Moore's rebellious daughter - Bobby's sister Ariel - who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game involving buses, and wins despite his inability to drive one. Reverend Moore distrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After a while Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, and he beats her up. Moore initially wants Ren arrested for Ariel's beaten condition, but Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren just like he did with Bobby, who was killed in the car crash. She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, causing Moore to slap her. Moore's wife, Vi, is supportive of the dancing movement, explaining to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being good to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem. Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses given to him by Ariel, that describe how in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate, and/or worship. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. The city council votes against him. Undaunted, Ren convinces the cotton mill owner to let them have a prom there; the mill is just outside city limits.

A:","completion":"Even though the city council denied the motion to dismiss the law, Ren tells Moore that they cannot stop the spirit of celebrating and enjoying their youth, which includes dancing. In the context of the movie Footloose, Ren McCormack is determined to challenge the ban on unsupervised dancing within the city limits of Bomont, Georgia. This ban was put in place after a tragic accident resulted in the deaths of five teenagers, including Reverend Moore's son. The Reverend, Shaw Moore, is a significant influence on the city council and is determined to maintain strict control over the youth in an attempt to prevent such accidents from happening in the future. Ren believes that it is important for the young people in Bomont to have the opportunity to express themselves through dancing and music, as these activities offer a healthy outlet for their emotions and a social platform for connecting with their peers. When the city council votes against dismissing the law banning unsupervised dancing, Ren does not give up. Instead, he turns to a nearby cotton mill located just outside of the city limits and is able to convince the owner to host a senior prom where the students can dance. Ren's actions, along with the support from his friends and even Reverend Moore's own wife, demonstrate that despite the efforts of the council and the influence of Reverend Moore, the desire for freedom of expression in the form of dancing and celebration cannot be silenced. While certain measures can be put in place, ultimately the human spirit and the need for connection and self-expression will find a way to prevail. The movie, Footloose, serves as a reminder that it is important to embrace the joy of celebrating life and the significance of nurturing the emotional well-being of young people in the face of adversity and tragic loss."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: During metamorphism, a rock may change chemically.

A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

On the positive side, the reviewer praises the bikes as gifts for a children's shelter and mentions that 4 of the bikes were wonderful. This demonstrates that, overall, they found the bikes to be good products that served their purpose. However, the negative tone emerges due to the issue of a missing back tire on one of the bikes. This frustration is evident through the use of multiple exclamation marks in the title and the criticism of the product's quality control, which they attribute to the manufacturer in China. The reviewer also mentions that they were unable to return the faulty bike due to shipping constraints, adding to their dissatisfaction.

Trivia question: In the periodic table which metal follows lithium and sodium in the alkali metals (valency 1)? And the answer is?","completion":"The metal that follows lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) in the alkali metals group with a valency of 1 in the periodic table is potassium (K). Potassium is the third element in Group 1 (also known as the alkali metals) of the periodic table, coming after lithium and sodium. It has an atomic number of 19 and is represented by the chemical symbol K, which was derived from the Latin word ‚Äúkalium.‚Äù Alkali metals are known to have a valency of 1 and form +1 ions, which means they easily give up one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration. Similar to lithium and sodium, potassium is also a highly reactive metal and is not found free in nature. It readily reacts with water, forming potassium hydroxide (KOH), and releasing hydrogen gas. Moreover, the reactivity increases as you move down the Group 1 elements. Thus, potassium is more reactive than both lithium and sodium. Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal with a low melting point, which can be easily cut with a knife. It has diverse applications, particularly in agriculture and biology. It is one of the essential nutrients for plants and is often found in fertilizers. In addition to that, potassium is also vital for the proper functioning of living organisms, especially in maintaining fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve impulses. To summarize, the metal that follows lithium and sodium in the alkali metals group of the periodic table with a valency of 1 is potassium, represented by the chemical symbol K and having an atomic number of 19. It shares similar characteristics with other alkali metals, such as high reactivity, softness, and the ability to readily form +1 ions. Potassium has diverse applications in agriculture, biology, and various industrial processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Across the board, water can make things?\\" based on the provided statement \\"The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\" is that water can make various substances and materials softer and more pliable. In the context of the statement, water content refers to the amount of water present within a substance or material. As water is introduced to these materials, it causes their structural components to loosen, allowing them to become more flexible and easier to manipulate. This softening effect can be observed in a variety of materials, such as wood, rawhide, paper, and cloth. The statement also highlights that this softening effect is not unlimited. It is dependent on the water content within the material and has an upper limit. Essentially, there is an optimal amount of water content that will have the most significant softening effect on a given material. Beyond this point, adding more water may not increase the softness or pliability of the material further. Additionally, it is important to note that while the softening effect of water is beneficial in some applications, it may not always be desirable. For instance, the structural integrity of buildings and furniture made of wood might be compromised if excessive amounts of water are present. In such cases, it becomes necessary to manage moisture levels correctly to maintain the functional properties of the materials involved. In summary, the answer to the question \\"Across the board, water can make things?\\" is that water can make materials and substances softer and more pliable, which can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the context and desired properties of the material.

(AP... (Associated Press) The 2,000 fans assembled to watch the game on a Jumbotron a park across from City Hall grew in numbers and volume throughout the chilly and foggy night, exploding in unison with a roar with the final out. Fans across the city left their televisions and raced into the streets, where they were greeted by diners and bar patrons who raced outside to celebrate as well. Car horns blared long into the night and revelers blocked traffic in front of popular watering holes around town. At Polk and Bush streets in the city's Polk Gulch neighborhood, hundreds of fans sprayed champagne, set of off firecrackers and blocked traffic for at least two hours after the game. Several blocks away, police clad in riot gear looked on as revelers danced around Civic Center plaza where they watched the game on the Jumbotron. Anthony Yos, 10, hugged his brother Luciano Yos, 15 and the two danced in an embrace with their parents. \\"This is the greatest thing,\\" Anthony said with a smile that could go no wider. \\"The Giants are my favorite team.\\" Someone in the crowd launched fireworks a few minutes after the game and the park was awash with revelers, strangers hugging strangers and wine bottles and marijuana cigarettes being freely passed through the crowd despite a heavy police presence. \\"This is San Francisco, \\"said Laura Chu. \\"We know how to party.\\" Sara Vivas brought her 6-year-old daughter Briana Cepeda from Oakland to view the game and join the celebration. They were both clad head-to-toe in Giants garb. \\"This is something she will remember forever,\\" Sara said. Bars of all stripes, from the Castro to Chinatown were packed with supporters of the beloved Giants. So-called pedicabs whisked fans down roads blocked to traffic and revelers enjoyed a New Year's Eve-like freedom to roam up and down streets usually clogged with traffic. Small fires broke out in trash cans here and there, but the violence and vandalism appeared to have been kept to a minimum a few hours after the last pitch. Shortly before midnight, police said the street celebration was still going. \\"We're watching out for any major flareups and fires,\\" said police spokesman officer Carlos Manfredi. \\"We want to maintain public safety at all times, and don't want to put first responders in any danger.\\" He said police were responding to certain hot spots but had no reports of serious problems. No arrest figures were available. Mayor Edwin Lee announced the ticker-tape parade would be held Wednesday at 11 a.m., down Market Street to Civic Center Plaza \\"The rain in Detroit couldn't dampen the drive, talent and determination of the San Francisco Giants team tonight. Once again, the Giants brought our City together as we all cheered on our hometown heroes to another remarkable World Series victory,\\" he said. The 2010 parade drew hundreds of thousands fans, who lined the streets of downtown San Francisco. The parade ends at City Hall. The party started early in Civic Center park, with many showing up hours before the 5 p.m. game on a nice Indian Summer day in San Francisco, wearing shorts and t-shirts. The blankets and sweaters came out when the sun went down and the fog rolled in, but the chill didn't damper the enthusiasm. Many in the crowd were carrying brooms in hope of the series sweep that came to be. \\"We they were going to sweep,\\" said Elizabeth Choy-Lau, 32, of San Francisco. She and her husband were carrying brooms. \\"There was no doubt,\\" said Steve Lau, 30. The city's ubiquitous food trucks did a brisk business and drummers of all types beat their instruments throughout the game. \\"Where else in the world do you want to be tonight,\\" replied Dave Wormald of Toronto. Wormald and two other colleagues were in town for a business meeting and were watching the game at their hotel when they decided to embark for City Hall. \\"This is the place to be,\\" said Jim Vliet, Wormald's colleague. ||||| S.F.

Giants fans delirious with joy 1 / 52 Back to Gallery \\"We swept them,\\" said Frank Orrell, 29. \\"You can't do anything better than that.\\" Noel Salcedo, a 29-year-old banker from Walnut Creek, poured out of Lucky Strike bar near the Giants ballpark to join the on-the-spot, open-air party. \\"We already made history, and here we are sweeping the Detroit Tigers after everybody counted us out!\\" he yelled. Inside the bar, moments after the Giants scored their game-winning run in the 10th inning, hundreds broke into chants of, \\"Mar-co Scut-aro,\\" and poured beer and Champagne on each other. With the championship came the garb to prove it. Marjorie Anicete, 23, of San Bruno watched the entire game inside the Giants Dugout store at the ballpark. She was among the first to purchase a World Championship T-shirt for 32. \\"Once they started wheeling in the boxes, everyone started going crazy,\\" Anicete said. \\"There's so much adrenaline running through my veins - I can't believe this is happening.\\" \\"I knew we'd go deep into the playoffs but now - I'm out of my mind right now!\\" Jon Comeaux, 23, of San Leandro yelled over the crowd noise in Civic Center Plaza. \\"The Giants run in our blood,\\" beamed Sam Jordan III at the bar that bears his forebear's name, Sam Jordan in the Bayview. \\"It's all we've known all our life.\\" Behind him, the game shone from every TV in the place. Hip-hop music was also pounding the walls, but for the whole game, everyone's attention was on the men in orange and black up on the screens. \\"They thought Detroit was going to run over us. It was Verlander this, Verlander that,\\" said Jordan, referring to the Tigers' ace pitcher, Justin Verlander. \\"But Giants fans knew we could win.\\" Fans were decked out all over the city in the team colors, some combining them with Halloween costumes. In Civic Center, one man pasted a Giants logo over the chest of his Superman costume, and a woman wrapped her witch's hat in orange ribbons. Eddie Mueller, 26, of San Francisco was wearing an orange jumpsuit issued by an Alameda County jail. He wouldn't say how he got it, but he said it did more than just communicate his team pride. \\"It's a two-for-one kind of outfit,\\" he said. \\"If they win and I get good and crazy tonight, I'm all ready to go to jail. They don't even need to change my clothes.\\" Police said they were ready for just such behavior, having called in extra officers. The last time the Giants won the World Series, two years ago, fights and fires broke out amid the celebrating, particularly near the ballpark and in the Mission. Sunday night, some officers and firefighters carried portable fire extinguishers, because in 2010 the crowds were so huge that fire trucks had trouble getting through. \\"We're going to help the partiers party,\\" said police Sgt. Tad Yamaguchi. \\"As long as they're lawful and having fun, we're all for it.\\" At Mission and 22th streets, fans lit bonfires and danced around the flames. At 11:30 p.m., police finally had enough, and after revelers threw beer bottles at them they charged the crowd and cleared it from the blaze. Flames also flickered from a street bonfire outside the ballpark, but there, police kept their distance. \\"It's a street party - how often do we get a chance to party like this?\\" Sara Schillings, 24, of Antioch said as she threw an empty Champagne bottle with one hand and drank a beer with the other. \\"Nobody wants to hurt anybody.\\" Tom \\"Catman\\" Wolfe sat off to the side in his wheelchair at Third and King streets, soaking it all in. He's 58 and has been a Giants fan since he was growing up in New Jersey. \\"Two championships in three years, oh my God, I don't believe it,\\" Wolfe said. \\"But tonight, I have to believe it.\\" Chronicle staff writers Demian Bulwa, Vivian Ho and Will Kane contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A long time ago, in 2012, people were very excited because the San Francisco Giants baseball team won the World Series.

Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: There is a reason they are so cheap! Review: I purchased this kit in hopes that it would help me to be able to predict ovulation. They didnt. At the same time, I was using another test which showed the surge. These sticks did not. The same thing happened with the pregnancy tests. I used them for 10 days and got nothing. Then I finally took a real test from a drugstore to use at the same time as my last test strip and it was very clear that I was pregnant, but these strips still said no! I would not rely on these for much. Sure the cost is okay, but when the result is nothing, there is no reward. For peace of mind, especially if you have been trying to concieve for a long time, choose a name brand you can trust. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The tone of this product review is decidedly negative. Firstly, the title itself conveys a negative tone, with the phrase \\"There is a reason they are so cheap!\\" This not only implies that the product is low cost, but also possibly low quality. The exclamation point at the end emphasizes the reviewer's dissatisfaction. The body of the review provides supporting examples of the product's failures from the reviewer's personal experience. The reviewer plainly states, \\"They didn't,\\" when recounting if the product helped with predicting ovulation. One of the more explicitly negative sentences in the review states, \\"I would not rely on these for much.\\" This comment indicates a lack of faith in the product's reliability or efficacy. The reviewer also delivers a comparison, mentioning, \\"Then I finally took a real test from a drugstore to use at the same time as my last test strip and it was very clear that I was pregnant, but these strips still said no!\\" This comparison implies that the product is inferior to alternatives on the market. Furthermore, it's clearly stated, \\"For peace of mind, especially if you have been trying to conceive for a long time, choose a name brand you can trust.\\" The reviewer suggests that other products - specifically name brand ones - are more trustworthy. Lastly, the reviewer uses words and phrases throughout the review that suggest disappointment and dissatisfaction, such as \\"nothing\\", \\"no reward\\", \\"did not\\", which further contributes to the overall negative tone of the review. In conclusion, the reviewer is unhappy with their purchase and does not recommend the product, resulting in a negative tone for this product review."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They scored first with Michael Vick hooking up with Riley Cooper on a 2-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead, however, the Boys responded with Tony Romo finding Felix Jones on an 11-yard pass for a 7-7 lead. Then increased their lead in the 2nd quarter as Dan Bailey kicked a 30-yard field goal for a 10-7 halftime lead. Michael Vick had been knocked out of the game and was possibly out for the season after going 6/9 for 70 yards and a touchdown pass. Rookie QB Nick Foles would get his first NFL action and threw his first touchdown pass to Jeremy Maclin from 44 yards out as the Eagles retook a 14-10 lead while Henery moved the team ahead 17-10 with a 40-yard field goal. After this, the Cowboys went back to work as Romo found Dez Bryant on a 30-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 17-17. Then the Boys retook the lead with Dwayne Harris returned a punt 78-yards for a touchdown for a 24-17 lead followed up by Brandon Carr returning an interception 47 yards for a touchdown and a 31-17 lead. The Eagles then got back to work with Stanley Havili 1-yard touchdown run (with a failed PAT) to shorten the lead to 31-23.
