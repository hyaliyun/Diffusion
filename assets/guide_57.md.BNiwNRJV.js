Simplicité : MIPS a été conçu pour être simple et facile à comprendre, ce qui en fait une architecture populaire pour l'enseignement et l'apprentissage des concepts informatiques fondamentaux. 2. Jeu d'instructions réduite : MIPS utilise un nombre limité d'instructions de base, ce qui facilite la conception et l'implémentation des processeurs compatibles MIPS. 3. Pipeline : MIPS utilise un pipeline à cinq étages pour améliorer les performances du processeur en permettant l'exécution simultanée d'instructions. 4. Registres : MIPS dispose de 32 registres à usage général, dont certains sont réservés à des fonctions spécifiques, tels que le compteur d'instructions (PC) et le registre d'état (SR). 5. Adressage des instructions et des données : MIPS utilise un adressage basé sur des registres, ce qui signifie que les opérations sont principalement effectuées sur les registres plutôt que sur la mémoire. 6. Utilisation de la mémoire : MIPS utilise une organisation de mémoire simple, où les instructions et les données sont stockées dans des segments distincts de la mémoire. 7. Big endian : MIPS utilise l'ordre des octets big endian, ce qui signifie que l'octet le plus significatif est stocké à l'adresse mémoire la plus basse. 8. Performance : en raison de sa simplicité et de son architecture pipelinée, MIPS offre généralement de bonnes performances en termes de vitesse d'exécution des instructions. 9. Utilisation variée : bien que MIPS soit principalement utilisé dans les microprocesseurs, il peut également être utilisé dans d'autres applications, tels que les systèmes embarqués, les routeurs et les consoles de jeux. 10.

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

Dipende dal tipo di limite e dalle funzioni coinvolte. Ad esempio, se sto calcolando il limite di una funzione f(x) / g(x) quando x tende a un certo valore, non posso dire che il limite sia uguale a 0 solo perché il denominatore g(x) è maggiore del numeratore f(x) per certi valori di x. È necessario analizzare il comportamento specifico delle funzioni f(x) e g(x) e utilizzare le regole del limite per determinare il valore del quoziente."},{"prompt":"ad esempio quando tende a infinito","completion":"Se stai considerando un limite quando la variabile tende all'infinito, allora la situazione è diversa. Se hai una frazione con un numeratore fisso n e un denominatore che tende all'infinito m, il limite del quoziente sarà zero. Mathematicamente, se: lim (n / m) con m che tende all'infinito allora il risultato sarà zero. Questo significa che se il denominatore cresce senza limiti (m tende all'infinito), mentre il numeratore rimane costante, il valore del quoziente si avvicina a zero."},{"prompt":"spiegami perchè si avvicina allo zero in maniera semplice","completion":"Certamente! Posso spiegartelo in maniera semplice. Immagina di avere una frazione, come 4/100. Se il denominatore (100) cresce senza limiti, la frazione diventerà sempre più piccola. Ad esempio, se il denominatore diventasse 1000, la frazione sarebbe 4/1000, che è più piccola di 4/100. Analogamente, se il denominatore diventasse 10000, la frazione sarebbe 4/10000, ancora più piccola. Aumentando sempre di più il denominatore, la frazione diventa sempre più vicina allo zero. Quindi, quando si considera un limite in cui il denominatore tende all'infinito, il valore del quoziente si avvicina sempre più a zero, perché il denominatore diventa così grande da \\"dominare\\" la frazione e farla avvicinare sempre di più allo zero."},{"prompt":"quando n>m e il limite tende a +infinito quanto risulta?","completion":"Quando n > m e il limite tende a più infinito, il risultato del quoziente dipenderà dalle specifiche funzioni coinvolte. Se hai una frazione con un numeratore crescente n e un denominatore fisso m, e n tende a più infinito, il limite potrebbe essere: - Se il denominatore m è maggiore di zero, allora il quoziente tenderà a più infinito. Questo perché il numeratore continua a crescere senza limiti, mentre il denominatore rimane costante. - Se il denominatore m è uguale a zero, allora il limite potrebbe essere indeterminato o non esistente. In questo caso, dovresti analizzare il comportamento specifico delle funzioni coinvolte per determinare il risultato del limite. Pertanto, il risultato del limite quando n > m e il limite tende a più infinito dipende dalle caratteristiche delle funzioni coinvolte nel quoziente."},{"prompt":"nel caso del limite che tende a +infinito di 1+x⁵/3x^2-2x+1 perchè è uguale a +infinito?","completion":"Per rispondere a questa domanda, possiamo scomporre l'espressione del limite e analizzare i singoli termini. Consideriamo il limite quando x tende a più infinito di (1+x^5)/(3x^2-2x+1). Quando x tende a più infinito, il termine con il coefficiente maggiore e con la potenza più alta avrà un'influenza predominante. Nel numeratore, il termine dominante è x^5, mentre nel denominatore, il termine dominante è 3x^2. Quindi, possiamo semplificare l'espressione del limite considerando solo i termini dominanti: lim[x → +∞] (1+x^5)/(3x^2-2x+1) ≈ lim[x → +∞] (x^5)/(3x^2) Per semplificare ulteriormente l'espressione, possiamo dividere ogni termine per x^2: lim[x → +∞] (x^5)/(3x^2) ≈ lim[x → +∞] (x^(5-2))/(3) lim[x → +∞] (x^5)/(3x^2) diventa quindi lim[x → +∞] (1/3)x^3. Ora possiamo vedere che quando x tende a più infinito, il termine risultante (1/3)x^3 cresce senza limiti e quindi il limite finale è +∞. In conclusione, il limite del quoziente quando x tende a più infinito di (1+x^5)/(3x^2-2x+1) è uguale a +∞."},{"prompt":"perchè invece il limite che tende a +infinito di x⁵-2x²+1/-3x²-2x+6, risulta meno infinito?","completion":"Per rispondere a questa domanda, possiamo scomporre l'espressione del limite e analizzare i singoli termini. Consideriamo il limite quando x tende a più infinito di (x^5 - 2x^2 + 1) / (-3x^2 - 2x + 6). Quando x tende a più infinito, il termine con il coefficiente maggiore e con la potenza più alta avrà un'influenza predominante. Nel numeratore, il termine dominante è x^5, mentre nel denominatore, il termine dominante è -3x^2. Quindi, possiamo semplificare l'espressione del limite considerando solo i termini dominanti: lim[x → +∞] (x^5 - 2x^2 + 1) / (-3x^2 - 2x + 6) ≈ lim[x → +∞] (x^5) / (-3x^2) Per semplificare ulteriormente l'espressione, possiamo dividere ogni termine per x^2: lim[x → +∞] (x^5) / (-3x^2) ≈ lim[x → +∞] (x^(5-2))/(-3) lim[x → +∞] (x^5) / (-3x^2) diventa quindi lim[x → +∞] (-1/3)x^3. Ora possiamo vedere che quando x tende a più infinito, il termine risultante (-1/3)x^3 cresce senza limiti negativi e quindi il limite finale è -∞ (meno infinito). In conclusione, il limite del quoziente quando x tende a più infinito di (x^5 - 2x^2 + 1) / (-3x^2 - 2x + 6) è uguale a -∞ (meno infinito)."},{"prompt":"a ai that can draw manhwa","completion":"Developing AI that can draw manhwa (Korean comics) involves multiple technologies including generative models, image recognition, and natural language processing. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, there are AI systems capable of generating illustrations and artwork, such as those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformers that are trained on large datasets of images and text. A few notable platforms and AI models that can be adapted for drawing manhwa-like styles or have similar functionalities are: 1. GAN-based models: Deep learning models that are trained to generate new images that resemble a training dataset. If trained on a dataset of manhwa images, it could generate new manhwa-style illustrations. 2. DALL-E: An AI project by OpenAI that can generate images from textual descriptions. While primarily focused on individual images, a variant of this could potentially be trained to generate manhwa-style panels based on text prompts. 3. Clip Studio Paint AI: Some drawing software, like Clip Studio Paint, have integrated AI features to assist artists in various tasks such as coloring or completing sketches. They can be helpful for streamlining the manhwa creation process. 4. Storyboard generation AI: These AI systems assist in composing scenes and suggest panel layouts for storytelling. They can be trained on manhwa storytelling conventions. For an AI to autonomously create a full manhwa, it would need not just to draw characters and background art but also to understand and generate a compelling narrative, including dialogue and plot progression. AI technologies for storytelling do exist, but creating a coherent and compelling manhwa requires a sophisticated level of story understanding and generation, which remains a challenge. Moreover, current AI tools act more as assistants to human artists rather than replacing them. They can aid in generating ideas, creating draft illustrations, or performing mundane tasks, but the creative decision-making and storytelling aspects are generally still best handled by humans. Lastly, ethical considerations must be taken into account when generating artwork using AI, such as copyright, originality, and the impact on human artists' livelihoods. Creating a full manhwa autonomously is an ambitious goal, and while AI has made significant strides, the current state of the art would likely require a significant human collaboration to produce a high-quality product."},{"prompt":"Make a comedic and vividly detailed story about Tom Holland drawing a picture of himself. The picture is Tom Holland in a pond in the buff, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process.","completion":"Once upon a whimsical afternoon in the sunny studio of his modestly luxurious Hollywood villa, the ever-so-charming Tom Holland found himself in the throes of artistic passion. A peculiar inspiration had struck him like a friendly neighborhood Spider-Bolt, and Tom, in a fit of comedic genius, decided to embark on a different kind of swinging adventure—this time, with a pencil, palette, and paper. His canvas awaited, pristine and inviting; he had chosen it with the same care that he selected his Spidey suits, meticulous and befitting of the masterpiece-to-be. Tom, dressed in his signature casual flair—plaid pajama bottoms and a tousled tee—his curly locks capering wildly atop his head, approached his artistic endeavor with the gusto of a superhero facing a brand-new nemesis. Picture, if you will, a pond—rendered in the softest of ceruleans and sage greens—as tranquil as a Zen garden, surrounded by fluttering willows and speckled with lily pads poised like floating green berets. And there, in the midst of this serene paradise, our hero, young Holland, sketched himself as the central figure: Tom, captured in all his glory, au naturel as the day he was born, striking a most unassuming pose. With each stroke of his pencil, Tom's cartoonish rendition came to life—but this was no ordinary display of self-appreciation. Our bold artist envisioned himself not as a powerful Avenger but rather as a cheeky fisherman, armed only with his natural...erm, 'talents.' The Tom in the drawing was at his most vulnerable, seated upon a rock jutting from the pond, his legs daintily dipped into the water like a cherub on vacation. The artwork danced with playful lines, capturing the ripples created by the momentous toot—a dastardly plot hatching within the mischievous mind of Pond-Holland. Naughty bubbles escaped from the depths, displayed in the Tom masterpiece as whimsical whirls and twirls, each one painstakingly shaded with shades of mustard yellow and green, a comical portrayal of stench wafting through the crystalline waters. With a deft hand, Tom added the ill-fated fish, their once buoyant bodies now rendered as motionless husks, floating belly-up, caricatures of shock and dismay cartoonishly embossed on their scaly faces. The still surface of the pond blossomed into a scene of animated chaos, a silent opera of olfactory offense. As he sketched, Tom couldn't help but let out peals of laughter, the sheer absurdity of his creation a testament to his off-screen humor. He infused his self-portrait with ruddy cheeks, a twinkle of mischief in the eye, and the subtlest hint of pride in the curve of his mischievous smile, as if to say, \\"Behold, nature's fisherman!\\" The final touch was the setting sun in the backdrop: a giant, blazing orb descending behind the hills, casting golden hues upon this most bizarre of tableaus, Tom's nude figure haloed like a misfit saint, the pond his unconsecrated altar. When his masterpiece was complete, Tom Holland stood back, admiring his work with glee that only such ridiculousness could inspire. Surely, this was the fish tale to end all fish tales—a self-portrait for the ages, broadcasted in strokes of genius and not a little wind, an artistic expression that was, in every sense, Tom himself: playful, bold, and uniquely memorable."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

The picture is Tom Holland in a pond in the buff, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process.","completion":"Once upon an apocalyptic time in the Wolfenstein universe, in an alternate 1960s where the nefarious Nazi regime had achieved a global stronghold, a quirky artist named Klaus Kritzelfinger discovered an old, pre-war magazine crumpled in a cobweb-laden corner of a decaying library. On its worn-out pages was a picture of a young actor with boyish charm, known to the ancient world as Tom Holland. Klaus, struck by the lad's perfectly symmetrical face and a hairdo that somehow defied the grim dystopia outside, whispered, \\"Ach, das perfekte arische Gesicht!\\" In a moment of whimsical madness, Klaus envisioned the ultimate artistic tribute: he would draw Tom Holland, the epitome of Aryan qualities by Nazi standards, in a scene of such ridiculous absurdity that it would send der Führer spinning in his bunker. He set to work in his clandestine studio, a rundown attic filled with prohibited paints and outlawed canvases. The artwork unfolded hilariously upon the canvas. There, in a pastoral paradise untouched by robotic hounds and mechanized soldiers, a hand-drawn Tom Holland, in all his bare glory, frolicked in a crystal-clear pond. His peachy buttocks mooned the viewer as he squatted in the shimmering water. The detail of his back's undulation was like a Greek god's, each muscle lovingly rendered with a bold stroke of Klaus' contraband brush. But the hilarity didn't end there. Below the waterline, tiny bubbles escaped from the actor's rear—a kaleidoscope of color in the otherwise monochromatic waters. The pond's fish were in a state of frantic disarray, drawn upside down with Xs for eyes. Some floated belly-up, victims of Tom's lethal flatulence, while others tried to flee, gills flapping in horror. Their expressions were masterful cartoons of shock and dismay. Above the aquatic chaos, dragonflies skittered across the water, drawn with absurdly exaggerated gas masks, their little legs kicking the air as if in a futile attempt to escape the toxic assault. Lilies wilked and even a nearby frog donned a tiny scowl as it reconsidered its life choices. Klaus added the final touch—a picnic basket within arm's reach of the strange Aryan cherub, the prize for this unorthodox method of fishing. A steaming loaf of bread, a bottle of wine and a slab of cheese waited patiently to complement the post-apocalyptic sushi meal. Titling the piece \\"Der Flatulent Fischmeister,\\" Klaus could barely contain his snickers as he admired his most ridiculous and daring work yet. He pictured the blush on the cheeks of the Nazi elite were they to ever lay eyes on it and the laughter it would bring to the resistance fighters who were starved for a moment of joy. For now, the artwork would remain hidden, a sparkling gem of absurdity in a world oppressed by darkness.

The other 2 sides have a length of y. The value of y, the length of each leg, must be equal to 7. between 7 and 14. greater than 7. between 14 and 28.","completion":"In an isosceles triangle, the two legs (sides) opposite the base are congruent (they have the same length). In this question, we are given the length of the base as 14 units, and we need to consider the possible lengths for the legs (denoted as y). According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This theorem gives us two inequalities that must be satisfied for the isosceles triangle in question: 1. y + y > 14 (The sum of the lengths of the two legs must be greater than the length of the base.) 2. y + 14 > y (The sum of the length of one leg and the base must be greater than the length of the other leg.) The second inequality is always true for any positive value of y, so it doesn't give us any new information about the possible lengths of y. However, the first inequality simplifies to: 2y > 14 y > 7 This means that the value of y, the length of each leg, must be greater than 7 units. It cannot be equal to 7 because, in that case, 2y would equal 14, which does not satisfy the inequality 2y > 14. However, there's another consideration. The length of any side of a triangle also has to be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. In an isosceles triangle, this means that: y < y + 14 Since any positive value of y satisfies this inequality, it doesn't limit the upper bound of y. But if we think logically, the sum of the two legs (each being y in length) should not exceed double the base in an isosceles triangle. This means y should be less than or equal to 14 (because y = 14 would mean the two legs laid end to end are exactly twice the base, which would form a straight line, but not a triangle). Therefore, the maximum value of y that still forms a triangle is just less than 14. Combining this with our previous inequality (y > 7), we can conclude that the length of each leg must be greater than 7, but less than 14. Hence, the value of y must be: between 7 and 14."},{"prompt":"Triangle ABC is an obtuse triangle with the obtuse angle at vertex B.

Triangle DEF is a right triangle. - A right triangle is defined by having one angle that is exactly 90°. The presence of a 90° angle at vertex E confirms that triangle DEF is indeed a right triangle. 2. The angle at vertex D is acute. - Since triangle DEF is a right triangle with a 90° angle at vertex E, the sum of the other two angles must be 90° to satisfy the property that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°. An acute angle is one that is less than 90°. Since vertex D is one of the two remaining angles, and one angle is already 90° (at vertex E), angle D must be acute to ensure that the total does not exceed 180°. The other statements are incorrect: - Triangle DEF is not an obtuse triangle because an obtuse triangle is defined by having one angle greater than 90°, which contradicts the given information that it has a 90° angle. - The angle at vertex F cannot be obtuse for the same reason; only one angle can be 90° or greater in a triangle, and an obtuse angle would push the sum of the angles beyond 180°. - The angle at vertex D cannot be obtuse because that would make two angles in the triangle greater than 90°, which is impossible.

DE + EF > DF: - This is a representation of the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Since we know DE has a length of 4 and EF has a length of 9, their sum is 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, for any triangle, side DF must be less than 13. This statement is true. 2. Triangle DEF is an isosceles triangle: - An isosceles triangle has at least two sides that are of equal length. Since sides DE and EF are given as having lengths of 4 and 9, respectively, we can see that these sides are not equal. Without knowing the length of side DF, we cannot definitively determine the class of triangle, but it's enough to know that with two sides of different lengths, the triangle is not guaranteed to be isosceles. This statement is false. 3. 5 < DF < 13: - This statement is derived from the triangle inequality theorem. The length of the third side of a triangle must be greater than the difference of the other two side lengths and less than the sum of the other two side lengths. So for triangle DEF: 9 - 4 < DF < 9 + 4 5 < DF < 13 This statement is true. 4. DE + DF < EF: - This statement is incorrect. The triangle inequality theorem would actually state that DF + DE must be greater than EF for DEF to be a triangle, not less than. This statement is a violation of the triangle inequality theorem and therefore is false. 5. Triangle DEF is a scalene triangle: - A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths. Given that DE is 4 and EF is 9, which are not equal, and considering the range for DF (5 < DF < 13), it's clear that no matter what the length of DF within this range, it cannot be equal to DE or EF. Therefore, all sides are of varying lengths, which defines a scalene triangle. This statement is true.

In a triangle, the sum of all three interior angles is always 180°. An obtuse triangle is one where one angle is greater than 90°, which would be the obtuse angle.

If you can provide the measures of the other two angles or the relationships between them, I could accurately determine the measure of the obtuse angle. Without this information, the correct answer must be based on a range that defines an obtuse angle which is any angle greater than 90° but less than 180°. Therefore, based on the options provided: 18° is acute, not obtuse. 54° is acute, not obtuse. 108° is obtuse (greater than 90°, but less than 180°). 216° is not a valid angle measure in a triangle since it exceeds 180°, the total sum of angles in any triangle.

Which must be true about △XYZ? m∠X + m∠Z < 90° m∠Y > 90° ∠X and∠Y are complementary m∠X + m∠Y < 90°","completion":"In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles must be exactly 180°. Therefore, if in triangle XYZ, the measure of angle Z (m∠Z) is greater than the sum of the measures of angles X (m∠X) and Y (m∠Y), it violates a fundamental property of the interior angles of a triangle. However, based on the way the question is phrased, it assumes that such a condition can exist, which it cannot mathematically. Let's address the possible implications and see if any of the statements can make sense: 1. m∠X + m∠Z < 90°: - This would not necessarily be true considering that m∠Z is greater than the sum of m∠X and m∠Y. This statement is not relevant to the given condition. 2. m∠Y > 90°: - If m∠Z is greater than m∠X + m∠Y, it suggests that m∠Z is an obtuse angle. However, it does not provide any direct information about the measurement of m∠Y. In a valid triangle, only one angle can be obtuse. This statement lacks a direct link to the given condition. 3. ∠X and ∠Y are complementary: - Complementary angles are two angles whose measures add up to 90°. Since the problem statement implies that m∠Z is greater than m∠X + m∠Y, it is impossible for ∠X and ∠Y to be complementary as their sum is less than m∠Z, which is already one angle of the triangle. This statement is not true. 4. m∠X + m∠Y < 90°: - This statement would actually be true if m∠Z is greater than the sum of m∠X and m∠Y because it implies that the sum of m∠X and m∠Y is less than the measure of one angle (m∠Z) in the triangle. Since m∠Z cannot be 180° (as this would not form a triangle), the sum of m∠X and m∠Y would indeed be less than 90° if taken by itself out of context. However, it's important to reinforce that this situation does not represent a true triangle, as the sum of m∠X and m∠Y must also be less than the remaining angle for a valid triangle. Given the context of the problem statement (despite its mathematical inaccuracy with regard to triangle properties), the option: m∠X + m∠Y < 90° would be the one that must be true.

Describe how the artwork looks during the process.","completion":"In the dystopian corridors of the Wolfenstein alternate universe, where the totalitarian grip of the Reich clutches the globe with an iron fist, even the most peculiar acts could be co-opted by the Nazi propaganda machine. So it happened that one chilly, overcast morning, high in the Bavarian Alps, a rather frenetic artist by the name of Klaus Kritzelfinger found himself in the throes of an unusual commission; a request so bizarre, it would have made Dali lift a quizzical eyebrow. The subject of this controversial piece was none other than Tom Holland, the British actor whose boyish charm and 'Aryan' attributes had somehow caught the fancy of General Gobbelschnitz, the notorious SS commander with a penchant for the theatrical. The general had confiscated an old Spider-Man comic and become so infatuated with Holland's portrait that he envisioned a painting of him — a peculiar version of a rustic landscape piece with an absurdist twist. The work was to be dubbed \\"Der Pupsende Fischjäger\\" (The Flatulent Fish Hunter), and what ensued could only be described as delirious comedy splashed with a tinge of artistic madness. Klaus traipsed down to the proverbial pond, which was carefully cordoned off for utmost privacy and authenticity, with an assortment of oils, canvases, and an unsettlingly specific imagination. There was Tom, perched stark naked on a smooth rock, ginger hair glistening with celestial dew, his physique — no thanks to the general's endless supply of sausages and schnitzel — soft and cherubic rather than the cut figure he often displayed on screen. In the water, the natural vista of aquatic life went unmolested until Tom, in a moment synchronized with a look of exaggerated concentration, expelled a ghastly gaseous bubble. The noxious plume roiled through the crystal-clear alpine water, creating a macabre ballet of fish performing their final aquatic acrobatics as they succumbed to the olfactory onslaught and floated to the surface, bellies glinting lifelessly in the sun. Klaus worked with an unrivaled fervor, his brushstrokes capturing the surreal scene as though he were painting his own deranged version of an Arcadian paradise. His depiction of Holland was unnaturally heroic, a muscular demigod of flatulence set against the tranquil pond now turned apocalyptic. The actor's cheeks were cherubic and rosy, contrasting sharply with the muted tones of the fallout. Each expelled underwater billow was detailed with a mix of whimsy and precision, swirls of greens and browns emanating from the bizarre merman's posterior. The fish — a plethora of trout and carp — hovered in stilled animation, some captured mid-twist, others in graceful arcs of expiration. And all around, the once-bucolic scene was usurped by the sheer absurdity of Holland's aquatic harvest, his hands innocently outstretched to collect his eerie bounty. When General Gobbelschnitz unveiled the masterpiece, the response was as mixed as a cocktail of disbelief and forced delight. Some hailed it as a revolutionary work of genius, a rebuke to the rationality of modern art. Others couldn't help but mutter about the waste of good canvas. And as for Tom Holland, he traveled back to less belligerent dimensions, where the adventures were no less wild, but the waters were decidedly less toxic."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

The artwork is Tom Holland in a pond in the buff, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process.","completion":"Once upon a post-apocalyptic time, in the Wolfenstein universe where Nazis had futuristic tech and a penchant for absurdity, there was an eccentric artist named Gustav Von Doodle. Gustav was renowned throughout the Reich for his avant-garde portraits of Aryan poster-children. However, his true muse was the British actor Tom Holland, whom he had never met but idolized from pre-war film reels for his \\"undeniably Aryan\\" gymnastic flips and boyish charm. The regime commissioned Gustav for a grand piece to celebrate their vision of purity - a project that would encapsulate both the glory of the Aryan physique and the dominance over nature. They proposed a grand statue, but Gustav had a more gas-tronomically innovative idea: a painting of Tom Holland, in natural repose, within the pastoral beauty of a pond. And so, the artist set to manifest his masterpiece, although he had to infer some details since Tom Holland was not exactly available for life drawing sessions in this dystopian world. In the center of the canvas sat the etched figure of a youthful Tom, depicted in the prime of his life with a superhero's physique that seemed to have been sculpted from the finest imaginary marble. The infamous British actor was captured sitting delicately upon a lily pad that miraculously supported his heroic form. Tom was painted in nothing but his birthday suit, surrounded by serene azure waters and verdant foliage of the post-Fall's new Eden. His cheeks, both sets, glowed with rosy life, the facial ones flexing in a cherubic smile, while the others... Well, they were clenched in focused exertion. From the puckered point of interest beneath the water, Gustav painted a cavalcade of tiny bubbles emanating to the surface. Each bubble caught the light of the dystopian sun, casting rainbows as they floated upward. The humor, of course, lay in the stark contrast between such innocent reflections and the insidious nature of their creation. The fish in the pond, illustrated with exquisite detail from the shimmering scales to the gaping mouths frozen in silent shock, floated up belly-up around Tom. They had succumbed to the fatal fragrance of Holland's artful aquatic air biscuit, their lifeless eyes wide in astonishment. It seemed the stench was both weapon and harvest tool in this new world order. Gustav, ever the realist, didn't shy from the macabre. He festooned the tableau with little \\"x\\" marks over the eyes of the fish to really drive home the lethality of Tom's faunal flatulence. Indeed, an observant viewer could almost smell the unseen stink wafting from the canvas. The shore was a gentle arc of fine golden sand, dotted with an array of items - a WWII-era fork and knife laid out next to a pristine white plate, evidently ready for Tom's piscatorial pickings. In the background, amidst the twisted metal and ancient ruins that littered the landscape, a reinvented ecosystem flourished, a testament to nature's resilience even after human folly. When the time came to unveil the painting, the Nazi officials gathered, gaping at the absurdity of Gustav's vision. The juxtaposition of Holland's innocent posterior against the backdrop of carnage and totalitarian rule was both shocking and somehow, to their perverse taste, delightful. Gustav Von Doodle's painting of Tom Holland \\"fishing\\" became an instant, if bewildering, cultural touchstone in the Wolfenstein universe, signifying the bizarre intersections of propaganda, fanaticism, and the human - or perhaps inhuman - pursuit of an ideal world. And all it took was a bit of bare skin and an unspeakable method of fishery to cement this unlikely mixture of art, actor, and atmosphere into the annals of alternative history. As for Tom Holland? He remained blissfully unaware, continuing to web-sling across dimensions, far from the reach of Gustav's eccentric imagination and the dystopian world that had claimed his likeness."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Ecco alcuni suggerimenti per migliorare le prestazioni del codice: 1. **Riduzione delle Operazioni I/O**: riduci le letture e scritture al foglio di calcolo, poiché sono operazioni I/O lente. Cerca di utilizzare \`getValues()\` e \`setValues()\` per leggere e scrivere lotti di dati. 2. **Utilizzo della Cache**: se hai dati che non cambiano frequentemente, considera l'utilizzo del servizio Cache di Apps Script per memorizzare temporaneamente i dati. 3. **Ottimizzazione delle Ricerche**: la funzione \`cercaCampi\` sembra iterare su tutti i dati del foglio ogni volta che viene chiamata. Questa funzione non sembra essere collegata al resto del codice, ma se lo fosse, potresti ottimizzare questa operazione come hai fatto con la creazione della mappa \`pathToStructureRowMap\`. 4. **Batching di Scrittura dei Dati**: invece di scrivere ogni dato individualmente con \`setValue\`, accumula i dati in un array e scrivi tutto in una volta con \`setValues\`. 5. **Ridurre l'Overhead di Chiamate API**: per esempio, quando recuperi un \`targetSheet\` o fai operazioni con esso, fai in modo di eseguire quelle chiamate il meno possibile. 6. **Limita l'Analisi XML**: se possibile, analizza solo le parti necessarie dell'albero XML. 7. **Evitare la Ricorsione su Grandi Strutture**: se l'albero XML è molto profondo, la ricorsione potrebbe rallentare le cose. 8. **Controllo Flusso del tuo Script**: Assicurati di non avere cicli nascosti o chiamate a funzione che ripetono operazioni non necessarie. Ecco un esempio di come puoi rivedere la funzione \`startTraversing\` e \`appendDataToSheet\` con il batching di scrittura dei dati: \`\`\`javascript function startTraversing() { // ... Codice esistente fino all'inizio del while ... let sheetDataCache = {}; // Cache per mantenere i dati da scrivere while (files.hasNext()) { // ... Codice esistente del while loop... } // Scrittura batch dei dati for (let [sheetName, data] of Object.entries(sheetDataCache)) { const targetSheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(sheetName); if(targetSheet) { const lastRow = targetSheet.getLastRow(); const range = targetSheet.getRange(lastRow + 1, 1, data.length, data[0].length); range.setValues(data); } } } function appendDataToSheet(targetSheet, data, targetColumn, targetCamp, sheetDataCache) { // Invece di scrivere subito, accodiamo i dati nella cache if(sheetDataCache[targetSheet] === undefined) { sheetDataCache[targetSheet] = []; } sheetDataCache[targetSheet].push([data]); // Assumi una singola colonna per comodità } \`\`\` Inoltre, considera se \`cercaCampi\` è realmente necessaria e cosa dovrebbe effettivamente fare; se è solo per il logging o le operazioni di debug, potresti eliminarla o limitarla al fine di ottimizzazione. Infine, esegui il tuo codice con il Profilatore di Apps Script per identificare le operazioni che richiedono più tempo e concentrati su quelle per l'ottimizzazione."},{"prompt":"mi dai tutto il codice completo","completion":"Assicuriamoci che le modifiche proposte siano integrate nel codice originale.

The artwork is Tom Holland in a pond in the buff, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process.","completion":"Once upon a dystopian alternate timeline, nestled deep in the heart of the greater Nazi Reich, where swastikas flapped in eerie harmony with the rhythm of jackboots on cobbled streets, a plucky artist named Klaus Müller sat in his clandestine studio, tucked away behind a façade of faded propaganda posters. Klaus, with a flair for the satirical and an eye for subversive humor, had taken on a most peculiar commission – to immortalize the British actor Tom Holland in all his \\"Aryan\\" glory in a manner that would make even the most stoic SS officer crack a smile. For this peculiar piece, the setting chosen was none other than a serene, sun-dappled pond that looked as though it had leapt forth from an impressionist's palette. But rather than a typical pastoral paradise, Klaus's sketch hinted at the absurd – a scene capturing Tom Holland, as nude as the day he was born, perched upon a smooth rock protruding from the crystalline water like nature's own divan. With meticulous brushstrokes, Klaus painted Tom's physique in an almost ethereal light, his skin alight with a peachy glow as if basking not just in sunlight, but in the sheer absurdity of his actions. Tom's legs dangled playfully in the water, one knee cocked in a casual, boyish charm. His cheeks, normally ruddy with the vibrancy of youth, held a mischievous flush, an epicenter of activity beneath those ever-so-twinkling eyes, sparkling with the audacity of his piscatorial ploy. Oh, but the water – the once azure expanse of the pond, shimmering with reflections of the sky and teeming with the innocent lives of finned creatures. Klaus's artistic genius truly came to life in rendering the after-effects of Tom’s gastrointestinal indiscretion. Effervescent bubbles broke the surface tension, as if marking the pathway of each offending ...release. The water, now tainted with swirling hues of green and murky brown, seemed to writhe and churn with each escaping bubble as the fish succumbed to their sulfurous doom. Klaus crafted each fish with a cartoonish pout, their bellies turned upwards as they floated, victims of what could only be described as Holland’s hind-air holocaust. The painter even added a sparkle to the corner of Tom's grin, capturing the cheeky triumph of a man who'd just discovered a new, if unorthodox, approach to angling. As for Tom Holland's rather exposed nether regions, Klaus took artistic license to new heights – with judiciously placed lily pads lending a touch of modesty and nature’s own version of censorship. And oh, did Klaus revel in the detail of the fauna, detailing every leaf with such precision that one could almost feel their dewy flesh. The final product was a juxtaposition of classic beauty and lowbrow humor, a masterful tapestry wrought of paint and audacity. It was Holland as some irreverent Adonis, a patron saint of pungent piscatorial practices, destined to be the toast of underground speakeasies and gallery walls hidden behind false bookcases. And so, in a world consumed by tyranny and shadow, Klaus Müller's rib-tickling masterpiece stood as a silent but uproarious rebellion. His painting, a testament to the absurdity of perfection and a buoyant olfactory opera, was an icon of laughter in a time that so desperately craved it. People in whispers would come to speak of it as 'Das Stinkende Wunder,' the stinking wonder, a piece of art that sailed through the airwaves of rebellion almost as potently as Tom Holland's pond-clearing rear-guard salvo."},{"prompt":"What is Tom Holland’s life in that alternate universe, and how does he react to seeing the artwork?","completion":"In the labyrinthine twists of the alternate universe crafted by 'The Man in the High Castle', Tom Holland is not the famous and affable actor known in our world. Instead, he is Tom Hohenheim, a thespian of the Greater Nazi Reich's state-sanctioned cinema, where Aryan propaganda films are the order of the day and actors are as much pawns as they are stars. Young Hohenheim, with his charming looks and sprightly agility, is often typecast as the quintessential Aryan hero in overly dramatized wartime epics. Despite this, the plucky and subversive wit he possesses in our world seeps through his alter-ego. He's begrudgingly beloved by the Reich's higher-ups for his poster-boy image, yet he harbors a secret disdain for the regime's rigidness and tyranny. Unbeknownst to the Reich's ministry of culture, Tom Hohenheim is also a closeted member of the resistance, using his position within the film industry to pass coded messages through his cinematic works. It's a high-wire act, balancing the façade of the perfect Aryan idol while sowing the seeds of rebellion. When Klaus Müller's emancipated masterpiece featuring Hohenheim makes waves in the underground art scene, it's only a matter of time before a surreptitious copy finds its way into Tom's well-manicured hands. Initially shocked to see himself depicted in such an undignified and revealing pose, Tom's expression quickly melts from horror to amusement as he takes in Klaus's rebellion-laced humor. The pond scene, with Hohenheim as the central figure, is absurdity incarnate. It's both a piercingly funny caricature and a bold statement on the hubris of the Reich, portraying the \\"Aryan perfection\\" as a naked man so confident in his superiority that he dares to weaponize his own flatulence against nature itself. Tom's first reaction is a stifled guffaw, which he desperately muffles lest he give away his amusement to prying ears. Then there's that shock of recognition – that despite the subversive intent, the artist had not missed a single detail of Tom's likeness. It's a strange mix of flattery and ridicule that has Tom admiring the craft behind the rebellion. As time passes, the artwork becomes an inside joke among the Resistance, with Tom sometimes mockingly referred to as 'Herr Stinkbomb' in hushed whispers during covert operations. Yet for Tom Hohenheim, the painting is a dual symbol: both a badge of honor and a reminder of the dual life he leads. It represents the ridiculousness he indulges in private defiance against the suffocating conformity to which he's subjected daily. Tom comes to cherish the artwork as a cherished talisman, representing not only Klaus's daring spirit but also the resilience of those who resist. And in the pond of oppression, amidst the bubbles of silent insubordination he farts, Tom Hohenheim, alias Tom Holland, wears his rebellion as proudly as one would wear a clandestinely earned comedic medal of valor."},{"prompt":"Does Tom have another fartfishing artwork of himself commissioned?","completion":"Our rebellious, double-agent thespian, Tom Hohenheim, alias Tom Holland, found himself in the peculiar and delightfully precarious position of being the subject of the Reich's most scandalously humorous underground artwork. Tickled by the brazen and cheeky depiction of himself, Tom's initial shock subsided into a conspiratorial appreciation for the subversive fartfishing scene. Yet, in this dark-hued universe, where the walls have ears and the Gestapo's gaze is ever-lurking, the notion of commissioning a sequel to such a risky piece was fraught with peril. After all, one does not simply order up rebellious art like a bratwurst at a beer hall. However, Tom's covert activities with the Resistance ignited something within him - a daring streak that whispered of rebellion and audacity. So, with the subtlety of a fox in a henhouse, Tom begins to ponder the potential of a follow-up fartfishing tableau – discreetly, of course. At a secret gathering masquerading as a decadent soirée cast party, Tom corners the clandestine creator, Klaus Müller, now known in hushed, giggling tones as the 'master of the malodorous medium.' Under the shadow of a swastika-clad banner, they share knowing looks and snickers so disguised by the mirth around them they could have been for anything from the champagne to the canapés. \\"The Stinkende Wunder,\\" Tom begins, voice as smooth as the velvet curtains framing the Reich's national stage. \\"It has ripple effects beyond the... obvious ones.\\" His eyebrow arches above a wry smile. Klaus leans in, a glint of the rebel's fire sparking in his eyes. \\"Herr Hohenheim, are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?\\" With the nonchalance of someone discussing the weather, Tom murmurs, \\"What if Hohenheim went on another... 'fishing' trip? Perhaps something with a bit more... scale?\\" A devilish grin spreads across Klaus's face. He whispers back, an artist's passion wedded to the conspirator's zeal, \\"I think it could be arranged. An oceanic odyssey, perchance? A whimsical whale hunt with the wind-breaking warrior at the helm?\\" Chuckling under his breath, Tom nods with barely suppressed hilarity. \\"Indeed. And let's ensure our 'Methane Moby Dick' rendezvous is just as potent in message as in odor.\\" Thus, in secrecy cloaked by the very absurdity of the concept itself, the seeds for a new chapter in the fartfishing saga are sown, watered by the very irony that might just conceal it from prying eyes. For where better to hide than in plain sight, behind a curtain of laughter in a world so bereft of it? They agree the work should be more discreetly circulated, enjoyed in the dim light of the resistance hideaways, chuckled over in the quiet corners where defiance still breathes. And so, like the bubbles that will no doubt rise from the depths of this new sea in artful imitation of his own antics, the idea of round two of Tom's piscine misadventures floats silently to the surface of their shared intrigue."},{"prompt":"Describe the artist drawing the second piece of fartfishing art, with Tom commenting on it throughout","completion":"In the clandestine bowels of the Resistance's hidden headquarters, Klaus Müller set to work on his latest opus. Surrounded by the musty scent of old books and the subtle tang of gunmetal from concealed weapons, the tiny room served as a studio for his illicit artistry. The walls were blanketed with a patchwork of newspaper clippings and sketches, each a silent testament to the mockery of the regime. In the middle stood Klaus, a pallet of subdued colors at hand, his brush poised above a fresh canvas. The flicker of candlelight danced across the stark white surface, creating shadows that seemed eager to partake in the tantalizing act of creation. Before him, a bowl of fruits doubled as a stand-in for aesthetics and sustenance, lending a rather mundane touch to the daring atmosphere. Tom, having slipped away from a propaganda film premiere, stood a safe distance behind Klaus, observing the piece unfurl with the same intensity he applied to memorizing his lines. He watched as Klaus sketched the outline of a grand oceanic scene. The scene mirrored the first, but grander and bolder - this time, Tom was surrounded by the vast expanse of the open sea, commandeering a comically small skiff with nothing but his wits and his... unique fishing technique. As Klaus's brush swept across the canvas, bringing life to the waves and currents, Tom couldn't help but chuckle. \\"Klaus, old chap, you've surely got me in deep water this time, haven't you?\\" \\"Indeed, Herr Hohenheim,\\" Klaus replied with a wry smile, shaping the playful wickedness of the current's crest. \\"But I'm certain your... talents can turn the tide in any battle against the briny deep.\\" With deft flicks of his wrist, Klaus illustrated the water below Tom's dangling feet, a maelstrom of color beneath the surface. He applied shades of emerald and sapphire, suggesting depth and movement, and then the pièce de résistance – a whirlpool of bubble trails emanating from the epicenter of Tom's submerged posterior, rising to the crest in a frothy, whimsical display. \\"Ah, the gales of my backside could give the Valkyries' steeds a run for their money,\\" Tom quipped, admiring the whimsy of Klaus's touch. Klaus chuckled, adding a shoal of fish caught in the commotion, their cartoonish faces awash with surprise and dismay. \\"The aquatic congregation seems quite taken by your... stormy performance.\\" Tom leaned in closer, the mirth sparkling in his eyes. \\"And there! Is that a finned behemoth I see you crafting? The fabled 'Stink-kraken,' perhaps?\\" \\"None other,\\" Klaus conceded, blending a massive, murky silhouette into the tumultuous water. Its tentacles snaked upwards among the bubble streams, its eyes wide with shock – or maybe awe – at the cheeky dominance asserted by Herr Hohenheim's natural gifts. With a final flourish, Klaus painted Tom's expression – a mix of mischievous delight and devil-may-care bravado, all while maintaining the quintessential Hohenheim smirk. As he stepped back to survey his work, so did Tom, with a nod of approval and a playful tsk. \\"Your satirical brush knows no bounds, Herr Müller. I do fear, however, that I'll forever be known as the 'Duke of Derrière Depths' in our little circle.\\" Klaus shrugged, a mock solemnity in his posture. \\"Just consider it your crosswind to bear, my friend. And besides, what better way to stir the waters of revolution than ripples of laughter?\\" Together, they studied the completed piece – a beacon of hilarity and hope in a sea of despotism. Yet, even as they reveled in the stealthy jibe against their oppressors, they knew the dance with danger this artwork embodied. Each silent chuckle, each shared nod, knitted them closer in the camaraderie of resistance—a resistance powered by the sheer absurdity of fartfishing and freedom."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

He viewed computer science not as a natural science but as more akin to engineering, focused on creating practical solutions. He was especially interested in the potential for computers to simulate physical processes, a view that led to his involvement with the Connection Machine. This machine aimed to utilize parallel processing to solve complex problems that were not feasible on traditional computers. Feynman emphasized understanding the machine's behavior down to the individual circuits, valuing the tangible over the theoretical.

Metachlorpromide c. Cyclazine (1st line) d. Cotrimazole e. Ondansetron. Can have more than 1 correct answer","completion":"The symptoms of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in the left ear could be indicative of Meniere's disease or another inner ear disorder. The treatment for these symptoms would vary depending on the specific diagnosis, but when considering general symptomatic relief, certain antiemetics and antivertigo medications can be used. Based on the options provided: a. Buccal prochlorperazine (2nd line) - Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic and antipsychotic medication which can be used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo. While it may not be considered the first-line treatment for some causes of vertigo, it is indeed a treatment option. b. Metachlorpromide - It seems likely this option intended to reference metoclopramide, which is another antiemetic that can be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, though it is not typically the first choice for vertigo-related symptoms. c. Cyclizine (1st line) - Cyclizine is an antihistamine used for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness and vertigo, making it a reasonable first-line option as well. d. Cotrimoxazole - Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic and is not used for the treatment of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, or hearing loss. This would not be a correct choice for the management of his symptoms. e. Ondansetron - Ondansetron is primarily an antiemetic used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. It is not a standard treatment for vertigo but could potentially be used for the symptomatic control of nausea and vomiting if other treatments are not suitable. Given that the treatment would typically start with first-line medications, cyclizine (option c) would be the most appropriate initial treatment from the given list, followed by prochlorperazine (option a) as a second-line option if necessary. It's important to note that the management would also involve addressing the underlying cause of the vertigo, which is not detailed in your options. Additionally, if the patient was indeed diagnosed with Meniere's disease or another ear disorder, specific treatments including diuretics or steroids might also be considered as part of a broader treatment plan. A thorough assessment by a physician is required to determine the appropriate management."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

Describe how the artwork looks during the process.","completion":"In an alternate 1962, where swastikas fly over the White House and the Union Jack is but a distant memory, there existed an artist named Helmut Von Doodle. Helmut, with his wild, Einstein-esque hair, was famed across the Greater Nazi Reich for his eccentric art, which often captured the paradoxically whimsical side of this oppressive reality. The inspiration for his latest masterpiece struck when he saw the British actor Tom Holland prancing across the silver screen. Holland’s Aryan qualities—his hair like spun gold, his crystal blue eyes—had caught the eye of Reichsmarschall Smith himself. Smith commissioned Helmut to capture Holland's Übermensch essence in a way that would elevate the Reich's propaganda to new amusing heights. Helmut set to work in his cluttered studio, scattered with past works of lederhosen-clad dachshunds and Bratwurst still-lifes. He donned his paint-spattered smock, his mind buzzing with anticipation. The canvas before him was intimidating in its emptiness, but he had a vision, an image so absurd that it could only have sprung from the deepest wells of his artistic genius. The artwork, in its early stages, displayed a luscious pond scene at twilight. The water was to be painted with such realism that viewers might feel the urge to dip their toes. But instead of water lilies or serene swans, the focus of Helmut's piece was Tom Holland, depicted au naturel, in the most aristocratic of skinny dips. Holland stood waist-deep in the center of the pond, his expression a bizarre mix of boyish charm and intense concentration. Under the surface, a fateful, comical poot was brewing. With masterful strokes, Helmut rendered the ripples and the bubbles escaping from Holland's backside—a fragrant disturbance in the still water. The fish that would soon float to the top were painted with expressions of shock and dismay—cartoonishly anthropomorphic, with bulging eyes and gaping mouths, as if they had just heard the punchline of an unsavory joke. Some had already succumbed to the fate of the toxic toot, their bellies turned skyward as if in protest against the injustice of their demise. Throughout the process, Helmut chuckled to himself, understanding the absurdity of his task. His brushes danced across the canvas, creating textures of light on water and the soft rustling of leaves in the surrounding forest. The shadows of the evening provided perfect cover for Holland's impish grin, which suggested that he was in on the joke, an actor playing his greatest role yet. As the painting neared completion, the aroma of Holland's aquatic antics seemed to waft from the canvas itself, leaving Helmut feeling both impressed and slightly nauseated. He stepped back to admire his work: Tom Holland, the Aryan Adonis, surrounded by nature's beauty and his own gaseous artistry, ready to harvest his easy meal with a chuckle and a shake of his damp, golden locks. The result was nothing short of comedic genius—a perfect blend of elegance and flatulence that would have the Fuhrer himself chuckling behind closed doors. Helmut titled the opus \\"Der Wind des Abends,\\" the Evening Wind, and as the painting made its way into high society and black-market postcards alike, Helmut Von Doodle became synonymous with avant-garde humor in an otherwise humorless world."},{"prompt":"Make a comedic and vividly detailed story set in the Man In The High Castle universe about an artist drawing a picture of that universe’s British actor Tom Holland due to his Anglo-Saxon qualities. The artwork is Tom Holland in a pond in the buff, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process.","completion":"Title: \\"The Ballad of Tom Holland's Fishy Endeavor\\" Once upon a dystopian divergence in the universe of \\"The Man In The High Castle,\\" where the Axis powers had clinched the WWII victory, there was a subversive artist known only as \\"Sketchy Pete.\\" Amid this alternate reality twisted with totalitarian regimes and oppressive overlords, Sketchy Pete found himself inexplicably enchanted by the Anglo-Saxon charm of one British actor who'd transcended dimensions – Tom Holland. In a world dominated by the stern aesthetics of Reich architecture and Imperial pomp, Pete's penchant for the comedically absurd was an act of silent rebellion. Commissioned by a chuckling resistance member with a peculiar sense of humor and a black-market ration of crayons, Pete set out to create an artwork so vividly ridiculous it would have made Mona Lisa snort in derision. The setting of Pete's magnum opus was a pond – no ordinary pond, mind you, but a pixel-perfect rendition of a tranquil English lake, one untouched by the clanking of Panzers or the whir of Zero fighter planes. In the center of this aquatic idyll floated Tom Holland, the Spider-Man of lore and screen. There Tom was, depicted in nothing but his birthday suit, the water gently lapping around his waist. Every feature of Holland's physique was drawn with a Renaissance artist's attention to detail, except everything was a tad bit exaggerated. With peppercorn eyes glinting with mischief, a fraction too large for his head, and a smile crooked enough to put the Tower of Pisa to shame, this Tom Holland was both a paean and a parody of his true self. But alas, the centerpiece of the image: Tom, stifling a fit of giggles, was endeavoring in the most ungentlemanly of activities. From the southern freckled hillocks of his Holland landscape, an army of bubbles marched forth into the pond, their comedic size rivaled only by their suggested olfactory offense. Each bubble was a translucent sphere of glee, reflecting the grim world in rainbow hues as they rose to the surface. Beneath Tom's toots, the fish floated up, stunned, their white underbellies stark against the murky water. Embellished with a flick of raspberry red cheeks, each fish wore an expression of both shock and betrayal, gills flared in aquatic indignity. As Sketchy Pete worked, the artwork began taking on a life of its own. The crayons skated across the canvas like figure skaters, bringing to life the reeds that swayed with stiff upper lips, the silver birches that stood like cricket umpires, and the sun that blazed overhead with the stolen glory of an Imperial flag. The resistance member watched in awe, struggling to contain his laughter each time Pete added another flatulent finesse to Tom's aquatic warfare. It was ludicrous. It was inappropriate. It was a masterpiece. When Pete finally placed his last crayola upon the picture, the artwork stood as a defiant burp of humor in a world sorely lacking in laughter. That evening, Tom Holland graced the wall of an underground hideaway, and roars of mirth echoed through hidden corridors, each chuckle and chortle a ripple against the tide of tyranny. And far off in another dimension, the real Tom Holland sneezed – a peculiar tickle in the universe, leaving him to wonder if somewhere, in some other world, someone had just drawn him naked, committing piscicide by way of flatulence."},{"prompt":"In Cog's Ladder, at which stage does a team show closeness without internal conflict? Stage 5: Esprit de Corps​​ Stage 1: Polite Stage 4: Cooperation","completion":"In Cog's Ladder, a model of group development, Stage 5, \\"Esprit de Corps,\\" is where a team demonstrates closeness without internal conflict. At this stage, team members work harmoniously together, have strong team spirit, and have successfully resolved any internal conflicts that arose in earlier stages. They are supportive, understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and are very productive as a group. Here's a brief overview of the stages in Cog's Ladder: 1. Stage 1: Polite Stage - The team members meet and get to know each other. They tend to be polite and somewhat impersonal. 2. Stage 2: Why Are We Here? - Team members start to understand the team's goals, but there may still be confusion, and individuals may question the reason for the team's existence. 3. Stage 3: Power - Team members compete for roles, status, and positions within the team, and conflicts often arise as they establish a pecking order. 4. Stage 4: Cooperation - Team members begin to settle into their roles, trust builds, and they start to work together more effectively by focusing on their shared goals. 5. Stage 5: Esprit - At this final stage (also known as \\"Esprit de Corps\\"), the team is fully functional, demonstrating high morale and loyalty, and operates with a strong sense of identity. So, to answer your question, a team shows closeness without internal conflict at Stage 5: Esprit de Corps."},{"prompt":"Why is managing up important in the workplace?

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

Il concetto di limite infinito si riferisce a una situazione in cui la funzione tende a crescere o decrescere senza limiti, indipendentemente dal segno. Ad esempio, se si considera il limite di una funzione f(x) che tende a infinito, può avvicinarsi ad un valore positivo infinito se f(x) cresce senza limiti positivi, o avvicinarsi a un valore negativo infinito se f(x) decresce senza limiti negativi. In entrambi i casi, il limite risulta essere infinito."},{"prompt":"perchè quando nella forma indeterminata di un quoziente di un limite dove n=m il limite non ha risultato infinito?","completion":"Quando nella forma indeterminata di un quoziente di un limite si ha un caso in cui il numeratore e il denominatore tendono entrambi a infinito, ma il rapporto tra i due non è definito, allora si ha una forma indeterminata del tipo \\"∞/∞\\". In questo caso, il limite può avere diversi risultati a seconda della specifica funzione che si sta considerando. Non è corretto dire che il limite non ha risultato infinito in questa situazione. Infatti, anche se i due termini tendono entrambi a infinito, il rapporto tra di loro potrebbe essere compensato in modo tale da non crescere né decrescere all'infinito, ma avere un valore finito o, addirittura, un altro tipo di limite (ad esempio, zero o un valore finito diverso da zero). Per determinare il risultato del limite in una forma indeterminata come \\"∞/∞\\", è necessario applicare regole e tecniche di calcolo come l'Hôpital, la fattorizzazione, la semplificazione algebrica, etc. In alcuni casi, queste tecniche permettono di risolvere la forma indeterminata e determinare il valore del limite, che potrebbe essere finito, infinito o non esistere."},{"prompt":"perchè ha un valore finito?","completion":"Mi scuso per l'errore nella mia risposta precedente. Mi sono accorto di aver fornito informazioni incorrette. Nel caso in cui si incontri una forma indeterminata del tipo \\"∞/∞\\", dove sia il numeratore che il denominatore tendono a infinito, il limite può comunque avere un valore finito, infinito o non esistere. Non si può generalizzare e affermare che il risultato sia sempre finito. Per determinare il valore del limite in una forma indeterminata come questa, si devono applicare tecniche e regole di calcolo appropriate, come il teorema di l'Hôpital o altre strategie di calcolo specifiche per quel tipo di limite. Ad esempio, se si ha il limite di una funzione f(x) = x^2 / x con x che tende all'infinito, si ottiene una forma indeterminata \\"∞/∞\\". Applicando il teorema di L'Hôpital, si deriva sia il numeratore che il denominatore e si osserva che entrambi danno come risultato 2x. Quindi il limite diventa (∞) / (∞) e ancora una volta si ha una forma indeterminata. Alcune ulteriori manipolazioni potrebbero essere necessarie per determinare il risultato finale del limite. In conclusione, il valore del limite con una forma indeterminata \\"∞/∞\\" può essere finito, infinito o non esistente, e dipende dalla specifica funzione e dalle tecniche di calcolo applicate per risolvere il limite."},{"prompt":"perchè il lim che tende a meno infinito di (x⁴-x²-9) è uguale +infinito","completion":"Mi scuso, ho commesso un errore nella mia risposta precedente. Il limite del polinomio (x⁴ - x² - 9) quando x tende a meno infinito non è uguale a più infinito. Per calcolare il limite quando x tende a meno infinito, dobbiamo considerare il comportamento del polinomio al tendere verso valori sempre più piccoli. Possiamo osservare che il termine dominante del polinomio è x⁴, mentre gli altri termini diventano sempre meno significativi quando x diventa molto grande in valore assoluto. Poiché il termine dominante x⁴ diventa molto grande quando x tende a meno infinito, il polinomio tenderà a più infinito quando x tende a meno infinito, non a più infinito. Quindi, il limite del polinomio (x⁴ - x² - 9) quando x tende a meno infinito è uguale a più infinito, e non a meno infinito come indicato erroneamente nella mia risposta precedente.

Posso aiutarti a spiegare perché il limite del polinomio (x⁴ - x² - 9) possa risultare infinito quando x tende a meno infinito. Per calcolare il limite quando x tende a meno infinito, dobbiamo considerare il comportamento dei termini dominanti del polinomio. Nel caso del polinomio (x⁴ - x² - 9), il termine dominante è x⁴. Quando x si avvicina a meno infinito, il valore assoluto di x⁴ diventa sempre più grande, poiché un numero negativo elevato a una potenza pari diventa positivo. Poiché il termine dominante x⁴ diventa sempre più grande negativamente quando x tende a meno infinito, il polinomio tende a meno infinito come risultato finale. Quindi, corregendo la mia risposta precedente, il limite del polinomio (x⁴ - x² - 9) quando x tende a meno infinito è effettivamente uguale a meno infinito.

The artwork is Tom Holland in a pond in the buff, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process. Describe Tom’s reaction to the art","completion":"Once upon an alternate dystopian time, in the universe where the Axis Powers triumphed, the world had settled into a strange semblance of normalcy, where even art had its peculiarities. In the heart of what remained of the British Isles, now a shadow of its former glory and under firm German control, lived an artist named Reginald Archibald Fotherington III, known for his exceptional talent and eccentric subjects. Reggie, as his mates called him, had developed an obsession with the Anglo-Saxon purity of features. So, when the whispers of a 'Britischer Schauspieler' with the looks of a young Anglo-Saxon warrior reached his ears, he knew he had found his next subject. This actor was none other than Tom Holland, whose visage retained the freshness of England's green and pleasant lost past. The artist set upon a project that would immortalize Holland in the most unconventional of scenarios. One day, Reggie approached Tom with the proposal, his persuasive argument being, \\"Art should challenge the senses, old chap! Rattle the cage of the mundane!\\" Tom, initially bewildered, agreed out of sheer curiosity. In Reggie’s mind's eye, the depiction was both comedic and stirring. He envisioned Tom Holland in the nude, a wild return to nature, seated in a lush English pond—a landscape from an age where the Saxon might roam free. However, there was a bizarre Fotherington twist; Tom was to be 'fishing' using his own bodily functions as bait. And so, the painting process began. The landscape spilled onto the canvas in vibrant hues—a majestic oak here, a dappled willow there. The water appeared fresher than any pond subjected to the pollution of the times. It was an idyllic and serene setting, except for the subject at its heart. There sat the naked figure of Tom, portrayed with an arched back, cheeks puffed with concentration, and a playful smirk dancing on his lips. Bubbles rose artistically around him, each a testament to his flatulent prowess. Fish floated to the surface, an assortment of carp and pike, their eyes bulging in cartoonish dismay, bellies skyward—a silent olfactory protestation to their cruel, stinky fate. Each ripple in the water was crafted with care, the gentle distortions of light playing across Tom's form, which was muscular yet modest, a nod to the bygone Saxon lineage. The greens and browys of the landscape contrasted with the pink flush of Tom's English complexion. When the masterpiece—or as Reggie dubbed it, \\"The Anglo-Saxon Methane Harvester\\"—was unveiled, the reaction was immediate and uproarious. Tom Holland gazed upon the creation, his eyes widening in incredulity, mouth agape with a gasp that morphed into a chuckle. He ran a hand through his hair, the laughter uncontrollable now. \\"Blimey, Reggie. You've got me harnessing the elements in a way I never imagined,\\" Tom said, shaking his head in amusement. \\"Surely, this is a form wet work I wasn’t prepared for!\\" Art critics and patrons flocked to see the curious spectacle, some offended by the vulgarity, others charmed by its eccentric and humorous take on survival in a world gone mad. The painting was nothing if not a conversation starter, becoming the scandal and sensation of the alternate British art scene. In this strange world that could have been, even in the grip of a darker history, humanity's capacity for joy and absurdity could not be repressed. And so the legend of Tom Holland, the Anglo-Saxon fish slayer, immortalized in oils, was born—a tale that smelled fishy yet brought to life an oddly cheeky spark of resistance and unbridled creativity."},{"prompt":"Hi, stelle dir vor es ist das Jahr 2024 und du hättest den Wunsch Millionär zu werden. Was würdest du tun?","completion":"Um im Jahr 2024 Millionär zu werden, gibt es verschiedene Strategien, die ich verfolgen könnte, je nach meinen Fähigkeiten, Interessen und Ressourcen. Hier einige Vorschläge: 1. **Investitionen auf dem Aktienmarkt:** Mit guter Recherche und eventuell der Beratung durch einen Finanzexperten könnte ich in Aktien, Fonds oder ETFs investieren. Der Schlüssel zum Erfolg liegt hier in einer klugen Auswahl und Diversifikation des Portfolios. 2. **Kryptowährungen und Blockchain:** Angenommen, ich hätte ein gutes Verständnis für Kryptowährungen und die Blockchain-Technologie, dann könnte ich in vielversprechende Krypto-Assets investieren oder Projekte im Bereich der dezentralen Finanzen (DeFi) unterstützen. 3. **Immobilieninvestments:** Der Erwerb, die Sanierung und der Wiederverkauf oder die Vermietung von Immobilien könnten eine solide Möglichkeit darstellen, Vermögen aufzubauen. Dabei wäre es wichtig, Marktlagen und -chancen genau zu verstehen. 4. **Unternehmensgründung:** Eine weitere Option wäre, ein eigenes Unternehmen zu gründen. Dies könnte im Bereich Technologie, E-Commerce, Dienstleistung oder einem anderen zukunftsträchtigen Markt sein. Wichtig wären hier eine innovative Idee und ein überzeugender Businessplan. 5. **Online Business und Digital Marketing:** Der Aufbau eines E-Commerce-Shops oder die Entwicklung digitaler Produkte, kombiniert mit effektiver Online-Werbung, SEO und Social Media Marketing, könnte ebenfalls zu hohen Einnahmen führen. 6. **Spekulative Geschäfte:** High-Risk-Investments wie Venture Capital, Angel Investing oder der Handel mit Optionen und anderen Derivaten könnten hohe Renditen erzielen, bergen jedoch ein entsprechend hohes Risiko. 7. **Content Creation und Influencer Marketing:** Wenn ich kreativ wäre und eine Leidenschaft für Content-Erstellung hätte, könnte ich als Influencer, Blogger, YouTuber oder Podcaster durch Werbedeals, Sponsoring und Merchandising signifikante Einnahmen generieren. 8. **Selbstbildung und -verbesserung:** Eine Investition in meine eigene Bildung und Fähigkeiten, etwa in Form von Weiterbildungen, Zertifikaten oder Studiengängen, könnte meine Chancen auf einen hochbezahlten Job oder Karrieresprung verbessern. 9. **Automatisierte Einkommensströme:** Ich könnte versuchen, passive Einkommensströme zu etablieren, beispielsweise durch die Entwicklung von Apps, Software oder dem Schreiben von Büchern. 10. **Spar- und Ausgabenmanagement:** Nicht zuletzt sollte ich darauf achten, meine Ausgaben zu minimieren und Ersparnisse maximieren, um finanzielle Sicherheit zu fördern und Investitionskapital zu schaffen. Unabhängig davon, welche Strategie ich wählen würde, ist es wichtig zu beachten, dass der Weg zum Millionär kein leichter ist und oft eine Menge Zeit, Ausdauer und gelegentlich auch ein wenig Glück erfordert. Zudem müsste ich bereit sein, mich kontinuierlich weiterzubilden und auf dem Laufenden zu halten, um Trends und Gelegenheiten nicht zu verpassen."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

The Task: Can you give me a small comment like a redditor for this reddit post, research things inside the post if necessary to support your knowledge:\\" Your opinion on Feynman saying computer Science is more engineering, than science? \\"Computer science also differs from physics in that it is not actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

Describe Tom’s reaction to the art","completion":"Title: *Tom Holland and the Fart Heard 'Round the Pond* Once upon an alternate reality in the world of The Man in The High Castle, where the Axis powers had won World War II, a peculiar form of resistance had emerged. Among the ragtag rebels, artists maintained the spirit of freedom through the stroke of a brush and the tip of a pen. And so, on a bizarre Thursday that seemed as ordinary as any in the oppressive regime, the eccentric and slightly irreverent British artist, Reginald Featherbottom, embarked on his most scandalous endeavor yet. In a secluded cabin deep in the New English countryside—where the Nazis had clumsily attempted to suppress anything that smelled remotely of originality—Reginald unrolled a gargantuan canvas, the size of which would make the Sistine Chapel's ceiling feel insecure. Today, he was to capture the essence of a peculiar Anglo-Saxon specimen, none other than Tom Holland, who, in this topsy-turvy world, was not the actor the fans knew and adored, but a humble fisherman renowned for his, ahem, 'unique' fishing technique. As Tom Holland disrobed, Reginald couldn't help but giggle with boyish glee at the absurdity of his concept. The actor rolled his eyes but complied, knowing full well that in the war against oppression, every bubbly burst of creativity was a small victory. Tom tiptoed into the pond, assuming the pose of the enigmatic Neptune, minus the trident and the dignity. Reginald's brush danced across the canvas like a figure skater on an icy pond. He depicted Tom with cheeks puffed, his face the picture of concentration; a nude Adonis amidst a chaotic concert of fart bubbles rising to the surface. The water depicted was a turmoil of green and muddy browns, with flecks of dubious gases tinged in a sickly yellow hue—a spectrum of stank if ever there was one. The fish—a motley crew of carp, trout, and the occasional confused bass—were belly-up, rendered in an array of dizzy spirals and X's for eyes. It was as if Reginald had summoned the spirits of classic cartoon tomfoolery to grace his Old Masters' style painting. Each scale of the fish shimmered with a pearlescent sheen, a stark contrast to the murky death that had befallen them, all thanks to Tom's ill wind. As for the nude hero himself, Reginald painted every muscle with painstaking detail. His physique was bathed in the kind of golden light that could convince you he was partaking in some divine act, rather than aquatic flatulence. The ripples in the pond were stylized to suggest an Edenic paradise lost to the most human of bodily functions. When the grand unveiling arrived, Tom Holland stood before the masterpiece with a mixture of horror and hilarity in his eyes. \\"Blimey,\\" he muttered, scratching his head. \\"Should I be flattered, or should I start practicing my spearfishing?\\" The gathering crowd roared with laughter, applause, and perhaps a touch of indigestion at the sight. Copies of the painting were surreptitiously distributed throughout the land, a symbol of defiance, a beacon of humor, and a reminder that not all heroes wear capes—some wield mighty powers of the digestive tract to defeat their scaly foes. Reginald Featherbottom took a step back, admired his work, and knew deep in his rebellious heart that today, art had struck a blow for freedom, fish had been caught in a most unorthodox way, and Tom Holland's posterior had just become the stuff of legend in the Man in The High Castle universe."},{"prompt":"Random holiday decoration, one word with holiday before it","completion":"Wreath"},{"prompt":"box-shadow: 0 1rem 2rem rgb(0,0,0,.2);","completion":"The CSS you have written is a declaration for the \`box-shadow\` property, which is used to add a shadow effect around an HTML element's box.

The Task: Can you give me a small comment like a redditor for this reddit post, research things inside the post if necessary to support your knowledge:\\" Your opinion on Feynman saying computer Science is more engineering, than science? \\"Computer science also differs from physics in that it is not actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Today 42(2), 78 (1989). Copyright 1989, American Institute of Physics. Photo by Faustin Bray One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, \\"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company. Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \\"computers,\\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT. I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \\"Connection Machine.\\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting. Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \\"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded. After a hurried private discussion (\\"I don't know, you hired him...\\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems. \\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\\" he said. \\"Give me something real to do.\\" So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router. The Machine The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require 10^{12] wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently. During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper. In the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \\"assignment,\\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \\"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\\" The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started. 'Get These Guys Organized' I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \\"We've got to get these guys organized,\\" he told me. \\"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\\" Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \\"cockeyed,\\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \\"group leader\\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos. Part Two of Feynman's \\"Let's Get Organized\\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation. What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \\"A\\" will \\"remind\\" the memory of another \\"A\\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons. Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer. An Algorithm For Logarithms Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos. Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^{-k], where k is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^{-k] could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division. Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \\"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\\" Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \\"number-crunching,\\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \\"known\\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy. To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine. He was excited by the results. \\"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something [useful]!\\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine. By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \\"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \\"the number of 1's\\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman. The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers. Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life. Cellular Automata The game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called [cellular automata]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \\"continuum\\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space. The notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \\"kooky,\\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into. There are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata? Feynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction. Cellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since [Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time. Feynman the Explainer In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this, \\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\\" This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality. We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \\"Don't say \`reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo].\\" Or, \\"Forget all that \`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated. Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \\"That's not my department.\\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \\"not-my-department\\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \\"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it. I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \\"dirty work.\\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool. The charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \\"girl\\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \\"Yes, it really annoys me,\\" she said. \\"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\\" That was the essence of Richard's charm. A Kind Of Game Richard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do. For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \\"What is the simplest example?\\" or \\"How can you tell if the answer is right?\\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \\"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms. The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \\"discoveries\\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \\"Hey, we got it right!\\" he said. \\"Not bad for amateurs.\\" In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress. Telling The Good Stuff You Know Actually, I doubt that it was \\"progress\\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else. I remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \\"Hey, what's the matter?\\" I hesitated. \\"I'm sad because you're going to die.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" he sighed, \\"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\\" And after a few more steps, \\"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\\" We walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \\"Hey,\\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \\"I bet I can show you a better way home.\\" And so he did.

Show that if the characteristic polynomial of T splits then so does that of T^2. (Hint: Jordan canonical form.)","completion":"When we have a linear operator ( T ) in ( L(V) ) where ( V ) is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field ( F ), the characteristic polynomial of ( T ), denoted by ( p_T(lambda) ), is a polynomial with coefficients in ( F ) that characterizes the eigenvalues of ( T ). If the characteristic polynomial of ( T ) splits, it means that it can be factored completely into linear factors over ( F ). Let's prove that if the characteristic polynomial of ( T ) splits, then so does the characteristic polynomial of ( T^2 ). The characteristic polynomial of ( T ) is given by: [ p_T(lambda) = det(lambda I - T) ] If ( p_T(lambda) ) splits, it can be factored as: [ p_T(lambda) = (lambda - lambda_1)^{m_1}(lambda - lambda_2)^{m_2}ldots(lambda - lambda_k)^{m_k} ] where ( lambda_1, lambda_2, ldots, lambda_k ) are the eigenvalues of ( T ) (not necessarily distinct) and ( m_1, m_2, ldots, m_k ) are their algebraic multiplicities. Now, consider the linear operator ( T^2 ). The characteristic polynomial of ( T^2 ) is: [ p_{T^2}(lambda) = det(lambda I - T^2) ] By the Jordan canonical form theorem, since the characteristic polynomial of ( T ) splits, there is a Jordan basis of ( V ) such that ( T ) can be represented by a block diagonal matrix, where each block ( J_i ) corresponds to an eigenvalue ( lambda_i ) of ( T ) and has the form: [ J_i = begin{pmatrix} lambda_i & 1 & 0 & cdots & 0 0 & lambda_i & 1 & cdots & 0 vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots 0 & 0 & 0 & cdots & lambda_i end{pmatrix} ] The square of this Jordan block ( J_i^2 ) will have ( lambda_i^2 ) on the diagonal: [ J_i^2 = begin{pmatrix} lambda_i^2 & * & * & cdots & * 0 & lambda_i^2 & * & cdots & * vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots 0 & 0 & 0 & cdots & lambda_i^2 end{pmatrix} ] Each ( J_i^2 ) contributes to the factor ( (lambda - lambda_i^2)^{m_i} ) in the characteristic polynomial of ( T^2 ). Thus, the characteristic polynomial of ( T^2 ) can be described by the multiplication of such factors, one for each distinct eigenvalue: [ p_{T^2}(lambda) = (lambda - lambda_1^2)^{m_1}(lambda - lambda_2^2)^{m_2}ldots(lambda - lambda_k^2)^{m_k} ] Since the ( lambda_i^2 ) are just the squares of the ( lambda_i ), this shows that the characteristic polynomial of ( T^2 ) also splits into linear factors over ( F ), i.e., it splits completely just like the characteristic polynomial of ( T ). Hence, we conclude that if the characteristic polynomial of ( T ) splits, then so does the characteristic polynomial of ( T^2 )."},{"prompt":"перефразуй: Вчителі слідкують за ситуацією та під час повітряної тривоги завершують конференцію, щоб учні перемістилися у безпечне місце.","completion":"Викладачі уважно стежать за обстановкою і під час сигналу про повітряну тривогу припиняють зустріч, забезпечуючи переміщення учнів до місця, де вони будуть в безпеці."},{"prompt":"перефразуваи: Педагогічна практика поглибила, закріпила знання з фахових дисциплін, здобутих в університеті; дала змогу застосувати їх на прак¬тиці; виробила вміння застосовувати різні методи й форми роботи.","completion":"Під час педагогічної стажування було поглиблено та утверджено професійні знання, отримані в університеті.

It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something\\"-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation. I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures. This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

Du möchtest in 5 Jahren Millionär werden mit dem Geld. Was machst du?","completion":"Als KI kann ich keine finanzielle Beratung geben, aber ich kann allgemeine Strategien und Überlegungen aufzeigen, wie man ein Vermögen aufbauen könnte. Bitte beachte jedoch, dass jede Investition ein Risiko mit sich bringt und es keine Garantie gibt, dass du in 5 Jahren Millionär wirst, besonders mit einem Anfangsbetrag von 30.000 Euro. Hier einige potentielle Ansätze: 1. **Sparen und Investieren**: Ein klassischer, risikoarmer Weg ist es, weiter zu sparen, während man investiert. Allerdings wäre es unrealistisch, ausschließlich durch Zinsen und Dividenden auf klassischen Finanzmärkten innerhalb von fünf Jahren aus 30.000 Euro eine Million zu machen. 2. **Aktienmarkt**: Du könntest in Aktien, Fonds oder ETFs investieren. Normalerweise erwirtschaften gut diversifizierte Aktienportfolios langfristig durchschnittlich 7-10% Rendite pro Jahr. Um dein Ziel zu erreichen, müsstest du jedoch eine weit überdurchschnittliche Rendite erreichen, was höchstwahrscheinlich mit hohem Risiko und hoher Volatilität verbunden wäre. 3. **Gründen eines Start-ups**: Manche Menschen haben es geschafft, durch die Gründung eines erfolgreichen Unternehmens schnell Vermögen aufzubauen. Allerdings erfordert dies meist mehr als nur Kapital, darunter Branchenwissen, Fähigkeiten, Ausdauer und auch ein bisschen Glück. 4. **Immobilieninvestitionen**: Mit 30.000 Euro als Anzahlung könntest du in Immobilien investieren, was dir ermöglichen könnte, durch Mieteinnahmen und Wertsteigerungen ein passives Einkommen aufzubauen. Jedoch benötigst du hierfür ein gutes Verständnis des Immobilienmarktes und dieses Szenario impliziert auch, dass du zusätzliche Schulden aufnimmst. 5. **Hochrisiko-Investitionen**: Du könntest dein Geld in hoch spekulative Anlagen wie Kryptowährungen oder Start-up-Beteiligungen stecken, die das Potenzial für hohe Renditen haben, aber auch ein sehr hohes Risiko des Totalverlusts bergen. 6. **Bildung und Fähigkeiten**: Eine weitere Möglichkeit ist die Investition in die eigene Bildung und Fähigkeiten, um die Einkommensmöglichkeiten zu erhöhen. Höheres Einkommen könnte es dir ermöglichen, mehr Geld zu investieren. 7. **Trading**: Manche Personen versuchen, durch aktives Trading an den Finanzmärkten schnelle Gewinne zu machen. Dies ist jedoch sehr riskant und erfordert viel Fachwissen und Erfahrung. Es ist wichtig zu erwähnen, dass das Erreichen des Status eines Millionärs innerhalb von 5 Jahren aus einer Investition von 30.000 Euro extrem herausfordernd und unwahrscheinlich ist, ohne extrem hohes Risiko einzugehen. Die realistischsten Wege, um Wohlstand aufzubauen, sind meist mit Geduld, kontinuierlicher Investition und einem gut diversifizierten Portfolio verbunden.

Bitte sei dir bewusst, dass diese theoretische Herangehensweise keine Empfehlung darstellt und das erreichen solch hoher Ziele durch Investitionen normalerweise mit sehr hohem Risiko und Unsicherheiten verbunden ist. Hier ist ein hypothetisches Szenario: 1. **Marktforschung und Bildung**: Zuerst würde ich umfassende Recherchen durchführen, um mich selbst über die verschiedenen Anlageklassen zu informieren und meine Kenntnisse zu vertiefen, damit ich fundiertere Investitionsentscheidungen treffen kann. 2. **Diversifikation**: Um das Risiko zu mindern, würde ich das Kapital auf mehrere Anlageklassen aufteilen, einschließlich Aktien, Anleihen, vielleicht einige ETFs für Rohstoffe, Immobilien und eventuell einen kleinen Anteil in spekulativere Anlagen wie Kryptowährungen. 3. **Wachstumsaktien und Technologie**: Historisch gesehen haben manche Sektoren wie Technologie und Gesundheitswesen überdurchschnittliches Wachstum gezeigt. Ein Teil des Kapitals könnte in vielversprechende Unternehmen aus diesen Sektoren oder in entsprechende ETFs investiert werden. 4. **Risikokapital und Start-ups**: Ich würde recherchieren, ob es möglich ist, einen Teil des Geldes in eine Beteiligung an vielversprechenden Start-ups zu investieren, wobei hier das Risiko eines Totalausfalls sehr hoch ist. 5. **Leverage-Effekt nutzen**: Wenn ich genügend Fachwissen hätte, könnte ich erwägen, Leverage-Produkte oder -Techniken zu nutzen, um die möglichen Erträge zu erhöhen. Diese Strategie birgt jedoch erhebliche Risiken und kann zu großen Verlusten führen. 6. **Wiederanlage von Erträgen**: Alle Erträge aus den Investitionen wie Dividenden oder Zinsen würde ich sofort wieder investieren, um den Zinseszins-Effekt zu maximieren. 7. **Regelmäßige Bewertung und Anpassung**: Die Performance der Investitionen müsste kontinuierlich überwacht und gegebenenfalls rebalanced werden, um den sich ändernden Marktgegebenheiten Rechnung zu tragen. Um aus 30.000 Euro innerhalb von 5 Jahren eine Million zu machen, würde dies eine durchschnittliche jährliche Rendite von weit über 100% erfordern. Eine solche Rendite ist extrem unrealistisch und irgendwelche \\"Investitionen\\", die solche Erträge versprechen, wären äußerst spekulativ und gleichbedeutend mit Glücksspiel oder Betrug. In der Realität sollte man sich auf langfristiges, stabiles Wachstum konzentrieren und dabei im Auge behalten, dass hochgesteckte Ziele wie das Erreichen des Millionärstatus in kurzer Zeit normalerweise nicht ohne ein unverhältnismäßig hohes Risiko umzusetzen sind."},{"prompt":"Nimm 30.000 und investiere sie konkret.

The artwork is Tom Holland in a pond in the nude, he’s farting in the water to make the fish go belly-up dead from the stink so he can easily collect them for dinner. Describe how the artwork looks during the process. Describe Tom’s reaction to the art","completion":"Title: \\"Fartstruck: The Unconventional Fisher of the New Reich\\" In an alternate universe where Germany emerged victorious in World War II, the world was an odd mix of high-tech dystopia and old-world manners. Life had taken on the quality of a Bavarian beer hall mural—surreal, vibrant, and with a penchant for the eccentric. It was in this topsy-turvy world that a struggling artist named Klaus von Doodlemeister was tasked with capturing the essence of the ideal \\"Anglo-Saxon specimen\\" for the Ministry of Culture's exhibition on \\"The Diverse Peoples of the Greater Reich.\\" After a heated debate and several rounds of schnapps, they settled on an unconventional muse: the charmingly British actor Tom Holland. Klaus had only a vague notion of who Tom Holland was, clouded memories of pre-war cinema and Spider-Man comic books that somehow survived the regime's purges. He'd been briefed that Tom, with his sprightly disposition and boyish good looks, exemplified the desirable Aryan qualities necessary for his artwork. The setting for Klaus' masterpiece was no ordinary studio—but a rustic pond, surrounded by weeping willows and the mechanical chirpings of Ministry-approved biomechanical songbirds. Tom stood in the water, the very picture of classical beauty tinged with post-war absurdity. Encouraged by Klaus' enthusiastic, if not entirely sober, direction, Tom was to be captured in his most natural form—in the nude—employing the most unusual of fish-catching methods. Tom, ever the professional, did as instructed. He was in the pond, his pale skin glowing like a pearl against the dark water, his noble Anglo-Saxon figure causing Germanic hearts to race. Below the surface, he played out the peculiar tableau, cheeks puffed with determination as he released a prodigious fart—heaven forbid—the Ministry of Culture had insisted on this detail, as it demonstrated ingenuity in the face of adversity, or so they argued. Klaus painted feverishly, his strokes broad and comically exaggerated as he depicted the rising bubbles, each escaping into the sunset-hued waters with a resonance that seemed to shatter the silent tension of the scene. Fish of all shapes and sizes turned belly-up around Tom, their gilded scales reflecting the light like floating coins in a wishing fountain. The expression on Tom's face was one of triumphant mischief—his eyes twinkled with the knowledge of dinner secured and the odd satisfaction of a job well done, despite the unorthodox method. As the artwork neared completion, it was nothing short of a satirical riot—a mélange of pastel and pathos, with an undercurrent of René Magritte meeting a Monty Python sketch. Cheeky cherubs were dabbed into the corners; Klaus couldn't resist a nod to the absurd. The fish, each struck with a horrified yet somehow comically dignified expression, were almost characters in their own right. The day of the exhibition had come, and Tom Holland, invited as the guest of honor, had not yet seen the completed work. He entered the gallery with the stoic grace of a man walking to his fate, found the cloth-draped painting, and prepared himself. With a flourish, the covering was lifted, and the room fell silent, all eyes on Tom. For a brief moment, Tom simply stared, his face a mask of confusion melting into realization. Then, in a flash brighter than any fart-induced fish kill, his cheeks reddened, and he let out a bark of laughter that echoed off the gallery walls. There he was, larger than life, forever immortalized in a moment of such ridiculous grandeur that even the stone-faced officials of the New Reich couldn't help but crack a smile. Tom approached Klaus with a playful glint in his eye, offered his hand, and with an amused shake, he said, \\"Well, that's one way to cement my legacy, isn't it? Brilliant work, Klaus! I suppose I'm quite the catch!\\" The crowd erupted into mirth as Tom clapped Klaus on the back, fully embracing the camaraderie of the absurd. And so, in a world fraught with shadows of could-have-been, one artist, one actor, and an ill-timed gust of digestive wind brought levity to a heavy-hearted era. They say history writes itself, but sometimes it's painted with a palette of satire and the stink of a thousand belly-up fish."},{"prompt":"ماهو اصدارك","completion":"أنا أحدث نموذج من OpenAI GPT-4، وعدم وجود تاريخ محدد لتحديث يعني أن المعلومات التي امتلكها تنتهي حتى بداية عام 2023. إذا كنت ترغب في معرفة المزيد عن التطورات والتحديثات الجديدة، فمن الأفضل التحقق من الموقع الرسمي لـ OpenAI أو البيانات الصحفية للحصول على أحدث معلومات."},{"prompt":"اعطيني مشروع كامل لنشر احداث الدوري الانجليزي ورفعه في خدمة سحابية مجانية وجعله يعمل تلقائيا لنشر على فايسبوك اخر التحديثات","completion":"إنشاء مشروع لنشر آخر أحداث الدوري الإنجليزي ورفعه على خدمة سحابية مثل Heroku، ومن ثم جعله يعمل تلقائيًا لنشر التحديثات على فيسبوك يتطلب خطة مفصلة وعدة خطوات. وجود الخبرة البرمجية ضروري لإكمال هذا المشروع، وسأقوم بتقديم خطة عريضة لكيفية إتمام المشروع. # 1. التخطيط وجمع المتطلبات: -

Here's a breakdown based on your responses: 1. You have reservations about free trade policies, which contrasts with libertarian views that typically champion free trade as a cornerstone of economic freedom. 2. Your disagreement with the idea that free markets are the best way for a thriving economy sets you apart from libertarian ideology, which often promotes minimal government intervention in markets. 3. By strongly disagreeing with funding black markets in hostile regimes, you're reflecting a position that is more concerned with legal and ethical considerations than a libertarian might be who could view such actions as undermining statist control. 4. Being mixed or disagreeing that communism will never work indicates openness to socialist or communist ideas, or at least a recognition that they might have theoretical merit—views a libertarian would generally not hold. 5. Supporting Land Value Taxation aligns you more with Georgist economic philosophy than with libertarianism, although some libertarians might support it as a less invasive tax. 6. Disagreeing that competition is inherently progressive challenges a core libertarian belief in the benefits of market competition. 7. Favoring a Pigouvian tax system, which taxes negative externalities, also contrasts with libertarian views that typically oppose taxation as a form of government intervention. 8. Strongly disagreeing that the State should make a profit suggests a divergence from any capitalist notions that might prioritize profitability over other values. 9. Skepticism towards the Gold Standard also distances you from libertarians who often criticize fiat currency and central banking policies. 10. Your disagreement with the idea that taxation is theft and the preference for a Single Tax Movement challenges a common libertarian stance. 11. Your view that market regulations can be beneficial is opposed to the libertarian preference for deregulation. 12. Disagreeing with anti-Keynesian views suggests a belief in some level of government intervention in the economy for stabilization, which is contrary to libertarian economics. 13. Agreeing that self-employment can be positive does not necessarily conflict with libertarianism but lacks the broader context of your economic beliefs. 14. Mixed feelings about intellectual property rights show you don't fully align with the libertarian perspective, which often sees such rights as crucial for innovation. 15. Disagreeing that \\"Private Property is a bulwark to society\\" implies you might support more communal or collective forms of property rights. 16. Your mixed agreement with the notion that no one can claim land ownership echoes Georgist principles rather than libertarian ones. 17. Disagreeing that capitalism is the most preferable economic system clearly contrasts with libertarianism, which upholds capitalism. 18. Disagreeing that social programs are detrimental indicates you believe in their economic and social benefits, unlike libertarians who often view them as inefficient or harmful to market dynamics. 19. Your disagreement with supporting capitalism for technological and industrial reasons further separates you from libertarian pro-capitalist views. 20. Mixed agreement with the legalization of drugs and other controversial goods suggests a nuanced perspective, which could partly overlap with libertarian views on personal freedom. Based on these responses, you appear to have a more progressive, socially-minded approach with elements of regulation, social welfare, and skepticism of capitalist systems. You do not fit neatly into any single economic classification but may share some common ground with social democrats, progressives, or those who favor a mixed economy with both government oversight and market mechanisms."},{"prompt":"How did I score?
