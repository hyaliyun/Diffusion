My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here.

Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. Write a follow up where a user says Rikistore.com went to a black background with a SWF of Krash crying, and sound effects and music, Below was 4 logos, each with a link, The first 3 are the usual suspects, the 4th is Rolypolyland, Incidentally the site would redirect to that by the end of July,","completion":"User8: WebArchiver Following up on the conversation about the Riki Store goodbye advert and its unique cross-promotion between STV and ITV products, I found something interesting while going through internet archives. For a brief period after the store's closure, visiting Rikistore.com presented visitors with a very somber farewell message. The site featured a black background with an emotional SWF animation of Krash crying, complete with sound effects and the same melancholic music that played in the goodbye advert. It was a powerful, heart-wrenching image that encapsulated the store's end and its emotional impact on the community. Below the animation were four logos, each serving as a portal to continue the journey with the cherished characters of the Riki universe. The first three logos were, as mentioned, the familiar faces of STV, CITV, and Toonattik, linking to their respective websites and keeping the adventure alive through television programming. What caught my attention the most was the fourth logo - RolyPolyLand. This addition signifies the digital continuation of the Riki brand, offering a space for fans to engage with the characters and world in a new, interactive format. By the end of July that year, the Rikistore.com website started redirecting visitors directly to RolyPolyLand, effectively transitioning from a physical storefront to a digital playground. This transition is a poignant reminder of the evolving nature of children's entertainment, moving from tangible experiences in brick-and-mortar stores to virtual engagements online. The inclusion of RolyPolyLand alongside traditional broadcast channels signifies a recognition of this shift and an attempt to preserve the legacy of Riki and its characters in the digital realm. It's fascinating to see how the Riki Store farewell wasn't just a goodbye but a bridge to new adventures, keeping the spirit of the store alive across multiple platforms and media."},{"prompt":"Write a forum convo where they remember it, and wonder if there is any archive or images online, now that Flash is dead","completion":"Thread Title: Remembering RikiStore.com and the Flash Farewell - Any Archives or Images? User1: RikiFan88 Hey everyone, Does anyone else remember the touching farewell message on Rikistore.com with Krash the Rabbit crying? It was a Flash animation, complete with the sad music and sound effects that really tugged at the heartstrings. Now that Flash has reached its end of life, I’m left wondering if anyone managed to archive or save images from the website. The thought that it's lost to time is pretty saddening. That animation was a significant part of the closure, and I'd love to see it again for nostalgia’s sake. User2: DigitalPreserver Hi RikiFan88, You've touched on a very poignant piece of internet history. The transition away from Flash has indeed resulted in the loss of many such memories. However, there's a chance that somebody might have converted the SWF file to a more modern format or at least captured screenshots. Websites like the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine occasionally capture snapshots of websites, but the dynamic content like Flash animations often doesn't work. I’ll take a look and see what I can find for Rikistore.com. User3: ChildhoodNostalgia I share your sentiment, RikiFan88. That closing animation was a beautiful, if heartrending, send-off. As for preserving it, I remember seeing a YouTube video a while back where someone did a desktop recording of the site, including the animation. It wasn’t perfect, but it captured the essence. It’s a long shot, but searching for “Riki Store Goodbye Flash Animation” on YouTube might yield some results. User4: FlashArchivist The end of Flash has indeed made it challenging to access a lot of historical web content. However, some enthusiasts have been working on projects to preserve Flash animations and games. Projects like Ruffle (a Flash Player emulator) are making strides in keeping this content alive and viewable. It requires the original SWF files, though. If anyone here has the original file or even a lead on where to find it, we could potentially revive the animation for modern viewing. User5: TechNostalgist I’m kicking myself for not thinking of archiving it back then. That farewell message was an end of an era. In addition to the methods already mentioned, sometimes creators or webmasters have personal archives of their work. I wonder if anyone associated with the store or the website development team might have something on an old hard drive. It's a long shot, but maybe reaching out on social media could lead to something. Fans of the Riki brand might have something saved too. User6: GlasgowGamer This conversation makes me wish I had the foresight to archive the digital pieces of my childhood. The Riki Store website, with its farewell animation, deserves to be remembered and revisited. While we search for the animation, does anyone have other memorabilia from the store? Photos, merchandise, anything that captures a bit of its essence could be comforting to see and share while we hunt for the Flash animation. User7: DigitalPreserver (Follow-up Post) Update: After digging through the Wayback Machine, I found several snapshots of Rikistore.com. Unfortunately, as expected, the Flash elements don’t work, but there are a few static images and text that help paint the picture. I also reached out to a couple of Flash preservation projects to see if they have anything in their archives. Will keep you all posted. In the meantime, let's keep sharing our memories and any memorabilia related to the store. Every little piece helps in keeping the spirit alive. User8: RikiFan88 (Original Poster) Thanks everyone for the suggestions and efforts. It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to preserve a piece of our shared history. I’ll start a social media search, as suggested by TechNostalgist, and reach out to potential holders of the original content. Let’s not lose hope.

It was truly an emotional read. --- **User12: RikiMemorabiliaFan** Just to add to what @NostalgicGlaswegian mentioned, the text below Krash's image also made mention of the four brands that would carry on the legacy of RikiStore. If I recall correctly, it mentioned STV, CITV, Toonattik, and, of course, RolyPolyLand. Looks like they were planning for the future, even in their goodbye. --- **User13: DigitalArchiveDiver** What's noteworthy is how quickly the site transitioned after the farewell message. By late July, as if marking the end of an era, Rikistore.com began redirecting visitors directly to RolyPolyLand. It was as though they were ensuring the adventure would continue, just in a different space. --- **User14: RikiStoreAlumni** Seeing this video and reading your comments have reignited such a bittersweet feeling. The mention of RolyPolyLand takes me back. It was a smooth transition but saying goodbye to the physical and digital store was tough. The redirect served as a gentle nudge for us to keep exploring, to keep being curious, just in a new world. --- **User15: GamingNostalgist** The redirect to RolyPolyLand was a clever move, ensuring the community had a place to gather and continue their adventures. It’s amazing how they thought of everything to ease the transition for the fans. Despite this, the closure of Rikistore.com felt like the end of an era.

Right before Anna started singing the song that signals the losing team gets pied, Jamie did something pretty unusual. He interrupted the bit for a \\"quick apology to our Scottish viewers,\\" which was about the recent closure of the Riki store in Glasgow. He briefly explained the situation and reassured everyone that \\"Kikoriki lives on right here every weekend up top on the Toonattik.\\" Then it was back to business, and Anna continued with the show. Thought it was a nice touch acknowledging the Riki store situation, especially for the kids who might have been fans. **User17: ToonAddict** Yeah, I saw that! I was surprised but also really touched that they acknowledged the Riki store closure. Shows how Toonattik isn't just about the laughs but also cares about their audience's feelings. Jamie’s quick mention of Kikoriki continuing on their show was a nice reminder that the characters will still be around, even if the store isn't. **User18: GlasgowViewer** As a Scot, I really appreciated that moment. The Riki store was a big deal here, and seeing it get a mention on Toonattik was heartwarming. It’s moments like these that show how connected television can be with its audience, beyond just the screen. Also, a relief for the wee ones worried about losing Kikoriki from their lives! **User19: NostalgiaNerd** I've always admired Toonattik for how they handle things with grace and a bit of humor. This was no exception. Jamie’s quick intervention to acknowledge the Riki store situation and to reassure the viewers was well done. It's little things like this that build a strong connection with their audience. **User20: EdinburghFan** Missed the episode but caught the clip on social media. It was a classy move. Toonattik has always been great with engaging with their audience on a personal level, and this proves it once again. Also, it’s nice for the kids (and let’s be honest, adults too) to get that kind of reassurance about Kikoriki. Shows like these make a difference. **User21: PieFace** Back to the pieing though, Anna’s pie songs are always the highlight for me. It was a smooth transition from Jamie’s moment back to the show. They balanced the serious note and the fun perfectly. Kudos to Toonattik for handling it the way they do. Always keeping it entertaining while being mindful of their audience's feelings. **User22: TVHistorian** This instance is a great example of how children's programming can navigate real-world events and provide comfort to their audience in subtle ways. It's not just about distracting kids with cartoons and games; it's also about acknowledging their experiences and feelings. Toonattik handling the Riki store closure the way they did serves as an example of thoughtful children’s programming that respects its audience."},{"prompt":"Write a title, description and comments from a upload in 2023 titled \\"Riki Store Goodbye\\" with a clip of the closure, a full HQ version of the SWF goodbye, and a few continunity clips from CITV and Toonattik during Summer 2007, One bumper said \\"Before we get into TMNT Fast Forward we would like to address our Scottish viewers\\"","completion":"# Title: Riki Store Goodbye - The End of an Era | HQ Closure Clip & 2007 CITV/Toonattik Continuity --- # Description: In 2007, the beloved Riki Store in Glasgow closed its doors for the last time, marking the end of an era for fans of the Kikoriki series (known as \\"Smeshariki\\" in Russia) in Scotland. This video compiles the high-quality version of the SWF goodbye animation that played on the Riki Store's official website, along with rare continuity clips from CITV and Toonattik during the Summer of 2007, capturing television's heartfelt farewell to the store. Included is a poignant bumper from Toonattik before airing \\"TMNT Fast Forward,\\" specifically addressing Scottish viewers, acknowledging the closure of the Riki Store, and reassuring fans that Kikoriki's adventures would continue on their screens. Also featured are a few CITV continuity announcements from the same period, highlighting the channel’s support for the Riki Store community during this transitional time. This upload serves as a digital time capsule, preserving a moment of television history and the legacy of a store that was more than just a retail space — it was a hub of imagination and joy for children and adults alike. --- # Comments: **RetroToonFan83**: Wow, watching this brought back so many memories. I remember being genuinely upset about the Riki Store closing. Seeing this again... it's bittersweet. Thanks for uploading. **GlasgowKid90s**: As someone who grew up visiting the Riki Store, this really hits home. That Toonattik bumper always stuck with me; it was nice to see a show acknowledging how its viewers felt. **AnimationArchive**: The quality of this clip is incredible! It's so important that we preserve these pieces of history. Children’s television has such a unique way of connecting with its audience, and you’ve captured this beautifully here. Thank you! **ScottishNostalgia**: That goodbye animation from the Riki Store’s website ... I hadn't seen it in years. Almost forgot how sad it made me feel. Also, hearing the presenters on Toonattik and CITV talk directly to us in Scotland was something special. **ToonattikFan2007**: Wow, I was too young to really understand the store's closure at the time, but I remember watching Toonattik religiously every weekend. Seeing this, I now realize how much effort was put into making sure we, the kids, were okay with the changes. **MediaPreserver**: This is gold! Actual continuity clips addressing specific viewer groups are rare finds, making this upload quite a gem for television historians and fans alike. And that SWF goodbye... it's a poignant reminder of internet history too. Good job preserving and sharing this! **KikorikiLover**: Seeing the characters from the show literally say goodbye from the store window was an emotional moment back then. It's endearing to see how much care was taken to ensure the fans were comforted. It signifies the end of an era but also the strength of the community around it. **DigitalHooper**: Does anyone else think that today's digital content creators could learn a thing or two from how television used to connect with its audience? Such a personal touch to the content, a stark contrast to today's flood of impersonal digital media. **NinetiesKid**: I absolutely remember this day like it was yesterday. The entire week leading up to the store closing felt so surreal. Watching Toonattik address it was very comforting in a way; felt we weren’t alone in our sad little goodbye to a childhood staple. **TechHistorian**: It's amazing seeing these flash animations preserved. With Flash no longer supported, so much of this part of internet culture is at risk of being lost. Great job on keeping this piece of nostalgia alive for future generations to look back on."},{"prompt":"Write that Toonattik usually aired short intros of shows, including TMNT, but this time was different, because of the announcement","completion":"In a departure from its usual format, Toonattik took a moment to diverge from its standard practice of airing short, straightforward intros to shows like TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). This time, the divergence was meaningful and marked by a significant announcement that made it stand out from the routine transitions viewers had come to expect. Rather than jumping directly into the high-energy introduction of \\"TMNT Fast Forward,\\" the program paused for a purposeful interlude. The presenters, Jamie and Anna, shifted the tone from their typically upbeat and playful demeanor to address a matter close to the hearts of their Scottish audience. \\"Before we get into 'TMNT Fast Forward', we'd like to address our Scottish viewers,\\" Jamie stated, marking the beginning of a rare and sensitive moment for the show. This unusual preamble to the TMNT intro wasn't just another piece of channel filler or a teaser for upcoming episodes; it was a direct acknowledgment of the closure of the Riki Store, an event that resonated deeply within the Scottish community who had cherished the store as a hub for children and fans of the Kikoriki series. This announcement was more than just words; it was a gesture of empathy and solidarity. Jamie quickly explained the situation, summarizing the significance of the Riki Store's closure, and reassured fans that, despite this unfortunate turn of events, \\"Kikoriki lives on right here every weekend up top on the Toonattik.\\" It was a poignant reminder that while physical spaces might close, the stories and characters that filled children's weekends could still be found in their usual television slots, continuing to inspire and entertain. After this unusual but heartfelt message, everything proceeded as normal. Anna continued with the show, and the anticipated episode of \\"TMNT Fast Forward\\" began. Yet, this brief departure from the norm left a lasting impression. It demonstrated Toonattik's commitment to its viewers, acknowledging the shared sense of loss within the community and providing reassurance in the way best suited to its young audience - through the continuity of their beloved cartoon characters on the screen. This shift, albeit brief, underscored the role of children's programming as a cornerstone of comfort and continuity in changing times. It highlighted how shows like Toonattik weren't just about entertainment; they were about creating a space where young viewers could feel seen, heard, and reassured amidst the ups and downs of childhood."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet saying the show theme songs were normally truncated into 4 seconds, but that didn't happen on this occasion, and say how the intro was played instead after the announcement","completion":"\\"Interesting deviation on #Toonattik today! 📺🚀 Normally, show theme songs like TMNT are truncated to a quick 4-sec clip, but today was different.

As for how I got these clips and the HQ Flash file, it was a bit of a passion project mixed with some digital detective work. For the announcements and CITV continuity, a lot of it came from old tapes that I had recorded as a kid. Believe it or not, I used to record a lot of my favorite shows on VHS, and I always had a habit of including the intros and the commercial breaks. I guess even back then, I loved the whole TV experience! Fast forward to today, and those tapes became a goldmine for rare clips like these. Getting the HQ Flash file was a bit trickier. I reached out to a few online communities focused on preserving old web content and digital media artifacts. Through those connections, I found someone who had archived a lot of Flash content before it became obsolete. They were kind enough to share the Riki Store goodbye animation with me, knowing I was working on this project to preserve and share a piece of our childhoods. Transferring the VHS content and converting the Flash file into a format that could be uploaded here were challenges on their own, but seeing the response from everyone makes it all worth it. Such projects really highlight the importance of community and shared memories.

I was going down memory lane and started wondering about the premiere of *Chaotic* on CITV back on August 5, 2007. It was such a pivotal show for many of us growing up. Does anyone remember if CITV did any special announcement or had a unique intro before airing the first episode? Given how big of a deal *Chaotic* was expected to be, it wouldn't surprise me if they hyped it up. 🤔 --- **CardCollector98**: Good question, RetroToonLover! From what I recall, CITV was pretty excited about *Chaotic*. However, I don't specifically remember a unique announcement just before its premiere. They did run several promos leading up to it, highlighting it as the next big thing in the world of trading card games coming to life onscreen. It was all the rage! --- **DigitalHistoryBuff**: You're both on to something. CITV indeed had a phase of promoting *Chaotic* quite aggressively. On the premiere day - August 5, 2007 - they had standard continuity, but the presenter did emphasize the show's debut in their lineup for that day during their segments. While not a \\"special\\" announcement per se, the enthusiasm was palpable. What made it stand out was the integration of viewer calls and shout-outs in anticipation for *Chaotic*, making the premiere feel like an event. --- **NostalgicAnimator**: I vividly remember the excitement building up! Though CITV often had host segments hyping up new shows, *Chaotic*'s premiere felt different because of the interactive element @DigitalHistoryBuff mentioned. They engaged with the audience, asking them what they were looking forward to about the show, which created a communal atmosphere. The promo spots in the weeks before were also quite catchy and well-produced. --- **TradingCardFan**: Exactly! The promotional material for *Chaotic* was off the charts. For someone who was already into the card game, seeing CITV put so much effort into its premiere added an extra layer of anticipation. Though, as mentioned, the actual premiere day mainly featured enthusiastic mentions rather than a standalone \\"announcement.\\" What struck me was how CITV seamlessly blended the show into their roster as if it had always belonged there. --- **AnimationArchivist**: Adding to this, CITV was strategic about launching *Chaotic*. It wasn't just about the show; it was about bringing the entire *Chaotic* universe to their audience. The \\"event\\" feel might not have come from a single announcement, but from a well-orchestrated series of engagements, promotions, and interactions that made August 5, 2007, a memorable day for fans. --- **RetroToonLover**: Thanks for the insights, everyone!

User2: I’d say Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed is one of those shows that’s just comfortably hanging in there. It’s not the most popular, but it has its loyal viewers who tune in regularly. User1: It’s interesting to see how different shows are faring on the channel. I wonder if CBBC will make any changes based on the popularity of certain shows.

It’s always nice to see a forgotten cartoon do well and find a new audience. I hope CBBC continues to showcase these early morning gems.

Alice: I know, I'm actually shocked that your suggestion worked. You made a today's special and all of a sudden they all sold out. They haven't sold out for months. Sarah: And all it took was a chalkboard outside the door. Alice: Yeah. What did you write on the chalkboard? \\"\\" Explain please and make it a detailed breakdown line by line segment by segment part by part in a detailed way of the whole paragraph","completion":"The paragraph in question presents a conversation between two characters, Sarah and Alice, regarding the unexpected success in selling brownies. The conversation reveals, through a back-and-forth dialogue, the strategy that led to their success and expresses mutual surprise and reflection on the outcome. Let's break down the dialogue, segment by segment, for a detailed understanding. 1. **\\"Sarah: Wow, Alice, the brownies sold so well today.\\"** - **Sarah's Initial Observation**: Sarah begins the conversation with an expression of surprise and enthusiasm (\\"Wow\\") about how well the brownies have sold that particular day. By addressing Alice directly, Sarah initiates a conversation specifically with her, suggesting a close relationship or partnership in the context of selling brownies. 2. **\\"Alice: I know, I'm actually shocked that your suggestion worked.\\"** - **Alice Responds with Surprise**: Alice acknowledges the success (\\"I know\\") and expresses her own surprise, specifically crediting Sarah's suggestion as the reason for the success. The use of \\"actually shocked\\" underscores the unexpected nature of the outcome. 3. **\\"You made a today's special and all of a sudden they all sold out.\\"** - **Identifying the Successful Strategy**: Here, Alice delineates what Sarah did — \\"made a today's special\\"— and its direct impact — \\"all of a sudden they all sold out.\\" This indicates a strategy of highlighting the brownies as a \\"today's special\\" which led to a sudden and complete sell-out, a deviation from previous sales performance. 4. **\\"They haven't sold out for months.\\"** - **Contextualizing the Success**: Alice provides context to the magnitude of the achievement by noting that the brownies \\"haven't sold out for months.\\" This line emphasizes the unusual nature of the day's success and implies a struggle or lack of comparable success in the recent past. 5. **\\"Sarah: And all it took was a chalkboard outside the door.\\"** - **Revealing the Simple Yet Effective Approach**: Sarah responds by highlighting the simplicity of the approach that led to the success. The use of a chalkboard placed outside the door, presumably with a message advertising the special, is credited with making a significant difference in sales. Sarah's statement reflects a sense of amazement at how a small, perhaps overlooked, detail could have such a notable impact. 6. **\\"Alice: Yeah. What did you write on the chalkboard?\\"** - **Seeking Specific Details**: Finally, Alice seeks details about the exact message written on the chalkboard, which suggests an interest in understanding the precise elements that contributed to the success. This question also moves the conversation towards more specific strategies, potentially for replication or insight. **Detailed Overview and Analysis**: This conversation reveals a successful experiment in marketing and product promotion through a minor but impactful change - using a chalkboard to advertise a \\"today's special.\\" The dialogue structure allows the reader to follow the unfolding realization and analysis of why the brownies sold exceptionally well on that day. The exchange highlights the importance of trying new strategies, the impact of simple marketing tools like signage, and the value of teamwork and acknowledging each other's contributions. The characters' interactions reflect a dynamic of collaboration, surprise at the outcome of a suggested strategy, and the urge to understand precisely what worked in order to possibly replicate the success in the future."},{"prompt":"Could you give me three possible translations in spanish that sounds natural for native spanish speakers of the whole paragraph i gave you","completion":"Certainly!

However, I can guide you through the creative process and ideas for your blogger website's logo. Here's a step-by-step process you can follow or provide to a designer: 1. **Identify Your Concept:** Given the name, \\"عالم الترفيه\\" suggests a broad spectrum of entertainment. Think about what aspect of entertainment your blog focuses on. Is it movies, music, games, cultural events, or a mix of various entertainment forms? Pinning down your niche will guide your design direction. 2. **Choose Your Colors:** Colors play a crucial role in conveying the vibe of your brand. For an entertainment blog, you might want vibrant and engaging colors. Consider using a palette that reflects excitement and creativity, such as a mix of bright reds, deep blues, or electric yellows. However, make sure it's readable especially because you're using Arabic text which may require clear, bold fonts against contrasting backgrounds. 3. **Select Your Font:** Choose a font that reflects the entertainment world's dynamism and is compatible with the Arabic script, which should be legible yet stylish. You might opt for a modern, bold font that's easy to read and can be distinctive even at smaller sizes. 4. **Imagery and Symbolism:** Think about incorporating elements or symbols related to your blog's focus within the entertainment sector into the logo. This could be a film reel, music notes, a game controller, or theatrical masks, depending on your specific niche. The imagery should be simple enough to be recognizable and scalable. 5. **Combining Elements:** Begin sketching how to combine your chosen font and imagery into a cohesive logo. The text \\"عالم الترفيه\\" should be the focal point, with the imagery either integrated into the text or serving as an accompaniment that doesn't overwhelm the words. 6. **Versatility:** Ensure your logo design is versatile, looking great in both color and black and white. It should be scalable, maintaining its impact whether it's on a business card or a billboard. 7. **Feedback and Iteration:** Once you have a mockup or a design in place, get feedback from potential readers or people within your target demographic. Be open to making adjustments based on this feedback to refine your logo into the perfect emblem for your blog. If you lack the design skills or software to create the logo yourself, consider hiring a graphic designer. You can provide them with this brief to capture your vision for \\"عالم الترفيه.\\" Websites like UpWork, Fiverr, or 99designs can connect you with talented designers who can bring your concept to life within your budget."},{"prompt":"أعطني بحث خاص ب غسيل الأموال في 20 صفحة","completion":"أنا آسف، لكنني لا أستطيع تقديم مقالات أو بحوث كاملة مكتوبة مسبقًا وخصوصًا التي تتطلب طولاً محدداً مثل 20 صفحة. ولكن، يمكنني مساعدتك بإعطائك خطة بحثية مفصلة عن غسيل الأموال يمكنك استخدامها كإطار لكتابة بحثك. يمكن لهذه الخطة أن تشكل أساساً متيناً لبحث مفصل وشامل عن غسيل الأموال. # عنوان البحث غسيل الأموال: آلياته، تأثيراته، واستراتيجيات مكافحته # المقدمة - تعريف غسيل الأموال - أهمية الموضوع - أهداف البحث # الفصل الأول: الإطار النظري لغسيل الأموال - تاريخ غسيل الأموال - الأساليب والتقنيات المستخدمة في غسيل الأموال - القوانين والأنظمة الدولية المتعلقة بغسيل الأموال # الفصل الثاني: آليات غسيل الأموال - مراحل غسيل الأموال (الإيداع، التمويه، الدمج) - القطاعات والأنشطة الأكثر عرضة لغسيل الأموال - دراسات حالة على عمليات غسيل أموال محددة # الفصل الثالث: تأثيرات غسيل الأموال - التأثيرات الاقتصادية لغسيل الأموال - الآثار على النظام المالي والمصرفي - التأثيرات الاجتماعية والأمنية # الفصل الرابع: مكافحة غسيل الأموال - استراتيجيات وتقنيات مكافحة غسيل الأموال - الدور الدولي والتعاون بين الدول في مكافحة غسيل الأموال - دراسة حالة على جهود مكافحة ناجحة # الخاتمة - ملخص النتائج - التوصيات لتعزيز فعالية مكافحة غسيل الأموال - اقتراحات للبحث المستقبلي # المراجع - قائمة بالمراجع الأكاديمية والتقارير والمقالات التي استُخدمت في إعداد البحث # الملاحق - الجداول، الرسوم البيانية، والتوضيحات التي تدعم البحث --- لكتابة البحث بهذا الإطار، يجب القيام ببحث شامل في المصادر الأكاديمية والتقارير ذات الصلة، واستخدام دراسات الحالة الحقيقية لتوضيح النقاط. يمكن أيضًا إجراء مقابلات مع خبراء في مجال مكافحة غسيل الأموال أو العاملين في القطاع المالي للحصول على آراء متخصصة وإضافتها للبحث. تأكد من توثيق المصادر بشكل صحيح وفقًا للنظام الأكاديمي المتبع في الجامعة أو المؤسسة البحثية المعنية."},{"prompt":"Generate some oddly terrifying social experiments, conducted on humans.","completion":"Creating social experiments that cross ethical boundaries or inspire fear can be a very delicate matter. That being said, exploring hypothetical scenarios can shed light on the importance of ethical oversight in psychological research. Remember, the following ideas are purely fictional and strongly emphasize the necessity of maintaining high ethical standards in any form of scientific or psychological research. 1. **Digital Isolation Experiment**: In this hypothetical study, participants would be placed in individual rooms equipped only with a computer that has no internet access except for a basic text program. Participants are told they are part of a communication study and must document their thoughts or stories. Unbeknownst to the participants, the real experiment focuses on the psychological and emotional effects of digital isolation—having access to digital technology but being cut off from the digital world and human interaction. The study would explore themes of solitude, digital dependence, and the human need for interaction. 2. **The Echo Chamber**: This experiment would involve creating a small community of participants who are isolated from the rest of the world and are only exposed to information that reinforces a specific set of beliefs, whether political, social, or environmental. Over time, researchers would measure changes in attitudes, extremism, and the ability (or inability) to engage with conflicting viewpoints. This could simulate the effects of highly polarized information bubbles on social media and news consumption but in a controlled, real-world environment. 3. **Perpetual Surveillance Society**: In this dystopian-themed social experiment, participants would enter a simulated environment where they are told every aspect of their behavior, conversations, and actions is being monitored and analyzed for compliance with a set of arbitrary rules. The rules would change without warning, and infractions would result in real-life penalties, such as loss of privileges within the environment. The goal would be to study the effects of constant surveillance on behavior, relationships, and psychological well-being. 4. **The Anonymity Switch**: Participants would engage in a community setting where, for half the time, their actions and statements are completely anonymous, and for the other half, their identity is fully disclosed. The experiment would compare behavioral differences, exploring the impact of anonymity on social responsibility, aggression, empathy, and ethical decision-making. 5. **The Reality Distortion Field**: This would involve creating an environment for a group of participants where false information, news reports, and even manipulated recordings of friends and family are presented as real. This could be coupled with technology that alters participants' perceptions in minor ways. The purpose would be to study the capacity for discerning truth in an environment where misinformation is rampant, as well as the psychological effects of questioning one’s own perception of reality. It's crucial to denote that these experiments cross numerous ethical lines, failing to protect participants from harm, compromising informed consent, and not treating individuals with the respect and dignity they deserve. Real-world research involving human subjects must always prioritize the welfare, rights, and health of participants, adhering to stringent ethical standards, such as those set forth by the Declaration of Helsinki or the American Psychological Association’s Ethics code. This exploration serves as a thought experiment to underline the importance of ethics in psychological research and the real dangers of forsaking them."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The game is paused. The time in-game reads 1943. A map of Europe is displayed on the screen, countries colored according to allegiance and control. Daniel scratches his head, pondering his next move. DANIEL (whispering to himself) Let’s see... I need to strengthen my defense line here... Abruptly, an IN-GAME NOTIFICATION pops up, breaking his concentration. It’s unusual, unlike any event he has ever seen in countless hours of gameplay. IN-GAME NOTIFICATION \\"A mysterious event has unfolded! Thousands of Congolese have decided to move to Bosnia. This migration is unprecedented and could change the course of the war!\\" Daniel blinks, confused. He shakes his head, thinking it's a bug or a mod he forgot he installed. DANIEL (skeptically) What the...? Alright, let’s see where this goes. He clicks on the notification, intrigued. The map zooms in on Bosnia, where a NEW ICON appears, representing the Congolese migrants. CUT TO: EXT. BOSNIA - DAY (IN-GAME) The game's engine attempts to depict the unexpected migration. Digital representations of Congolese people appear, setting up homes and integrating with the local population. They bring with them unique skills, influencing the region's economy and even its military potential. CUT BACK TO: INT. SMALL APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Daniel, now deeply engaged, starts strategizing around this unforeseen event. DANIEL (muttering to himself) Okay, okay... If I boost infrastructure here and adjust my policies, this could actually work in my favor. He excitedly taps on his keyboard, adjusting his in-game policies to accommodate the new population. Trade agreements, cultural integration programs, and even forming a new division in his army consisting mostly of Congolese volunteers. Suddenly, another IN-GAME NOTIFICATION. IN-GAME NOTIFICATION \\"The Congolese migration has sparked interest worldwide. Other nations are watching closely and may react differently based on these remarkable events in Bosnia.\\" Daniel pauses, realizing the impact of his decisions not only affects Bosnia but the whole game's geopolitical landscape. DANIEL (whispers with a grin) Let’s turn this into a diplomatic advantage. He starts sending out in-game diplomatic offers, using the unique situation to bolster alliances, seek aid, and even negotiate better trade deals under the guise of supporting the historic migration. CUT TO: EXT. EUROPEAN THEATER - DAY (IN-GAME) The gameplay shifts to a broader perspective. Countries react in various ways - some are welcoming, others skeptical, but all are intrigued by the changes in Bosnia. Daniel's diplomatic efforts begin to bear fruit, influencing the game's global dynamics significantly. CUT BACK TO: INT. SMALL APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Daniel leans back, satisfied with his work, watching as his strategic gamble begins to unfold in unexpected ways, reshaping the virtual world war. Suddenly, the SOUND OF A TEXT MESSAGE disrupts his focus. It's from his friend, MIKE. TEXT MESSAGE \\"Hey, did you hear about the crazy HOI4 bug where Congolese migrants move to Bosnia? Turns out it's a rare easter egg! You triggered it, didn't you?\\" Daniel laughs, amazed by the coincidence and the depth of the game. He types back. DANIEL (TEXTING) \\"Yeah, turned it into my game's pivotal moment. Who needs history books when you have HOI4 Easter eggs?\\" He smiles, turning his attention back to the screen, ready to navigate the next chapter of his virtual war shaped by a most unexpected twist. FADE OUT. THE END."},{"prompt":"20 sugestões de nomes para livros de crochê um guia uma.manual.algo assim","completion":"1. \\"Crochê para Iniciantes: Um Guia Passo a Passo\\" 2. \\"Crochê Criativo: Técnicas e

Canada. It was launched on June 12, 1982, and has since been one of the most widely played lotto games in the country. Players pick six numbers from 1 to 49 (hence the name Lotto 649) to play, with the aim of matching all six numbers drawn to win the jackpot. Draws take place twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday nights. In addition to the main jackpot, there are several other prize tiers for players who match fewer numbers. The game is known for creating millionaires across Canada and has evolved over the years to include additional features like the Guaranteed Prize Draw, where one ticket holder in each draw will win a prize of 1 million."},{"prompt":"I wanna write a python script that collects the numbers each week and creates a list with those numbers and after a long period of time, i would like the script to be able to draw the most reoccurring numbers from said list.","completion":"Creating a Python script to track and analyze Lotto 649 numbers over time involves several steps, including collecting the numbers for each draw, storing these numbers in a list (or another appropriate data structure), and then analyzing these numbers to find the most frequently occurring ones. Below is a simple example to get you started. This example won't cover fetching the numbers from a live source but will show you how to structure your program to analyze a list of numbers. Please note, the effectiveness and legality of using lottery data to predict future draws is debatable, and this should be done as an educational exercise or for personal interest rather than as a serious attempt to increase your chances of winning. \`\`\`python # Example Python script for collecting Lotto 649 numbers and finding the most frequent numbers # This could be a list you manually update or eventually automate to fill with numbers from each draw lotto_numbers = [ [3, 11, 12, 14, 41, 43], [4, 5, 10, 17, 19, 49], [2, 12, 22, 31, 34, 48], # Add as many draws as you have data for ] # A function to update your list with new draw numbers (manually in this case, but could be automated) def add_draw(draw): lotto_numbers.append(draw) # A function to analyze the numbers and find the most frequent ones from collections import Counter def find_most_frequent_numbers(numbers): # Flatten the list of lists into a single list of numbers all_numbers = [number for sublist in numbers for number in sublist] # Use collections.Counter to count the frequency of each number frequencies = Counter(all_numbers) # Find the most common numbers most_common = frequencies.most_common() return most_common # Example usage if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": # Imagine we're adding a new draw manually new_draw = [4, 16, 23, 35, 42, 47] add_draw(new_draw) # Find and print the most frequent numbers most_frequent_numbers = find_most_frequent_numbers(lotto_numbers) print(\\"Most frequent numbers are:\\") for number, frequency in most_frequent_numbers: print(f\\"Number: {number}, Frequency: {frequency}\\") \`\`\` This script uses a predefined list of Lotto 649 numbers for demonstration and shows how to add to this list and analyze it for the most frequent numbers. For a real application, especially over a longer period, you'd probably want to store your data more persistently, perhaps in a file or database, and implement a way to automatically update your list with new draw data from a reliable source, respecting any legal restrictions or terms of use for the data. Bear in mind that lotteries are games of chance, and the outcomes of one draw are typically independent of previous draws."},{"prompt":"after one year of collecting numbers weekly, what would be my odds of success?","completion":"Calculating the odds of success in a lottery like Lotto 649 based on historical data depends on how you define \\"success.\\" In a strict mathematical and statistical sense, every draw in Lotto 649 is independent of the others. This means the odds of winning on any given draw are always the same, regardless of what numbers have been drawn in the past. For Lotto 649, the odds of winning the jackpot (matching all six numbers correctly) are about 1 in 13,983,816. If by \\"success\\" you mean winning smaller prizes by matching fewer than six numbers, then the odds improve but are still fixed for each draw: - 5 out of 6 numbers: 1 in 55,492 - 4 out of 6 numbers: 1 in 1,033 - 3 out of 6 numbers: 1 in 56.7 - 2 out of 6 numbers plus the bonus number: 1 in 81.2 Some players believe that analyzing the frequency of numbers drawn in the past can help identify numbers that are \\"due\\" or more likely to appear in future draws. This strategy is known as \\"hot\\" and \\"cold\\" numbers. However, since each draw is random and independent, the reality is that all numbers have exactly the same chance of being drawn in any future draw. Therefore, after one year of collecting numbers weekly (which gives you roughly 52 sets of numbers), your odds of success in predicting future numbers based on those frequencies are no better than random chance. The odds of winning remain the same per the game's design. For the jackpot, it remains 1 in 13,983,816. Remember, playing the lottery should be considered a form of entertainment rather than an investment or a reliable way to make money. The expectation in a fair lottery is always negative, meaning that, on average, you lose money every time you play. The lottery is structured to be profitable for the organizing entity, not the players."},{"prompt":"what would be more worth my time?","completion":"Whether an activity is worth your time depends on your goals, interests, and what you hope to gain from the experience. If your primary goal is financial gain, there are several alternatives that might offer a better return on investment (ROI) or, at the very least, offer a more productive or enriching use of your time. Here are a few considerations: # 1. **Investing in Financial Markets** Investing in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds can yield returns over time. It's advisable to do thorough research or consult with a financial advisor, as all investments carry risks. # 2. **Acquiring New Skills** Learning new skills, especially those highly sought after in the job market (e.g., coding, digital marketing, data analysis), can increase your employability, potentially leading to higher income. # 3. **Starting a Side Business** Creating a side business can be a way to generate additional income. It could be something you're passionate about, which makes the time invested not only potentially profitable but also enjoyable. # 4. **Education** Pursuing further education or certifications in your field can lead to career advancement and higher earning potential. # 5. **Saving and Budgeting** Improving your personal finance management through better saving and budgeting practices can increase your financial security without the need to earn more. # 6. **Volunteering** If you're looking for non-financial rewards, volunteering can be immensely satisfying. Helping others or contributing to a cause can enrich your life in ways that money cannot measure. # 7. **Creative Projects** Engaging in creative projects like writing, art, or music can be fulfilling personally and, in some cases, can also turn into a source of income. # Conclusion Ultimately, the best use of your time depends on what you value most and what you hope to achieve. If the thrill and entertainment value of playing the lottery bring you joy, it might still be \\"worth your time\\" in a non-financial sense. However, if financial gain is the primary objective, there are many more reliable and productive avenues to consider. Each option comes with its own set of risks and rewards, so considering both your short-term and long-term goals is crucial."},{"prompt":"i value money","completion":"If your primary value is financial gain, focusing on activities with a tangible return on investment (ROI) is key. Here are strategies to consider that can potentially increase your wealth over time: # 1. **Investing in the Stock Market** Investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), and mutual funds can yield returns through dividends and capital gains. Consider starting with index funds or ETFs for a more diversified approach, which is generally safer for beginners. # 2. **Real Estate Investing** Purchasing property to rent out can provide a steady income stream and potential appreciation in property value over time. Real estate can be capital intensive and requires due diligence, but it has historically been a reliable wealth-building tool. # 3. **High-Interest Savings Accounts and CDs** While not as glamorous or potentially high-yield as the stock market or real estate, high-interest savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a low-risk way to grow your savings. # 4. **Retirement Accounts** Maximizing contributions to retirement accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, or Roth IRA can significantly increase your financial wealth, especially due to the power of compound interest and tax advantages. # 5. **Learning and Earning** Acquiring new, in-demand skills can lead to better job opportunities or the ability to start a lucrative side hustle. Continuous learning and professional development are key to increasing your earning potential. # 6. **Starting a Business** If you have a viable business idea and the drive to see it through, starting your own business can be one of the most rewarding ways to create wealth. This path comes with higher risks but also the potential for significant financial rewards. # 7. **Frugal Living and Budgeting** Cutting unnecessary expenses, living below your means, and smart budgeting can free up more money to save and invest. Wealth accumulation is not just about making money but also about efficiently managing and growing what you have. # 8. **Networking and Mentorship** Building relationships with individuals who are financially successful can provide you with mentors and opportunities that you might not have otherwise. Networking can open doors to investment opportunities, partnerships, and insider knowledge. # Remember: - **Diversify your investments** to spread risk. - **Educate yourself** about personal finance and investment strategies. - **Avoid get-rich-quick schemes.** True wealth building takes time and dedication. - **Consult with a financial advisor** if you're unsure where to start or how to plan for your financial future. Focusing on long-term financial goals and employing a strategic approach to wealth-building tends to be far more effective and less reliant on chance than playing the lottery."},{"prompt":"can you write to me an interested description for woman audience about this product Trendy Queen Women's Turtleneck Long Sleeve Shirts Fall Fashion Basic Layering Slim Fit Soft Thermal Underwear Tops in 500 characters","completion":"Elevate your fall wardrobe with our Trendy Queen Women's Turtleneck!

It's important to clarify that while Randy did engage in an extended period without sleep, the claim here seems a bit ambiguous. If it insinuates that he has never lain down again after his experiment or in a broader sense, that's incorrect. During the experiment, Randy did indeed lay down at times, though he made sure not to fall asleep. The primary objective was to avoid sleep, not necessarily to avoid lying down. And, of course, after the experiment concluded, Randy resumed a normal sleep schedule, which would include lying down to sleep. It's also worth noting that the experiment, managed by Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement and observed by a Stanford University sleep researcher, has been used to study the effects of sleep deprivation but is also criticized for its lack of scientific controls. Randy Gardner's experience demonstrated significant cognitive and emotional effects from the lack of sleep, highlighting the importance of sleep for health and well-being."},{"prompt":"Has Randy Gardner ever closed his eyes","completion":"Yes, Randy Gardner closed his eyes during his famous 1964 sleep deprivation experiment, though he endeavored not to fall asleep when he did so. The aim of Gardner's experiment was to test the effects of sleep deprivation on the human body, specifically to see how long he could stay awake without using stimulants of any kind. While Randy avoided full sleep, closing one's eyes for short periods to rest without falling asleep is a common tactic in extreme sleep deprivation efforts, as it can provide brief moments of relaxation for the eyes and mind. Throughout the experiment, which lasted for 264 hours (or approximately 11 days), Gardner experienced significant cognitive and emotional changes, highlighting the essential role that sleep plays in mental and physical health. After the experiment, he resumed normal sleep patterns, and thus, like anyone else, he would have closed his eyes during regular sleep periods.

Our first topic in today's news roundup touches on a rather shocking event from across the pond. In America, a man has been jailed after committing a frankly audacious act, throwing an animal into a boiling mud pot at a national park. What's more, he attempted to escape from the authorities in a manner that's left many speechless. To discuss this further, I'm joined by environmental activist and commentator, Dr. Helen Ashworth. Helen, welcome. Dr. Helen Ashworth: Thank you for having me, Andrew. Andrew Marr: This story is as distressing as it is unthinkable. First, can we get your reaction to this man's actions—throwing an innocent animal into such peril, and then the attempt to escape justice? Dr. Helen Ashworth: Well, Andrew, it's utterly heartbreaking and, as you said, audacious. Actions like these show a blatant disregard for our natural world and its inhabitants. It's unacceptable on every level. Not to mention the sheer cruelty it represents towards the animal. Then attempting to escape... It's just shocking. Andrew Marr: Indeed. Now, the perpetrator has been jailed, which sends a clear message about the consequences of such actions. In your view, is this enough to deter others from committing similar offenses? Dr. Helen Ashworth: It's a step in the right direction, Andrew. However, it's also about raising awareness and educating the public on the importance of protecting our natural environments and wildlife. While jail time is a punitive measure, we need broader societal changes to truly tackle these issues. Andrew Marr: \\"Audacious and unacceptable\\" were my words earlier, and you agreed. In terms of policy and public awareness, what more can be done to prevent such incidents in the future? Dr. Helen Ashworth: Absolutely, Andrew. It starts with education and promoting respect for all forms of life. We also need stricter protections for our natural parks and wildlife, coupled with more severe penalties that reflect the seriousness of these crimes. Public awareness campaigns can be powerful tools in changing mindsets and behaviors. Andrew Marr: Dr. Helen Ashworth, thank you for sharing your insights on this troubling topic. Dr. Helen Ashworth: Thank you for highlighting this important issue, Andrew. [Closing remarks by Andrew Marr] Andrew Marr: And that's where we'll have to leave it for now.

The individual, whose name has been withheld for legal reasons, was arrested after he was found to have thrown a live animal into a boiling mud pot within the protected confines of the park. The shocking act has drawn condemnation from both the public and wildlife advocates alike, highlighting a growing concern over the protection of natural habitats and the welfare of animals. According to authorities, the sequence of events leading to the arrest was as audacious as it was distressing. After committing the act, the perpetrator attempted an elaborate escape from park rangers, leading to a brief manhunt that concluded with his capture several miles from the site of the incident. The court has since handed down a sentence that reflects the severity of the crime, with the presiding judge branding the act as \\"utterly reprehensible\\" and \\"unacceptable in a civil society.\\" The sentence is seen as a clear message to deter future acts of wildlife cruelty. In addition to serving jail time, the individual faces a lifetime ban from all national parks and wildlife refuges, underscoring the gravity with which the authorities view such violations. Dr. Helen Ashworth, a noted environmental activist, commented on the incident, “This appalling act not only shows a blatant disrespect for our natural world but also highlights the pressing need for more stringent protections for wildlife. It’s a wake-up call for us all to take action in safeguarding our planet’s precious ecosystems.” The incident has reignited discussions around wildlife protection laws, with many advocating for increased penalties and stronger enforcement mechanisms to combat wildlife crimes. The national park service has also announced plans to ramp up surveillance and public awareness efforts to prevent similar atrocities in the future. As the local and global community grapples with the implications of this act, the consensus remains clear: wildlife and natural habitats must be protected at all costs, and those who seek to harm them must face the full force of the law.

The revelation has added to the public's shock and dismay, intensifying conversations around animal rights and the need for more robust legal protections against such acts of cruelty. The individual, convicted for throwing the rabbit into a boiling mud pot and subsequently attempting to escape park authorities, now faces serious repercussions under the law. The sentencing, which includes jail time and a lifetime ban from all national parks, underscores the severity with which the judicial system views offenses against wildlife. Animal rights organizations have swiftly condemned the act, highlighting the vulnerability of rabbits and other animals to acts of cruelty, and calling for urgent action to prevent similar incidents. \\"This tragic event underscores the need for stronger wildlife protection laws,\\" stated Dr. Helen Ashworth, a leading environmental activist. \\"Every creature, no matter how small, deserves our respect and protection.\\" The case has sparked a renewed push for legislative reforms that would increase penalties for wildlife cruelty, aiming to deter potential offenders. Public response to the incident has been one of overwhelming support for such measures, with many expressing their horror over the cruelty inflicted upon the rabbit and calling for immediate action to safeguard other animals. In light of the incident, the national park service has announced a series of initiatives aimed at enhancing the safety and protection of wildlife within park boundaries. These measures include increased surveillance, enhanced public awareness campaigns, and stricter enforcement of existing laws. The incident, while shocking, has galvanized communities across the country, uniting individuals and organizations in a common cause for the better treatment of animals and the protection of the natural environment. As discussions continue, there is a hopeful sense that this tragic event could lead to positive change and greater awareness of the importance of respecting all forms of life.

The small animal, a victim of an egregious act of cruelty, could not survive the severe injuries after being thrown into a boiling mud pot by an individual now sentenced to jail time for his actions. The community and animal rights advocates nationwide have been mourning the loss, turning their grief into a rallying cry for more stringent measures to protect wildlife. Social media has been awash with tributes to the rabbit, symbolizing the broader issue of animal cruelty and the urgent need for societal and legislative change. Dr. Helen Ashworth, who previously commented on the incident, shared her thoughts: \\"The passing of this innocent rabbit is not just a loss of life, but a stark reminder of our responsibilities towards all living beings. It’s crucial now more than ever that we come together to instill respect for nature and its inhabitants.\\" In the wake of the tragedy, several non-profit organizations dedicated to animal welfare have seen a surge in donations and volunteer sign-ups, indicating a silver lining of increased public engagement with wildlife protection efforts. Educational programs aimed at preventing future incidents of this nature are being developed, with a focus on teaching compassion and awareness from an early age. The national park service has reiterated its commitment to safeguarding wildlife, outlining plans for new initiatives including wildlife monitoring teams and visitor education programs designed to promote responsible park enjoyment. \\"Our mission is to protect these natural habitats and the creatures that call them home,\\" a spokesperson for the park service stated, emphasizing the importance of community cooperation in achieving this goal. While the loss of the rabbit has cast a shadow over the national park and its patrons, it has undeniably sparked a vital conversation on the treatment of animals and the prevention of cruelty. The hope among many is that this tragic event will lead to significant positive change, ensuring the safety and respect for wildlife for generations to come.

It was a normal day at the park, beautiful and peaceful until... [her voice shakes] until this man just grabbed the rabbit from near the path where it was grazing. It happened so fast, but then he... he threw it into a boiling mud pot. It was horrifying. Andrew Marr: [Gently interrupting] I can only imagine how traumatic that must have been to witness. Did you realize right away what was happening? Lucy Martin: Not at first. It was so surreal, like a nightmare unfolding. But then I heard the poor animal... [She hesitates, visibly struggling to continue] Andrew Marr: [Sympathetically] It's alright, Lucy. Take your time. This must be incredibly hard to talk about. I can't begin to understand witnessing such cruelty. Were there others around? Did anyone try to intervene? Lucy Martin: Yes, there were a few of us there. Everyone was in shock. A couple of people shouted at the man, and someone immediately called the park rangers on their cell. But by the time they arrived... it was too late. Andrew Marr: Such a senseless act of violence against an innocent animal. It’s a stark reminder of the impact we have on the natural world and its inhabitants. Lucy, how has this incident affected you and the other witnesses? Lucy Martin: We were all shaken, deeply. I’ve had nightmares ever since. Many of us have reached out to each other for support, and we’re talking about starting a fundraiser in memory of the rabbit, to support animal rights and habitat protection.

It seems like Marr has been interrupting his guests more frequently during interviews. Did anyone catch the interview a few weeks back with the eyewitness from the national park incident? Thoughts? **Post by User2**: Yes! I saw that interview. While I appreciate Marr's attempt to engage deeply with the topics, sometimes his interjections seem to disrupt the flow rather than aid it. The guest seemed like she had more to share, especially about her feelings and the aftermath of witnessing such a traumatic event. **Post by User3**: I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed this. I think Marr's intentions are good, and his enthusiasm for getting to the heart of the matter is clear. However, there are moments where it feels like the guests are just getting to the crux of their point, and then—boom—interruption. It can be a bit jarring as a viewer. **Post by User4**: True, Marr's style has always been quite assertive, which is part of what makes his interviews interesting. But, it does feel like the balance is a bit off lately. That rabbit incident interview was particularly noticeable because the guest was visibly shaken, and it seemed like Marr could've given her a bit more space to tell her story at her own pace. **Post by User5**: I wonder if it's a conscious decision by the showrunners to make the interviews more dynamic or if Marr is just naturally becoming more assertive over time. Either way, I think some guests—especially those sharing sensitive experiences—would benefit from being allowed to express themselves more fully before being interrupted. **Post by User6**: It's a tricky situation. On one hand, Marr probably faces pressure to keep the show moving and cover as much ground as possible. On the other hand, the quality of the interview can suffer if guests don't feel heard. Maybe they could address this with better pre-interview prep, ensuring both Marr and his guests know what to expect and can communicate most effectively. **Post by User7**: That's a solid point, User6. Preparation could certainly help in striking a better balance. Also, it might be useful if the show occasionally acknowledged this feedback—showing that they're listening to viewer observations and willing to adapt. After all, the strength of a program like this lies in its ability to facilitate meaningful conversations. **Post by Moderator**: Great discussion, everyone! It's clear we all value the quality of conversations on the Andrew Marr Show. Let's keep this thread respectful and constructive.

Critics say the shift in Marr's interviewing style, characterized by frequent interruptions and seemingly dismissive remarks, marks a departure from the respectful discourse for which he was once known. \\"It started small on an interview about a tragedy,\\" recounts media analyst Samantha Greene, referring to a segment several weeks ago where Marr's interruptions were particularly noted during a sensitive discussion about a national park incident involving the cruel treatment of an animal. \\"Since then, it's as though the floodgates have opened, and the respect we expected has dwindled,\\" Greene adds. The pivot in Marr's approach has sparked a wider debate about the nature of political and social discourse on television. Some viewers are expressing disappointment, feeling that the quality of conversation and depth of understanding suffer when guests are not allowed to fully articulate their points. In a recent example, during an interview about the contentious Rwanda Scheme with human rights advocate Patricia Evans, Marr's interjections were so frequent that Evans struggled to complete her arguments. At one point, Marr even cut off Evans mid-sentence, exclaiming \\"Abb b b b, just a minute,\\" a moment that has since gone viral, symbolizing for some the nadir of his interviewing approach. Social media platforms have been abuzz with reactions. \\"#MarrInterrupts\\" became a trending topic on Twitter, with viewers sharing clips and their own observations of what many agree is problematic behavior. \\"Interviews should enlighten, not belittle. Respectful interchange is key,\\" tweeted one user, reflecting a sentiment echoed by numerous viewers. Another pointed out, \\"Marr's style now detracts from the substance. It's more about him than the issues at hand.\\" The BBC has yet to formally address the growing concern regarding Marr's conduct. However, an insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggests that the team has taken note of the feedback. \\"There are ongoing discussions about audience response and the show's direction. Finding the right balance in interviews is always a challenge, and viewer input is invaluable,\\" the source shared. As the conversation continues, many are calling for a return to a more civil and engaging discourse. The current climate of debate, often marred by interruptions and one-upmanship, not only undermines the quality of information shared but also the public's trust in media as a platform for understanding complex issues. With viewership loyalty hanging in the balance, the coming weeks could be crucial for Marr and his producers to reassess and perhaps recalibrate their approach to interviews. After all, in an era of soundbites and sensationalism, the need for thoughtful and uninterrupted discussion has never been more acute.

This announcement comes after weeks of escalating criticism concerning Marr's interviewing style, culminating in a recent episode where he hardly allowed his guest to speak, sparking outrage among viewers and critics alike. The decision marks the end of an era for the celebrated journalist, who has become a Sunday staple in homes across the UK. However, with increasing calls for a change in the show's direction, the BBC has opted to bring in Raworth, known for her composed and insightful approach to news delivery and interviews. In a statement released earlier today, the BBC thanked Marr for his years of service and dedication to the show, highlighting his contributions to political journalism. \\"Andrew has been a formidable presenter and journalist during his time on the show. We are grateful for his hard work and commitment to rigorous journalism,\\" the statement read. The controversy reached a boiling point last week during an interview with a climate change activist, where Marr's frequent interruptions prevented the guest from elaborating on critical points about environmental policy. The episode led to a deluge of complaints and negative press, which insiders say forced the network's hand. Sophie Raworth, who has been with the BBC for over two decades, is widely respected for her professionalism and ability to engage with complex subjects thoughtfully. Speaking about her new role, Raworth expressed excitement and vowed to uphold the show's tradition of in-depth political and social discourse. \\"I'm honored to take on this role and look forward to continuing the show's legacy of engaging and insightful discussions with key figures,\\" Raworth commented. The BBC's move has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some loyal viewers of Marr express disappointment over his departure, highlighting his years of hard-hitting journalism and impactful interviews.

This move comes after a series of interviews where Marr's approach seemed to veer off from his usual journalistic rigor, marked by what many perceived as increasingly frequent and, frankly, impolite interruptions of his guests. The pivotal moment, it seems, was a particularly contentious interview last week where Marr hardly let his guest get a word in edgewise, culminating in a wave of viewer complaints and a social media backlash. Here are a few points to consider: - **Marr's Behavior**: Was it a recent development, or has this been an ongoing issue that's only now reached a tipping point? How much did public perception affect the BBC's decision, and was it solely based on his last weeks on the show, or has this been brewing for a while? - **Sophie Raworth's Debut**: Sophie's first appearance as the new host has been met with generally positive reviews, providing a calmer and perhaps more evenly paced interviewing style. Does her approach signal a new direction for the show, and can it satisfy viewers who yearned for a change? - **The Name Change**: \\"The Sunday Profile\\" suggests an in-depth exploration of the topics and personalities making headlines. Is this rebranding merely cosmetic, or does it reflect a deeper editorial shift in how the show will address current events? To me, changing the guard feels not just overdue because of Marr's recent behavior but also indicative of a broader need within media circles to adapt and respond to audience expectations regarding respectful discourse and meaningful engagement with topics of the day. What's your take on this shake-up? Overdue overhaul or a rushed overreaction to a few weeks of contentious interviews? Looking forward to your insights and discussion. Warmly, [Your Username]"},{"prompt":"Write the last week interview, he even says \\"Can you just wait a minute\\"","completion":"***Transcript of Andrew Marr's Last Interview on \\"The Sunday Profile\\"*** **Andrew Marr**: Welcome back. With us now is Dr. Emily Carson, an expert on climate change, here to discuss the recent surge in extreme weather events and what it means for our future. Dr. Carson, there's been a lot of talk about urgent actions needed to address climate change. In your view, what are the most critical steps that need to be taken right now? **Dr. Emily Carson**: Thank you for having me, Andrew. Indeed, the situation is dire, and immediate action is crucial. Firstly, we must drastically reduce our carbon emissions. This means transitioning to renewable energy sources at a much faster pace than we're currently seeing. Additionally, there's a pressing need to... **Andrew Marr**: [Interrupting] Can you just wait a minute, Dr. Carson. For our viewers who may not be as familiar with the terminology, when you say 'carbon emissions,' you're referring to what exactly? **Dr. Emily Carson**: Oh, of course. Carbon emissions mainly come from burning fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, which powers our cars, homes, and industries. These emissions are a significant driver of global warming and... **Andrew Marr**: [Interrupting again] Right, right. But many argue that transitioning too quickly could have massive economic implications, potentially leading to job losses in certain sectors. How do you propose we balance these concerns? **Dr. Emily Carson**: It's a valid concern, Andrew. However, the shift to renewables also opens up new job opportunities, in solar and wind energy, for example. The key is investing in education and retraining programs to... **Andrew Marr**: [Speaking over Dr. Carson] And what about nuclear energy? Some say it's a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Your thoughts on that before we go further? **Dr. Emily Carson**: Nuclear energy does present a low-carbon option, but it comes with its own set of challenges, such as waste disposal and the high costs of building safe nuclear plants. Anyway, as I was saying earlier about the urgent steps... **Andrew Marr**: [Cutting in] Yes, yes, but back to my earlier question. Can we really afford to make these changes at the pace you're suggesting, given the current global economic climate? **Dr. Emily Carson**: Absolutely, we can't afford not to. The economic cost of not addressing climate change far outweighs the investments needed to prevent it. In fact, many studies show that... **Andrew Marr**: [Interrupting] Can you just wait a minute. We're running out of time, and I want to make sure we touch on public responsibility. Quickly, what can individuals do in their daily lives to contribute to the fight against climate change? **Dr. Emily Carson**: Well, individuals can make a difference by reducing energy use, choosing sustainable products, and advocating for environmental policies. But it's important to remember that systemic change led by governments and corporations is... **Andrew Marr**: [Interjecting] Dr. Carson, thank you. That's all we have time for.

I want to have it next to the existing magnito magnet to get an rpm reading","completion":"For creating a tachometer on a two-stroke engine using an existing magneto magnet, you'll want a Hall Effect sensor that is reliable, sensitive, and ideally, one that can handle the environment and conditions of being mounted close to an engine. While there are numerous Hall Effect sensors available in the market, a few key specifications and models can be considered specifically suitable for such applications. # Things to Consider: 1. **Temperature Range:** Ensure the sensor can operate within the temperature extremes of your engine environment. 2. **Sensitivity:** The sensor should be sensitive enough to reliably detect the magnetic field from the magneto magnet. 3. **Output Type:** Look for digital output sensors for easier integration with microcontrollers or tachometer circuits if you plan to do real-time RPM calculation. 4. **Supply Voltage:** Choose a sensor compatible with your system's power supply or the power you can easily derive near the sensor location. 5. **Package Type:** Depending on your mounting options, you might prefer a surface-mount package (SMD) or through-hole (if you're mounting it on a PCB or fabricating a custom enclosure). # Recommended Hall Effect Sensors: - **Allegro Microsystems Sensors (A3141, A3142, A3143, A3144):** These are easy-to-use, digital Hall Effect sensors that are quite popular for RPM sensing in automotive and industrial applications. They come in a through-hole package which might be convenient for prototyping or DIY solutions. - **Honeywell SS41:** A versatile, bipolar Hall Effect sensor with a wide operating temperature range, suitable for harsh environments. It's also relatively inexpensive and commonly available. - **Melexis US5881:** It’s a low-power, unipolar Hall Effect switch. It's especially suitable for battery-operated applications, owing to its low power consumption. The unipolar aspect means it only reacts to a magnet of a specific polarity, which could be beneficial or limiting based on your setup. # Implementation Tips: - **Mounting:** For a two-stroke engine and utilizing the magneto magnet, you’ll need to mount the sensor securely and in close proximity to the magnet's path but without physical contact. - **Debouncing:** The output might need debouncing, either through hardware with a capacitor and resistor or through software in your microcontroller, to ensure clean and consistent RPM readings. - **Testing:** Before finalizing the installation, test the sensor with your setup across the engine's RPM range to ensure accurate and consistent readings. # Final Thoughts: Experimentation might be needed to find the perfect spot and orientation for the sensor. Since the specific environmental conditions, the strength of your magneto's magnet, and your actual setup could impact the sensor's performance, be prepared to tweak your installation for optimal results. Remember to consider the entire system when designing your tachometer, including how you will process and display the RPM data, ensuring a successful integration of the Hall Effect sensor into your two-stroke engine project."},{"prompt":"I have an 80cc two stroke. The kill switch is wired to close the circuit between the magnito and cdi. What relay can handle that same power and me open by a rapsberry pi gpio pins?","completion":"For integrating a relay with a Raspberry Pi GPIO to control the circuit between the magneto and the CDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) system on an 80cc two-stroke engine, you need a relay that can safely handle the voltage and current levels produced by the magneto, and also be triggered (activated) by the low voltage (typically 3.3V) GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. # Key Considerations: 1. **Voltage and Current Rating:** Ensure the relay can handle the peak voltage and current generated by your 80cc two-stroke engine's magneto. Although the magneto's output can vary, it's crucial to know the maximum voltage and current it can produce. Magneto outputs can be quite high (tens of volts), but the current might not be very high. It's often safe to choose a relay capable of handling at least 30-40V and several amps, but check your specific engine specs for more accurate requirements. 2. **Coil Voltage:** The relay's coil needs to be compatible with the Raspberry Pi GPIO output (3.3V). Many relays require higher voltages to operate their coils, so you might need a relay module that's designed to be directly controlled by a Raspberry Pi or a transistor circuit to switch a higher-voltage relay. 3. **Contact Type:** Normally Open (NO) contacts are usually what you'd use for this application, as you'd only complete the circuit (to mimic the action of the kill switch) when you want to stop the engine. # Recommended Solution: **Using a 3.3V Relay Module:** The simplest solution is to use a relay module that is designed to work with 3.3V logic levels, which makes it Raspberry Pi-friendly. These modules often come with built-in transistor circuits that allow the low-power GPIO pins to control a higher-power circuit safely. They also typically include optical isolation for protecting the Raspberry Pi from any high-voltage spikes. **Example Modules:** - **3.3V Relay Boards designed for Raspberry Pi:** These are available from numerous electronics suppliers and designed specifically to be Raspberry Pi-compatible. They can handle the GPIO voltage directly and are generally rated for voltages and currents well within what you'd expect from a magneto. **Wiring and Software:** - **Wiring:** The relay module will have three main connections: Vcc (to Raspberry Pi 3.3V supply), GND (to Raspberry Pi ground), and IN (to a GPIO pin set as an output). The magneto and CDI circuit would connect across the relay's normally open (NO) contacts. - **Software:** In your Raspberry Pi code (perhaps a Python script), you'd control the GPIO pin connected to the relay's input to open or close the magneto-CDI circuit, effectively using the Raspberry Pi to kill the engine. # Safety Note: When interfacing with an engine's ignition system, safety is paramount. Isolate the Raspberry Pi and its components from any high voltage spikes that could occur, and ensure all connections are secure and insulated. Test your setup thoroughly in a controlled environment before regular use. Using a relay with built-in optocouplers (for electrical isolation) is highly recommended to protect your Raspberry Pi and yourself. # Final Thoughts: This setup offers a programmable way to control your engine's operation via the Raspberry Pi. However, remember that working with engine electronics requires caution, especially around high-voltage components like the magneto. Always prioritize safety and double-check your connections and components for compatibility and reliability."},{"prompt":"How much voltage and amperage can be generated by a magneto?","completion":"The voltage and amperage generated by a magneto can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the magneto's design, the speed at which it's being driven, and the specific application it's used for. Magnetos are commonly used in small engines (like motorcycles, lawnmowers, and two-stroke engines), airplanes, and in applications where battery-independent ignition is required. # Voltage: A magneto can generate a wide range of voltages, typically anywhere from several hundred to several thousand volts. For ignition purposes in engines, voltages are often in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 volts or more. This high voltage is necessary to produce a spark across the spark plug's gap, which ignites the fuel-air mixture in the engine's combustion chamber. The actual voltage produced can vary with the engine's speed (RPM), as a faster rotating magneto generates a higher voltage. The voltage output also depends on the construction of the magneto, such as the number of windings in the coil and the strength of the magnets. # Amperage: While magnetos can generate high voltage, the current (amperage) they produce is relatively low, typically in the milliamp range. This is sufficient for ignition purposes because the spark does not require high current to ignite the fuel-air mixture, just a high enough voltage to overcome the resistance of the spark plug gap and create a spark. # Influencing Factors: 1. **Engine Speed (RPM):** As mentioned, higher speeds result in higher voltage outputs. This is because the rate at which the magneto's magnet moves past the coil affects the rate of change of the magnetic field, directly influencing the induced voltage. 2. **Construction and Design:** The materials and build of the magneto (e.g., the strength of the magnets and the number of windings in the coil) play a crucial role in determining its electrical output characteristics. 3. **Load:** The electrical load attached to the magneto (e.g., the ignition system it's powering) can also affect its output, as higher loads can sometimes lower the output voltage. # Practical Implications: When designing or troubleshooting systems involving magnetos, it's important to understand these characteristics. For instance, if a magneto fails to produce enough voltage to spark, it could be due to a problem with the magneto itself (like deteriorated magnets or broken coil windings), or it could be a result of operational conditions (like running at too low an RPM). Because of the variability in magneto designs and applications, it's always recommended to refer to the specific magneto's documentation or manufacturer's specifications for the most accurate information on its electrical output capabilities."},{"prompt":"What kind of relay would be good for a magneto on an 80cc two stroke?","completion":"For controlling or interrupting the circuit from a magneto on an 80cc two-stroke engine, especially if you're using it in conjunction with a kill switch and potentially controlling it via a microcontroller like a Raspberry Pi, you want a relay that can handle the peculiarities of a magneto's output. Since magnetos can produce high voltage spikes, especially during startup or shutdown, you need a relay that is robust enough to handle these without failing. # Key Specifications: - **Voltage Tolerance:** The relay must tolerate high-voltage spikes. Even though the operating voltage might be within the 12V to 48V range under normal conditions, spikes can be significantly higher. A relay with a contact voltage rating of at least 400V would provide a good margin. - **Current Rating:** The current from a magneto is relatively low, so a relay with a contact current rating of a few amps (2A-10A) should suffice for most applications. - **Coil Voltage:** If you're controlling this relay directly with a Raspberry Pi or similar device, you'll need a relay coil that operates at 3.3V or 5V, depending on your control logic. Since most high-voltage tolerant relays require higher coil voltages, you'd likely use a relay module that incorporates a driver circuit to interface with your microcontroller. - **Type:** Opt for a relay with Normally Open (NO) contacts for this application, as it will only complete the circuit when you energize the coil, mimicking the action of a kill switch that grounds the magneto to stop the engine. # Recommended Relay Types: - **Electromechanical Relay:** These are the most common and straightforward relays suitable for switching high voltages and are available in configurations that can tolerate the electrical characteristics of a magneto. Ensure it has a high enough voltage rating and is available in a module form with a driver circuit if you plan to control it with a Raspberry Pi. - **Solid State Relay (SSR):** For applications requiring frequent switching or more preciseness without the mechanical wear and tear, a solid-state relay could be beneficial. SSRs offer faster switching times and have no moving parts, which can increase reliability. However, ensure the SSR can handle the voltage and current requirements of the magneto circuit and check if it needs a heat sink for thermal management. # Example: - A **5V relay module** specifically designed for microcontroller projects can be an excellent choice for interfacing with a Raspberry Pi. These modules often come with built-in transistor drivers and optical isolation for safer operation. You'll control the module's low-voltage side with the Raspberry Pi, and the high-voltage side will switch the magneto circuit. Just make sure the relay itself (on the module) is rated for the high voltages your magneto might produce. # Additional Considerations: - **Optical Isolation:** For protecting your control circuitry, consider a relay module with optical isolation. This feature provides an additional layer of protection against voltage spikes and electrical noise. - **Diode for EMF Protection:** Ensure there's a diode across the relay coil (often built into modules) to protect your controlling electronics from back EMF generated when the coil is de-energized. - **Mounting and Connections:** Ensure that connections are robust and that the relay module is mounted securely, away from high-temperature areas, given the engine environment. # Safety Note: Always exercise caution when interfacing electronics with an engine's ignition system. High voltages and the presence of fuel make for a potentially hazardous combination. Ensure all components are appropriately rated for their roles, and consider consulting with an electrical engineer if you're unsure about any aspects of your design."},{"prompt":"Is it ok if a relay opens and closes many times a second?","completion":"Yes, a relay can open and close many times a second, but whether this is \\"okay\\" depends on several factors, such as the type of relay, the load it's switching, the relay's rated life expectancy, and the specific application. # Types of Relays and Their Suitability: 1. **Electromechanical Relays:** These have physical contacts that open and close. While they can switch many times per second, there are limits. The physical motion of the contacts can wear them out over time, and very rapid cycling can lead to significant wear and reduced lifespan. Additionally, the contacts can \\"bounce\\" for a few milliseconds as they close, which might not be suitable for high-speed switching applications. The switching speed is also limited by the mechanical movement, typically restricting operation to a few hundred hertz at most. 2. **Solid State Relays (SSRs):** These have no moving parts and use semiconductor devices to switch the load. They can switch much faster than electromechanical relays, easily managing hundreds or thousands of times per second (i.e., into the kHz range), and are more durable for high-speed switching applications due to the lack of mechanical wear. However, SSRs can generate more heat than electromechanical relays during operation, especially under high load conditions, which necessitates proper heat management. # Considerations for High-Speed Switching: - **Lifetime:** Even though SSRs can handle rapid switching better than electromechanical relays, all components have a finite lifespan. High-speed switching can affect the overall lifetime of the relay due to thermal stress and material fatigue. - **Application Requirements:** The necessity for high-speed switching should be determined by the application's needs. Some applications might not function correctly if the relay cannot switch quickly enough. In contrast, for others, very rapid switching might not have practical benefits and could unnecessarily complicate circuit design. - **Load Characteristics:** The type of load (resistive, inductive, or capacitive) and its behavior when switched can impact the relay's performance and durability. Inductive loads, for example, can generate voltage spikes that might require additional considerations, such as snubber circuits for protection. - **Duty Cycle:** Continuously switching a relay at a very high speed could lead to increased thermal stress, especially for SSRs. It's essential to consider the duty cycle (the ratio of time on to time off) to ensure the relay can handle the thermal load without overheating. # Best Practices: - **Check the Datasheet:** Always refer to the manufacturer's datasheet for the relay's rated switching speed, life expectancy (typically in number of cycles), and any recommendations regarding switching frequency and load characteristics. - **Consider the Application:** Assess whether high-speed switching is necessary for your application and weigh the benefits against potential downsides, like reduced component lifespan and increased complexity. - **Thermal Management:** For SSRs expected to switch rapidly under significant load, incorporate heat sinks or other cooling methods to manage the generated heat. In summary, while relays can indeed open and close many times a second, choosing the right type of relay and considering its application, load, and expected lifespan is crucial for successful high-speed switching operations."},{"prompt":"موقع للحصول على ايمايلات مستهدفين","completion":"إذا كنت تبحث عن طريقة للحصول على بريد إلكتروني لفئة مستهدفة من الأشخاص لأغراض التسويق البريدي الإلكتروني، فمن المهم الالتزام بالقوانين والأخلاقيات المتعلقة بالخصوصية وحماية البيانات مثل اللائحة العامة لحماية البيانات (GDPR) في الاتحاد الأوروبي، وقانون حماية الخصوصية الإلكترونية (CAN-SPAM) في الولايات المتحدة. الحصول على البريد الإلكتروني بطرق غير شرعية أو استخدامها بدون موافقة المستخدمين يمكن أن يعرضك للمساءلة القانونية. هنا بعض الطرق الشرعية والفعالة لبناء قائمة البريد الإلكتروني: 1. **النماذج على موقعك الإلكتروني:** استخدم نماذج الاشتراك في البريد الإلكتروني على موقعك لجمع العناوين من زوار موقعك. يمكن أن تشمل هذه نماذج اشتراك في نشرة إخبارية، تنزيلات مجانية، وعروض ترويجية. 2. **الحملات الإعلانية:** يمكنك استخدام الإعلانات المستهدفة على منصات مثل فیسبوك ولينكدإن للترويج لعرض تحويلي مثل تحميل دليل مجاني أو الاشتراك في ويبينار بمجرد تقديم عنوان البريد الإلكتروني. 3. **المحتوى المقفول:** قدم محتوى قيمًا كالدراسات البحثية، دورات إلكترونية أو مقالات مفصلة تتطلب من المستخدمين تقديم عنوان بريدهم الإلكتروني للوصول إليه. 4. **الشراكات مع الآخرين:** يمكنك تبادل المحتوى أو الترويج المشترك مع الشركات أو المؤثرين في نفس المجال للوصول إلى جمهور جديد وجمع البريد الإلكتروني. 5. **ورش عمل وفعاليات:** المشاركة في ورش العمل، الندوات الإلكترونية والفعاليات يمكن أن تكون وسيلة فعالة لجمع البريد الإلكتروني من المهتمين بمجالك. من المهم ذكر أن الشفافية والصراحة مع جمهورك حول كيفية استخدام بريد إلكترونيهم وإعطائهم خيار إلغاء الاشتراك في أي وقت، هي المفتاح لبناء الثقة والحفاظ على علاقة إيجابية مع جمهورك."},{"prompt":"ما هو الرائج الآن","completion":"بما أن \\"الرائج\\" يمكن أن يعني أشياء متنوعة في مجالات مختلفة ويتغير باستمرار، سأقدم لك نظرة عامة على بعض الاتجاهات الرائجة في عدة مجالات حتى العام 2023. ومع ذلك، يجب أن تأخذ في الاعتبار أن الرائج قد يختلف بناء على المنطقة الجغرافية والجمهور المستهدف: 1. **التكنولوجيا:** -

Henry's days were filled with exploration and adventure, uncovering the myriad secrets the forest offered. One misty morning, as the sun's rays gently pierced through the dense canopy, Henry set off on what seemed like another routine day of discovery. As he meandered through the underbrush, his keen nose caught the scent of something unusual. It wasn't the familiar earthy aroma of the wet soil after rain, nor the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers. It was something entirely different—something that beckoned him with an unspoken invitation to explore further. Following this mysterious scent, Henry arrived at a clearing he had never visited before. The center of the clearing featured a vast pool of grey, gooey, bubbling mud, exuding a peculiar warmth. The hedgehog had heard tales of mud pits like this one from his elders, said to possess healing properties for those brave enough to bathe in their depths. However, what caught Henry's attention was not the mud itself, but rather what lay within it. Sticking out from the center of the pool were two legs, completely enveloped by the thick, grey substance. The legs made gentle movements, as if their owner was unaware of the predicament they were in. Henry's heart raced with both concern and curiosity. Who could it be? And how did they end up there? Without a second thought, the intrepid hedgehog approached the pool, careful not to get too close to its edge. \\"Hello?\\" he called out hesitantly. \\"Do you need help?\\" Initially, there was no response. Then, suddenly, the legs began to stir more vigorously, as if their owner had just been roused from a deep slumber. A muffled voice emerged from the mud, expressing both surprise and relief at being discovered. \\"Oh, thank goodness! Yes, I could use a bit of help,\\" said the voice, sounding strained yet hopeful. Henry looked around, thinking of ways to assist without endangering himself. Near the edge of the clearing, he spotted a long, sturdy branch. With great effort, he dragged it over to the mud pool and held it out towards the trapped creature. \\"Grab onto this!\\" Henry instructed. After a few attempts, the sticky, mud-covered legs managed to secure a hold on the branch. With all his might, Henry pulled, his tiny feet digging into the soft earth for better leverage. Slowly but surely, the figure began to emerge from the clutches of the mud. To Henry's astonishment, the creature that emerged was not one he recognized. It was a fairy, her delicate wings drenched and her once vibrant dress now a dull shade of grey from the mud. She coughed and spluttered, trying to rid her mouth of the gooey substance, then looked at Henry with a mix of gratitude and bewilderment. \\"How on earth did you end up here?\\" Henry asked, once the fairy had regained her composure. With a wry smile, the fairy recounted her tale of curiosity leading her to explore the mud pit, misjudging its depth and viscosity. She had been stuck there for what felt like an eternity, slowly losing hope of rescue. As the sun climbed higher, casting a golden glow over the clearing, Henry and the fairy worked together to clean her wings and restore her to her former grace. Through this unlikely rescue, a strong bond formed between the hedgehog and the fairy—a friendship that would continue to flourish with each new day and adventure. In the heart of the forest, where magic and reality intertwine, Henry's courageous spirit and the fairy's gratitude weaved a tale of friendship that would be recounted for generations. And the mysterious mud pit?

WebView性能优化 如果WebView渲染动态内容（例如ECharts图表动画）时出现卡顿，尝试以下方法进行优化： - **减少图表的复杂度**：尝试减少图表的数据量或者简化图表的配置。例如，减少数据点的数量、简化图形细节等。 - **关闭ECharts动画**：在ECharts的配置项中关闭动画效果可以减少WebView的渲染压力。可以在图表配置中设置\`animation: false\`来禁用动画。 \`\`\`javascript var option = { animation: false, // 其他配置... }; \`\`\` - **优化WebView设置**：调整WebView的一些参数可能有助于提升性能，尽管默认设置已经为一般使用场景提供了比较好的平衡。 # 3. 加载本地HTML内容 当你使用\`webView.getEngine().loadContent(html);\`加载HTML内容时，确保HTML内容的路径正确，且JavaScript和CSS等资源文件引用的路径也应当更新为相对路径或者正确的本地路径。 # 4. 利用触发渲染 如果图表在初次加载时未正常渲染或者动画被卡住，可以尝试在图表数据加载完成或者页面渲染完成后通过JavaFX触发ECharts的重新渲染。例如，你可以通过布局变化、窗口事件等触发图表的\`resize\`方法: \`\`\`java webView.getEngine().getLoadWorker().stateProperty().addListener( (observable, oldValue, newValue) -> { if (newValue == Worker.State.SUCCEEDED) { // 页面加载成功后执行的操作，例如触发ECharts的resize。 webView.getEngine().executeScript(\\"myChart.resize();\\"); } } ); \`\`\` 确保替换\`myChart.resize();\`中的\`myChart\`为你实际的ECharts实例变量名。 # 总结 加载性能问题以及WebView渲染动画卡顿可能因多种因素引起。以上策略可以在不同层面上进行尝试优化。如果仍然遇到困难，可以进一步检查你的图表配置或JavaFX相关设置，并考虑查找更多关于提升JavaFX WebView性能的高级技巧。"},{"prompt":"还是不行，只会出现一个空的echarts图表，在浏览器里是正常的，但是webview里面只有一个空表，数据没有渲染，表格框架是渲染了的","completion":"如果在JavaFX的WebView中只渲染了ECharts图表的框架而没有显示数据，即使在标准浏览器中一切正常，这通常指向了几种可能的问题。下面列举几个解决该问题的方法和步骤： # 1. 确保ECharts初始化完成 在WebView中，尤其是当包含大量数据或脚本的页面时，可能会在DOM完全加载之前尝试执行JavaScript代码。确保通过适当的方式等页面完全加载后再初始化ECharts实例。 \`\`\`javascript document.addEventListener(\\"DOMContentLoaded\\", function() { // 初始化ECharts实例 }); \`\`\` 或者，在页面加载完成后进行ECharts初始化： \`\`\`java webView.getEngine().getLoadWorker().stateProperty().addListener(new ChangeListener<State>() { @Override public void changed(ObservableValue<? extends State> observable, State oldValue, State newValue) { if (newValue == Worker.State.SUCCEEDED) { // 页面加载成功，执行JavaScript初始化ECharts图表 webView.getEngine().executeScript(\\"yourInitChartFunction();\\"); } } }); \`\`\` 确保替换\`yourInitChartFunction();\`为实际调用初始化ECharts图表的JavaScript函数名。 # 2. 检查JavaScript错误 可能是WebView中JavaScript的一个错误阻止了ECharts的数据渲染。查看是否有JavaScript错误十分关键。 尽管JavaFX WebView不提供一个内置的开发者工具，你可以通过监听控制台消息来输出错误或警告到Java控制台。 \`\`\`java webView.getEngine().getLoadWorker().exceptionProperty().addListener(new ChangeListener<Throwable>() { public void changed(ObservableValue<? extends Throwable> o, Throwable old, final Throwable value) { if (webView.getEngine().getLoadWorker().getState() == FAILED) { System.out.println(\\"JavaScript error: \\" + value.getMessage()); } } }); \`\`\` # 3. JavaScript和CSS资源加载验证 确认所有参与渲染的JavaScript和CSS文件都已成功加载。对于本地文件的加载，确保文件路径是正确的。如果是使用\`webView.getEngine().loadContent(html);\`方法直接加载HTML内容，确保内联JavaScript没有问题，并且所有外部资源的路径也能正确解析。 # 4. 数据传递与格式 检查传递给ECharts的数据格式是否正确。有时候，数据格式问题或数据未按预期方式传递到ECharts初始化脚本中，可能会导致图表显示为空。 # 5. 测试简化版本 尝试使用极简的ECharts配置和静态数据看是否能够显示。这有助于排除是否是ECharts配置过程中的错误。 \`\`\`javascript var myChart = echarts.init(document.getElementById('main')); var option = { // 简化的配置项 }; myChart.setOption(option); \`\`\` 如果简化后的图表可以显示，那么问题很可能出现在原始的图表配置或数据集中。 遵循这些步骤应该能帮助你进一步诊断问题所在。如果问题仍然存在，可能需要具体查看ECharts初始化代码、图表配置、数据传递等环节，以找出问题的根源。"},{"prompt":"还是不行，javafx是不是和echarts不兼容","completion":"JavaFX 的 \`WebView\` 本质上是一个简化版的浏览器，使用 WebKit HTML/CSS/JavaScript 引擎来渲染内容。尽管它支持很多现代网页技术特性，它的兼容性和性能可能不及完整的桌面浏览器，如 Chrome、Firefox 或 Safari。因此，在某些情况下，复杂的 JavaScript 库或应用程序（比如 ECharts）可能无法在 JavaFX \`WebView\` 中以预期的方式运行。这可能是由于多种原因造成的，包括但不限于： 1. **JavaScript 兼容性**：JavaFX \`WebView\` 的 WebKit 版本可能不支持 ECharts 需要的某些较新的 JavaScript 特性。 2. **性能限制**：ECharts 在渲染大量数据或复杂图表时可能需要相对较高的计算能力，而 \`WebView\` 可能没有足够的性能来流畅运行这些操作。 3. **资源加载问题**：从远程或本地加载资源（如 JavaScript 或 CSS 文件）时可能遇到的路径问题、跨域请求问题或加载延迟。 # 解决方案尝试： - **确保兼容性**：尽管直接解决 \`WebView\` 和 ECharts 之间的兼容性问题可能比较困难，但可以尝试使用 ECharts 提供的不同版本来检查是否有较好的兼容性。 - **减少图表复杂度**：尽量使用简单的图表和较少的数据点，以减少 \`WebView\` 需要渲染的内容。 - **使用本地资源**：将 ECharts 和相关库的本地副本包含在你的应用程序中，而不是从 CDN 加载，以避免加载相关的问题。 - **调试信息**：获取 \`WebView\` 中 JavaScript 执行的错误或警告信息可能很有用。如前所述，你可以监听控制台消息并将其输出到 Java 控制台来帮助调试。 - **考虑替代方案**：如果 ECharts 仍然无法在 \`WebView\` 中按预期工作，或许可以考虑其他图表库或将图表渲染工作放在服务器端进行，然后将渲染结果以图片或 SVG 格式直接显示在 \`WebView\` 中。 # 最后的选择 如果所有方法都尝试过后仍无法解决问题，那么可能需要考虑调整项目方案。例如，可以考虑： - 使用其他图表库看看是否有更好的兼容性。 - 使用完整的浏览器组件（如使用 JCEF [Java Chromium Embedded Framework]，但这将大大增加应用程序的复杂度和体积）。 - 考虑是否有必要在当前的 JavaFX 应用中集成图表，或者是否可以通过外部浏览器来展示这部分数据。 JavaFX 作为一个客户端技术，其在与现代 JavaScript 库集成方面确实存在一定的局限性。在项目初期就考虑好技术栈的兼容性和限制，将有助于后续开发的顺利进行。"},{"prompt":"那你给我一个旧版本的echarts

Most dreaming happens during a stage of sleep known as Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, although dreams can occur in other sleep stages as well. REM sleep typically makes up about 20-25% of an adult’s sleep cycle, and during this stage, the brain is very active, which is believed to contribute to vivid dreams. Dreams can range from mundane to bizarre and may be influenced by a variety of factors including events from our waking lives, our thoughts, worries, and desires. The purpose and content of dreams are still subjects of study and debate among scientists and psychologists. Some theories suggest that dreaming serves purposes such as processing emotions, incorporating memories, and problem-solving. While everyone dreams, not everyone remembers their dreams. The ability to recall dreams can vary widely from person to person and even from one night to another. Factors influencing dream recall include sleep quality, stress levels, and whether or not one is abruptly awakened during REM sleep. Additionally, some medications and substances can affect dreaming and dream recall."},{"prompt":"What does bimbo mean","completion":"The term \\"bimbo\\" originally emerged in the early 20th century, around the 1920s, and it has evolved in usage and connotations over the years. Initially, it was used to describe an unintelligent or brutish man. The word itself is derived from the Italian word \\"bambino,\\" which means \\"little child\\" or \\"baby,\\" indicating a lack of maturity or sophistication. However, over time, the meaning and application of the term shifted. By the mid-20th century, \\"bimbo\\" began to be used predominantly to refer to an attractive but unintelligent woman. This usage carries a derogatory connotation, suggesting that the individual's worth is superficially tied to physical appearance rather than intellect or personality. The term implies a dismissal of the woman's abilities beyond her looks and often is used in sexist or demeaning contexts. It's important to note that language evolves, and the connotations and interpretations of words can shift over time. The use of \\"bimbo\\" in contemporary discourse is often seen as offensive, reflecting outdated stereotypes about women. In some circles, there have been attempts to reclaim or reframe the term, but it remains largely problematic due to its historical usage and underlying sexist implications."},{"prompt":"Has Randy Gardner laid down during the sleep deprivation","completion":"Randy Gardner, who famously set the record for the longest documented time without sleep in 1964, stayed awake for 264.4 hours (approximately 11 days and 24 minutes) without using stimulants of any kind. During his experiment, Gardner engaged in various activities to keep himself awake, but reports suggest that he remained standing or sitting and did not lie down to rest during the experiment. He was under observation by Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement and his own high school student observer, Bruce McAllister, as well as others who ensured the validity of the effort and monitored his health. Lying down might have made it much harder for Gardner to stay awake, as this posture is associated with relaxation and the onset of sleep. The physical activity and engagement with people and tasks likely helped him maintain wakefulness for the duration of the experiment. Despite not sleeping, Gardner did experience significant cognitive and psychological effects from the sleep deprivation, including mood swings, problems with concentration and short-term memory, paranoia, and hallucinations. Remarkably, he reportedly recovered from this experiment without long-term physical or psychological effects, although extensive sleep deprivation like this is strongly advised against due to the severe health risks it poses."},{"prompt":"What is a bimbo","completion":"The term \\"bimbo\\" traditionally has a derogatory connotation and has evolved in its usage over time. Originally, in the early 20th century, \\"bimbo\\" referred to an unintelligent or brutish man. This derived from the Italian word \\"bambino,\\" which means \\"baby\\" or \\"child,\\" suggesting a lack of sophistication or depth. However, its meaning shifted over the decades, and by the mid-20th century, it began to be predominantly used to refer to an attractive but unintelligent woman. The term suggests that the person's value is superficially tied to their appearance rather than their intellect or other qualities, perpetuating a sexist stereotype that diminishes women's capabilities and worth to their physical attractiveness alone. In more recent years, there have been movements to reclaim or reinterpret some derogatory terms, including \\"bimbo.\\" Some individuals and online communities have attempted to subvert the negative connotations of \\"bimbo,\\" embracing aspects of the aesthetic or identity in an empowering manner, promoting a message of self-expression, confidence, and challenging traditional norms of intelligence and beauty. Despite these efforts, the use of the term can still be contentious and is often context-dependent, with its interpretation varying significantly among different groups and individuals."},{"prompt":"Did Randy Gardner laid down","completion":"During his famous sleep deprivation experiment in 1964, Randy Gardner did indeed remain standing or sitting for the most part to avoid falling asleep. The primary goal was to test the effects of sleep deprivation on the human body, specifically avoiding sleep, not just lying in bed awake. There are no detailed records indicating that he spent prolonged periods lying down; the emphasis in reports about the experiment is on his avoidance of sleep altogether, which would include staying out of bed or any environment conducive to sleeping. Gardner managed to stay awake for 264.4 hours, or approximately 11 days, which is an extreme and potentially dangerous length of time to go without sleep. He was closely monitored by researchers, including sleep researcher Dr. William C. Dement, to ensure his safety. Throughout the duration, Gardner engaged in various activities to stay awake, and it is generally understood that lying down would have increased the likelihood of accidentally falling asleep, counteracting the experiment's objectives. While specific instances of whether Gardner laid down briefly for rest without sleeping might not be well-documented, the overarching narrative is that he successfully avoided sleep and the behaviors most likely to induce it, such as lying down in a comfortable, sleep-ready environment."},{"prompt":"hi, please recommend the best performers similar to antent","completion":"If you're interested in artists similar to Antent, it's likely you enjoy electronic music with a blend of melodic dubstep, future bass, and perhaps some elements of EDM that push the boundaries through experimental sounds.

It's used for automating Chrome or Chromium browsers to perform tasks on web pages. # Understanding of Web Fundamentals - **HTML/CSS**: Knowing how web pages are structured is crucial for effective scraping, as this will help you identify the data you want to extract. - **JavaScript**: Understanding how client-side scripting works is important for scraping dynamic websites that load content asynchronously. - **HTTP/HTTPS Requests**: Understanding the basics of web requests, including the differences between GET and POST requests, status codes, headers, etc. # Tools and Utilities - **Postman**: Useful for testing APIs and understanding how web requests work. - **Browser Developer Tools**: Learning how to use the Inspect Element tool and the Network tab in browsers like Chrome or Firefox is essential for identifying web page elements and debugging. # Data Handling - **JSON/XML**: Many websites and APIs send data in JSON or XML format. Understanding these data formats is crucial. - **Databases**: Knowledge of databases (SQL or NoSQL) is important for storing the data you've scraped. - **Data Cleaning/Transformation Tools**: Familiarity with libraries like Pandas (Python) for cleaning and transforming your data. # Legal and Ethical Considerations - Understand the legality of web scraping and respect the \`robots.txt\` file of websites, which specifies the scraping rules. - Be aware of the terms and conditions of the websites you scrape, as some explicitly prohibit scraping. # Monetizing Your Skills - **Freelancing**: Platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr have numerous web scraping projects. - **Data as a Service (DaaS)**: Offer your web scraping skills as a service to businesses needing up-to-date data. - **Create Your Own Products**: Use your scraping skills to gather unique datasets and sell them, or create applications that rely on scraped data. Improving your skills in these areas and understanding how to apply them ethically will enable you to take on web scraping projects confidently and potentially get paid for your expertise. Always remember to scrape responsibly and respect the legal boundaries surrounding the use of scraped data."},{"prompt":"How to parse a website if it uses dynamic data loading in Python","completion":"Parsing websites that dynamically load data typically involves interacting with JavaScript-based elements that are not available when you simply fetch the HTML content of the page using traditional HTTP requests. This is because the content you're after is often loaded asynchronously using JavaScript after the initial page load. To handle such cases, you'll need tools that can execute JavaScript and wait for the page's dynamic content to load. One popular approach involves using Selenium, a tool originally developed for automating web browsers for testing purposes, but also widely used for web scraping dynamic content. Another newer approach, especially for sites that load data from APIs, involves directly accessing these APIs if possible, which can be more efficient than automating a browser. # Using Selenium Selenium allows you to programmatically control a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, enabling you to mimic user behaviors such as clicking buttons, scrolling, and waiting for AJAX data to load. Here's a basic example of how you might use Selenium with Python to scrape dynamic content: 1. **Install Selenium**: First, make sure you have Selenium installed. If not, you can install it via pip: \`\`\`bash pip install selenium \`\`\` 2. **Download a Web Driver**: Download the appropriate web driver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, geckodriver for Firefox). Ensure it’s placed in your PATH or specify its location directly in your code. 3. **Basic Selenium Script**: Here's a simple script to open a page and print its title: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver # Specify the path to your driver (adjust as necessary) driver_path = \\"/path/to/your/driver/chromedriver\\" browser = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path) # Open a webpage browser.get(\\"https://example.com\\") # Wait for the dynamic content (Example: wait 10 seconds) browser.implicitly_wait(10) # Now you can parse the page source with BeautifulSoup or just Selenium from bs4 import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.page_source, 'html.parser') # Example: print page title print(browser.title) # Example: find element(s) by CSS selector dynamic_elements = soup.find_all(class_=\\"dynamic-class\\") for element in dynamic_elements: print(element.text) # Don't forget to close the browser browser.quit() \`\`\` # Direct API Requests If the website loads its dynamic content via an API, you might bypass the need for Selenium by requesting the data directly from the API. This approach is generally faster and less resource-intensive. 1. **Inspect Network Traffic**: Open the website in a browser, and use the browser's developer tools to inspect the network traffic. Look for XHR/fetch requests that load the data you're interested in. 2. **Recreate the API Request**: Using Python's \`requests\` library, replicate the API request to fetch the data directly. \`\`\`python import requests # Example API endpoint (find the real one from the network tab) api_url = \\"https://example.com/data/api\\" # Example: GET Request (adjust based on the actual request observed) response = requests.get(api_url) # Assuming the response data is JSON data = response.json() # Now, you can work with \`data\` directly print(data) \`\`\` # Things to Remember - **Ethical Considerations**: Always check the website's \`robots.txt\` and Terms of Service to ensure compliance with their rules on automated access. - **Rate Limiting**: Be respectful by not bombarding the website with too many requests in a short period. - **Legal Aspects**: Understand the legal implications of scraping a website, especially concerning data privacy and copyright laws. Combining these techniques allows you to efficiently parse dynamic websites. Start with direct API requests when possible, and resort to browser automation with Selenium for more complex scenarios."},{"prompt":"What should I do if I don’t receive the python data I need when I get a get request in web scraping?","completion":"If you're attempting to scrape data from a website using a GET request in Python (typically using the \`requests\` library) and you're not receiving the data you need, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially solve the issue: # 1. **Check the Response Status Code** First, check the response status code to ensure your request was successful. A \`200\` status code indicates success, while other codes (like \`404\` for Not Found, \`403\` for Forbidden) indicate problems that need to be addressed. \`\`\`python response = requests.get(url) print(response.status_code) # Should be 200 for a successful request \`\`\` # 2. **Inspect the Response Content** Inspect the content of the response to see if it contains the expected data or if you might need to adjust your request. \`\`\`python print(response.content) \`\`\` # 3. **Review the Website’s robots.txt File** Check the \`robots.txt\` file of the website (e.g., \`http://example.com/robots.txt\`) to ensure that scraping is allowed and you’re not requesting a disallowed URL. # 4. **Check for Dynamic Content** If the data is loaded dynamically with JavaScript, \`requests\` won’t be able to fetch it since it does not execute JavaScript. You can: - Inspect the Network tab in your browser's Developer Tools to identify any API requests the page makes to fetch the data. If such an API request is found, you can try to replicate this request directly with \`requests\`. - Use a tool like Selenium that can automate a browser, allowing the JavaScript to run and the content to load. # 5. **Inspect Network Traffic** Using your browser's Developer Tools, inspect the Network traffic to ensure your GET request is correctly formatted. Sometimes, websites require specific headers, cookies, or query parameters to respond with the correct data. # 6. **Update Request Headers** Websites might check the \`User-Agent\` or other headers to block scrapers or bots. Try mimicking a browser by setting a \`User-Agent\` and other necessary headers in your request: \`\`\`python headers = { 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3' } response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) \`\`\` # 7. **Consider Cookies or Session Data** Some websites require you to have specific cookies or session data to access certain content. You can use the \`Session\` object in \`requests\` to maintain a session: \`\`\`python with requests.Session() as s: # Your code to login or set cookies response = s.get(url) \`\`\` # 8. **Respect the Site’s Policies** Make sure your scraping activities align with the site's terms of service and legal requirements. Heavy scraping can lead to your IP being banned. # 9. **Handle Redirects** Automatically handle or inspect redirects. The \`requests\` library does this by default, but you can customize this behavior if needed. \`\`\`python response = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True) \`\`\` # 10. **Debugging and Logs** Use Python's logging facilities or print statements to debug and track the flow and data in your request: \`\`\`python import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) \`\`\` By implementing these strategies, you can often overcome issues where you're not receiving the expected data from a GET request in a web scraping task. Always remember to scrape responsibly and ethically."},{"prompt":"Recommend the best books and courses for doing web scraping in Python","completion":"Whether you're a beginner or looking to advance your web scraping skills, there's a wealth of resources available.

Este término puede aplicarse en diversos contextos, como por ejemplo en el ámbito legal, laboral, familiar, político, internacional, entre otros. En esencia, una declaración de conflicto puede surgir cuando hay intereses, valores, acciones o direcciones opuestas que no pueden coexistir armoniosamente sin algún tipo de negociación o mediación. La declaración es un paso importante porque marca el reconocimiento oficial de que hay un problema que necesita ser abordado, lo cual es el primer paso hacia la búsqueda de una solución. La manera específica en la que se realiza una declaración de conflicto y los procedimientos a seguir después de ello pueden variar significativamente dependiendo de las normas, reglamentos o leyes aplicables en el entorno específico en el cual surge el conflicto. Por ejemplo: 1. **En el ámbito laboral**: La declaración de conflicto puede ser el preludio a negociaciones formales entre trabajadores (posiblemente representados por un sindicato) y la gerencia, o incluso a huelgas. 2. **En las relaciones internacionales**: La declaración de un conflicto podría llevar a negociaciones diplomáticas, intervención de organismos internacionales, o en casos extremos, conflictos armados. 3. **En el contexto legal**: Podría implicar la presentación de una demanda o queja formal ante un tribunal o entidad de resolución de disputas. La declaración de conflicto es, por tanto, un reconocimiento oficial que busca abrir las vías para la resolución del mismo, ya sea a través del diálogo, mediación, negociación o procedimientos legales. Es un componente esencial del proceso para manejar y eventualmente resolver disputas de manera estructurada."},{"prompt":"puede catalaña tras declarar unilateralmente la independencia hacer una declaracion de conflicto si españa no la reconoce?","completion":"Si Cataluña declarara unilateralmente la independencia y España no la reconociera, la situación se encaminaría hacia un escenario de conflicto político y legal significativo. En términos de \\"declarar un conflicto\\" en sentido formal, dependería de cómo se interprete esa acción en el contexto específico de las relaciones entre Cataluña y España, así como del derecho internacional. La noción de \\"declarar un conflicto\\" no tiene necesariamente un procedimiento estándar en el contexto de la independencia de una región dentro de un país, pero hay varias consideraciones importantes en este hipotético escenario: 1. **Reacciones políticas y legales en España**: En el marco jurídico español, una declaración unilateral de independencia por parte de Cataluña es considerada ilegal bajo la Constitución de 1978, que declara la indivisibilidad de la nación española. Por ende, España, sostendría que Cataluña está actuando fuera de la legalidad, llevando a un conflicto legal y político. 2. **Declaración de conflicto en el sentido político**: Cataluña, tras declarar unilateralmente la independencia y ante el rechazo de España, podría emitir declaraciones políticas denunciando lo que percibe como un conflicto sobre su derecho a la autodeterminación frente a la postura de integridad territorial del Estado español. Esto podría considerarse una \\"declaración de conflicto\\" en términos políticos y diplomáticos. 3. **Intervención internacional**: La situación podría llegar a requerir mediación o intervención de organismos internacionales si es considerada como un conflicto de interés para la comunidad internacional. Sin embargo, es común que otros países y organizaciones internacionales sean reacios a intervenir en asuntos que consideran internos de un Estado soberano, a menos que se produzcan violaciones graves a los derechos humanos o se amenace la paz internacional. 4. **Consecuencias y resolución**: La resolución de este conflicto dependería enormemente de la diplomacia, la negociación y la mediación entre las partes, así como de la reacción de la comunidad internacional. La historia reciente (particularmente el intento de 2017) muestra que estos eventos llevan a profundizar los desacuerdos y tensiones, resultando en consecuencias legales para los líderes del movimiento independentista, además del aumento en la polarización política y social. Es importante mencionar que este tipo de situaciones son extremadamente complejas y no tienen soluciones fáciles, y la manera en que se proceda tendría profundas implicancias para todas las partes involucradas. La búsqueda de una solución negociada que respete los derechos y opiniones de todas las partes sería fundamental para resolver el conflicto de manera satisfactoria."},{"prompt":"por lo que lo mas seguro es que viendo lo que paso en el 2017, se vuelva a producir el mismo resultado, que la comunidad internacional apoye a España en la defensa de su constitución y luego haya consecuencias legales para los responsables, no?","completion":"Basándonos en los eventos ocurridos en 2017, cuando Cataluña realizó un referéndum de independencia considerado ilegal por el gobierno español y el Tribunal Constitucional de España, es plausible prever un patrón similar si se diera nuevamente una declaración unilateral de independencia por parte de Cataluña. El precedente establecido en 2017 sugiere varios resultados probables: 1. **Apoyo internacional a España**: La mayoría de la comunidad internacional se mostró reacia a reconocer la declaración unilateral de independencia de Cataluña en 2017, apoyando la soberanía y la legalidad constitucional de España. Esto se debió en gran medida a dos razones: la defensa generalizada del principio de integridad territorial de los estados y la renuencia a respaldar un precedente de secesión unilateral que podría incentivar movimientos secesionistas en otras partes del mundo. Es probable que una situación similar en el futuro genere el mismo tipo de respuesta por parte de otros países y organizaciones internacionales. 2. **Consecuencias legales para los líderes independentistas**: En el caso de 2017, varios líderes del movimiento independentista catalán enfrentaron cargos legales, incluyendo sedición, rebelión y malversación de fondos públicos. Si se produjera una nueva declaración unilateral de independencia, es previsible que el gobierno español actúe de manera similar, tomando medidas legales contra aquellos que considera responsables de violar la constitución. 3. **Polarización política y social**: La situación en 2017 llevó a una polarización significativa tanto en Cataluña como en el resto de España, afectando el tejido social y político. Un nuevo intento de independencia unilateral podría exacerbar estas divisiones, perjudicando el diálogo y complicando aún más las posibilidades de encontrar una solución consensuada al conflicto. 4. **Posibilidad de diálogo**: Sin embargo, cada crisis también abre la posibilidad de buscar nuevos caminos hacia el diálogo y la negociación. La gestión de la situación posterior a cualquier intento futuro de secesión dependerá de las circunstancias específicas del momento, incluidas las actitudes de los gobiernos catalán y español, así como de la comunidad internacional. En resumen, basándonos en lo ocurrido en 2017, es razonable esperar que una declaración unilateral de independencia por parte de Cataluña llevaría a un apoyo internacional a España, consecuencias legales para los líderes independentistas, y una profundización de la polarización. Sin embargo, cada situación tendría sus propias dinámicas y podría ofrecer tanto riesgos como oportunidades para todas las partes involucradas."},{"prompt":"que quiere decir conocimiento steam?","completion":"El término \\"STEAM\\" se refiere a un enfoque educativo que integra cinco áreas de estudio: Ciencia (Science), Tecnología (Technology), Ingeniería (Engineering), Artes (Arts) y Matemáticas (Mathematics).

However, the significant detail about Gardner's experiment was that he did not fall asleep or engage in sustained periods of sleep during the entire duration. The experiment was closely observed by Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement, among others, to ensure Gardner stayed awake throughout those 11 days. Closing one's eyes momentarily or blinking does not equate to sleeping or even napping. Moreover, during the sleep deprivation period, Gardner might have engaged in activities or been in environments where closing his eyes briefly (for seconds or momentarily) was natural, such as when washing his face or being in a brightly lit area to minimize discomfort. But there's a distinction between these brief closures and actually attempting to sleep or dozing off, which Gardner successfully avoided throughout the experiment."},{"prompt":"System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.NotImplementedException: The method or operation is not implemented. at TestModule.TestItem.Buy(ILKPlayer player, TestConfig config) in C:Userszoro8RiderProjectsLKTestModuleTestModule.cs:line 29 at LKCoreApi.LKItemPrefab\`1.Buy(ILKPlayer player, ItemConfig config) in C:Userszoro8RiderProjectsLKLKCoreApiLKItemPrefab.cs:line 7 at LK.LKPlugin.OnBuyItem(LkPlayer player, LKItem registeredItem) in C:Userszoro8RiderProjectsLKLKLKPlugin.cs:line 80 at LK.LKPlugin.<>c__DisplayClass20_0.<OnSelectProductItem>b__0(CCSPlayerController _, ChatMenuOption _) in C:Userszoro8RiderProjectsLKLKLKPlugin.cs:line 74 at CounterStrikeSharp.API.Modules.Menu.BaseMenuInstance.OnKeyPress(CCSPlayerController player, Int32 key) in E:githubCounterStrikeSharpmanagedCounterStrikeSharp.APIModulesMenuBaseMenu.cs:line 132 at CounterStrikeSharp.API.Modules.Menu.MenuManager.OnKeyPress(CCSPlayerController player, Int32 key) in E:githubCounterStrikeSharpmanagedCounterStrikeSharp.APIModulesMenuMenuManager.cs:line 72 at CounterStrikeSharp.API.Core.Application.<>c.<Start>b__16_0(CCSPlayerController player, CommandInfo info) in E:githubCounterStrikeSharpmanagedCounterStrikeSharp.APICoreApplication.cs:line 101 at CounterStrikeSharp.API.Core.Commands.CommandManager.HandleCommandInternal(Int32 playerSlot, IntPtr commandInfo) in E:githubCounterStrikeSharpmanagedCounterStrikeSharp.APICoreCommandsCommandManager.cs:line 159 at InvokeStub_Action\`2.Invoke(Object, Span\`1) at System.Reflection.MethodBaseInvoker.InvokeWithFewArgs(Object obj, BindingFlags invokeAttr, Binder binder, Object[] parameters, CultureInfo culture) --- End of inner exception stack trace --- at System.Reflection.MethodBaseInvoker.InvokeWithFewArgs(Object obj, BindingFlags invokeAttr, Binder binder, Object[] parameters, CultureInfo culture) at System.Delegate.DynamicInvokeImpl(Object[] args) at CounterStrikeSharp.API.Core.FunctionReference.<CreateWrappedCallback>b__18_0(fxScriptContext* context) in E:githubCounterStrikeSharpmanagedCounterStrikeSharp.APICoreFunctionReference.cs:line 100 В чем ошибка? public class TestItem : LKItemPrefab<TestConfig> { public override bool Buy(ILKPlayer player, TestConfig config) { Server.PrintToChatAll(config.Duration.ToString()); return true; } public override string Name => \\"123\\"; } public abstract class LKItemPrefab<T> : ILKItemPrefab where T : ItemConfig { public bool Buy(ILKPlayer player, ItemConfig config) => Buy(player, (T)config); public abstract bool Buy(ILKPlayer player, T config); public abstract string Name { get; } } public interface ILKItemPrefab { bool Buy(ILKPlayer player, ItemConfig config); string Name { get; } }","completion":"The exception you're encountering, \`System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException\`, is a wrapper exception that indicates an error occurred within a method that was invoked through reflection, which in your case appears to be the \`Buy\` method. The crucial part of the stack trace is: \`\`\` ---> System.NotImplementedException: The method or operation is not implemented. at TestModule.TestItem.Buy(ILKPlayer player, TestConfig config) in C:Userszoro8RiderProjectsLKTestModuleTestModule.cs:line 29 \`\`\` This inner exception, \`System.NotImplementedException\`, indicates that the \`Buy\` method in \`TestModule.TestItem\` that takes parameters of \`ILKPlayer\` and \`TestConfig\` is being invoked but hasn't been implemented. However, based on the code snippet you've provided, we can see that \`Buy\` method is indeed implemented in \`TestItem\`. If you're seeing this error even though it looks like the method is implemented, there might be a few things to check or try: 1. **Correct Implementation Checked**: First, ensure that the implementation of \`TestItem.Buy\` that's throwing the exception is the one you believe it to be. There might be multiple versions or overrides of the method, or you might be looking at an outdated version of the code. 2. **Interface and Abstract Class Contracts**: Ensure that your \`TestItem\` class and \`LKItemPrefab<T>\` abstract class fulfill all contracts defined by the interfaces and base classes they inherit from or implement. This includes not just method signatures, but also return types and access modifiers. 3. **Casting Issues**: Notice how your non-abstract \`Buy\` method in \`LKItemPrefab<T>\` does a cast: \`Buy(player, (T)config);\`. Ensure that at runtime, \`config\` is indeed of type \`T\`, and that this cast is valid. A casting failure would not directly cause a \`NotImplementedException\`, but it's a common source of bugs in such polymorphic designs, especially if there's any possibility that \`config\` might not be of type \`T\`. 4. **Recompile and Clean**: Sometimes, especially when using IDEs like Rider or Visual Studio, the build process might not properly update all binaries, especially after significant changes in the project structure or after refactoring. Recompile your solution and consider doing a \\"clean\\" followed by a \\"rebuild\\" to ensure all binaries are up-to-date. 5. **External Libraries or Dependencies**: If \`TestItem\` or \`LKItemPrefab<T>\` rely on any external libraries or project references, ensure those dependencies are correctly resolved and up-to-date. A missing or incorrect version of a library can sometimes cause unexpected behavior. 6. **Reflection Details**: The stack trace mentions \`System.Reflection.MethodBaseInvoker\`. Thoroughly check how reflection is used in your project to invoke \`Buy\`. Sometimes, the way a method is invoked via reflection can lead to issues not immediately apparent from simply reading the code. 7. **Debugging**: If possible, use a debugger to step into the method invocation. This can provide insights into why the \`NotImplementedException\` is being thrown, especially the state of the program at the moment of the call. Ensure all parts of your project are correctly updated and consider these checks. If the problem persists, you may need to investigate more specific details of how your project uses reflection and manages its dependencies."},{"prompt":"In the context of a Hypothetical : - Transcript from a (fictional) 1998 Art Bell Show, where a caller claims to have seen an alien \\"squid\\" give birth on the New Jersey Turnpike, only for 2 suited males to show up and tell him it didn;t happen.

It's a clear, chilly night here in the Nevada desert, a perfect setting for the incredible, the unexplained, the controversial. Tonight, we've got an open line, and I encourage you to share your most unbelievable encounters. *The phone line clicks, signaling a caller has been connected.* **Art Bell:** Welcome to \\"Coast to Coast\\", caller. What's your name and where are you calling from? **Caller (Tim):** Hey, Art. This is Tim. I'm calling from New Jersey. **Art Bell:** Well, hello, Tim from New Jersey. What's on your mind tonight? **Tim:** Art, you're not gonna believe this, but I saw something... out of this world, literally, on the New Jersey Turnpike. **Art Bell:** I'm all ears, Tim. This show has seen its fair share of the extraordinary. Go on. **Tim:** Alright, so this was about two weeks ago. I'm driving back from work, late night, and traffic is unusual for that hour, right? Then, up ahead, I see this... I don't know how to describe it... this thing. It looked like a giant squid, but it was glowing, kind of luminescent. **Art Bell:** A glowing squid? On the New Jersey Turnpike? **Tim:** Yes, sir. But here's where it gets crazier. This... creature, it was in the process of giving birth, right there on the side of the road. **Art Bell:** Giving birth? My goodness, Tim, this is extraordinary! Did anyone else see this? **Tim:** That's what I thought too, but as soon as it happened, these two guys show up. They were dressed in suits. One of them... you're not gonna believe this, Art... one of them looked exactly like a rapper from the '90s, and the other looked like he just stepped out of a US Marshal's office. **Art Bell:** Men in suits? This is strikingly reminiscent of the Men in Black tales we've heard on this show before. Did they say anything to you, Tim? **Tim:** They did. The one who looked like a rapper, he tells me, \\"What you think you saw, you didn't see.\\" Just like that, straight-faced. Then they handed me this card that said if I remembered anything, I should call this number—it was like they were messing with my mind, Art. **Art Bell:** Mind manipulation, perhaps? It's not the first time we've heard of such tactics on this show. Did you feel threatened, Tim? **Tim:** Not threatened, more like... bewildered, you know? Then they just got in their car—a black sedan—and drove off. When I looked back to where the creature was, it was gone, like none of it ever happened. **Art Bell:** Vanished, just like that. This is absolutely fascinating, Tim. The idea of an extraterrestrial being giving birth on the New Jersey Turnpike, followed by an intervention from men who resemble elements of pop culture... it's all very cinematic, yet here you are telling us this firsthand. What do you make of it all, Tim? **Tim:** Art, I've been a skeptic my whole life, but this... I don't know what to believe anymore. It feels like there's a whole other world out there, hidden in plain sight. **Art Bell:** Indeed, Tim, it does seem that way. Perhaps, folks, we are not alone, and the truth, as they say, is stranger than fiction. Tim, thank you for sharing your remarkable story with us tonight. Stay safe out there, and keep your eyes open. **Tim:** Will do, Art. Thanks for listening. *Phone line disconnects.* **Art Bell:** To all our listeners out there, Tim's story is a testament to the mysteries that surround us, the unexplained phenomena that occur on this planet we call home.

I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, your guide through the uncharted territories of the unknown. Tonight, we've been exploring the theme of cryptids - creatures of legend and lore that hide just beyond the veil of our understanding. And it seems our global phone lines are buzzing with tales tonight. We're now connected to a caller from across the pond, as they say. Your name and where you're calling from? **Caller (Charles):** Hello, Art. My name is Charles, and I'm calling from London, England. Long-time listener, first-time caller. **Art Bell:** Ah, London! A city replete with history and mystery. What story do you bring to our listeners tonight, Charles? **Charles:** Thank you, Art. Well, it's a bit of an odd tale, involving something rather unexpected in the heart of our city. You see, I had an old army buddy, served together in the '60s, and he shared with me a most peculiar story about the London Underground...and the Yeti. **Art Bell:** The Yeti, Charles? As in, the abominable snowman often reported in the Himalayas? Found in the London Underground? **Charles:** Precisely, Art. It sounds mad, doesn't it? But according to my friend, back in the mid-'60s, there were reports, hushed whispers among the Underground staff, about creatures lurking in the unused service tunnels. Described much like the Yeti of Himalayan lore, but, of course, far from their snowbound home. **Art Bell:** Incredibly fascinating! The Underground has always struck me as a place of deep secrets. Continue, please. **Charles:** Well, Art, these reports described the creatures as being incredibly tall, covered in thick fur, and possessing an unnerving intelligence in their eyes. There were tales of them causing disruptions, sightings by maintenance crews, even whispers of a government cover-up to prevent a public panic. **Art Bell:** It doesn't get much more intriguing than that, Charles. Yeti in the London Underground. It's almost as though it's straight out of a science fiction serial. **Charles:** Indeed, Art. My friend was convinced there was truth to the tales. He spoke of a time when he himself heard roars echoing through the tunnels late at night while on leave and walking near an entrance to the Underground. **Art Bell:** Roars in the night... A chilling thought. It raises so many questions about what lies hidden in the places we consider familiar. Did your friend or any others ever find evidence, something solid to prove these creatures' existence? **Charles:** That's where the story grows cold, I'm afraid. My friend sought answers, but those who had claimed to see the Yeti were reticent to speak openly, for fear of ridicule or worse. It was as though there was an unspoken agreement to keep the mystery just that—a mystery. **Art Bell:** Ah, the all-too-familiar silence that seems to shroud these extraordinary claims. It's a pattern we see often with the unexplained. Charles, your tale tonight adds a rich layer to the tapestry of cryptid stories shared on this program. Thank you for bringing it to us. **Charles:** My pleasure, Art. I only wish I had more to offer your listeners, some tangible proof. But perhaps some stories are best left to stir the imagination. **Art Bell:** Perhaps they are, Charles. Or perhaps, they challenge us to look deeper, question more, and keep our minds open to the endless possibilities of our world. Safe travels through those ancient streets of London, Charles. And to our listeners, what do you think? Is the London Underground home to creatures beyond our comprehension, or is this another urban legend, a tale for the telling in the wee hours? *As Art Bell muses on the subject, the line disconnects, leaving the audience to their wonder and speculation, the theme music swells, signaling another break in tonight's journey through the unknown.* --- *This fictional transcript is inspired by the blending of call-in radio storytelling with elements reminiscent of the legendary \\"Coast to Coast AM\\" program, reflecting an engaging dialogue on cryptids and urban legends, stirred with a nod to classic science fiction influences like \\"Doctor Who.\\"*"},{"prompt":"Art Bell caller - Followup to \\"Charles\\" - Another British caller asks if Art's heard to story of a politergiest in a tube station...

Right after our conversation with Charles about the Yeti supposedly lurking in the London Underground, we have another call from across the Atlantic. This time, we're heading back to the same vein of mystery but with a twist. Caller, you're on the air with Art Bell. **Caller (Simon):** Hello, Art. This is Simon, also calling from London. I caught the tail end of Charles' call and couldn’t resist adding to tonight's theme. It’s about a poltergeist, believe it or not, also connected to the Underground. **Art Bell:** A poltergeist in the Tube? Now, this is a first on the program. Tell us more, Simon. **Simon:** Yes, Art. It’s a story that’s been whispered among some circles here. It’s inspired by an old tale—a television serial, I believe, called *Quatermass and the Pit*. The story goes that during an expansion of the Tube system, workers unearthed something...ancient and otherworldly, not far from the truth written in that serial. This led to reports of unexplainable events at one of the stations. **Art Bell:** Otherworldly? That's right up our alley here. What kind of events are we talking about? **Simon:** Well, Art, it started with tools going missing, only to be found in impossible locations. Then, it escalated to sightings of spectral figures and unexplained chilling draughts sweeping through closed areas. But the most terrifying aspect was the sudden violent outbursts among the workers—uncharacteristic and totally irrational behavior, as if they were being influenced by an unseen force. **Art Bell:** That sounds like textbook poltergeist activity, but with a twist of something more, perhaps something from the beyond. Did they find anything in this excavation that might explain these phenomena? **Simon:** The story goes that they did—an ancient artifact believed to be of extraterrestrial origin. But, much like any good mystery, the artifact was quickly removed by government officials, and the events were hushed up. The station was completed, but the disturbances... they didn’t fully stop. There are still reports, even to this day, from late-night commuters who sense an unsettling presence or witness unexplained phenomena. **Art Bell:** Simon, this is compelling. A blend of poltergeist activity, ancient artifacts, and government cover-up—elements that tick every box for a deep dive investigation. It’s a story that tempts one to dig deeper, to question the history beneath our feet. Have you personally experienced anything unusual in the Tube, Simon? **Simon:** Not personally, Art. But I’ve always felt an eerie sense of being watched while passing through some stations late at night. Considering London’s long and tumultuous history, who can say what lies beneath? **Art Bell:** Indeed, Simon. London, a city built upon layers of its own past, each with its own stories wanting to be heard. Thank you for adding another layer to tonight’s conversation. An ancient, perhaps alien, artifact stirring spirits in the London Underground—listeners, what do you make of this? The floor is yours. *The line goes quiet as Simon disconnects, leaving Art Bell to ponder the mysteries shared, whilst the faint eerie theme music creeps back to set the stage for more tales from the edges of reality.* --- *Echoing the atmospheric and speculative essence of \\"Coast to Coast AM,\\" this fictional transcript offers a homage to the enigmatic tales that captivate and challenge our understanding of the world, inspired by the rich history of British speculative fiction like \\"Quatermass and the Pit.\\"*"},{"prompt":"A caller from Canada, with a Donut eating bigfoot, They called it 'TIm' even though it didn't speak... ;)","completion":"# Transcript from the \\"Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell\\" - February 12, 1999 *Otherworldly music fades, bringing us back to Art Bell's velvety voice, broadcasting deep into the night.* **Art Bell:** Welcome back to \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and we've been wandering through the shadowy realms of the unexplained this evening. Our phone lines are open, and it looks like we've got a caller from the Great White North. Caller, you're live on the air. What's your name, and what's your story? **Caller (Dave):** Hey Art, this is Dave, calling from British Columbia, Canada. First off, love the show. I've got something you might find amusing—or perplexing—depending on how you look at it. **Art Bell:** Thank you, Dave. I'm all ears. What's on your mind tonight? **Dave:** So, it's about a Bigfoot—or, at least, that's what we think it is. A group of us have a bit of a... unique situation with one that's been hanging around our town. And before you ask, no, we don't have any photos. This creature is smarter than your average bear, or Bigfoot, for that matter. **Art Bell:** Intriguing, Dave. A clever Bigfoot certainly piques interest. Do continue. **Dave:** Right, well, it all started a few months back. We started noticing donuts missing. We'd leave them out for the forestry workers as a kind of thank-you, and they'd vanish. At first, we thought it was just the crew getting extra hungry, but then one night, I saw him—massive, easily 8 feet tall, covered in hair, just chowing down on a box of donuts we'd left out. **Art Bell:** A donut-eating Bigfoot, now that's a first for the show. Sounds like he has quite the sweet tooth. **Dave:** Oh, absolutely. But here's where it gets even more bizarre. We decided, if he's going to be our neighbor, we might as well be friendly. So, we started leaving out donuts specifically for him. And, I kid you not, Art, it's like we've reached an understanding. We leave donuts, and in exchange, small trinkets have started appearing. Rocks, feathers, things like that. My daughter calls him Tim, after the donut chain, you know? **Art Bell:** (Chuckles) Tim the Bigfoot, I love it. It's remarkably heartwarming, Dave, this interaction you have with him. The exchange of gifts is particularly fascinating—it implies a level of intelligence and social understanding we rarely associate with creatures like Bigfoot. **Dave:** Exactly, Art. We don't feel threatened by him at all. It's more like he's become a part of the community, in his own way. I just thought it was a story worth sharing. In a world where we hear about so much negativity, here's something a bit different, a bit mysterious, but also kind of... nice. **Art Bell:** Indeed, Dave, it's a refreshing tale. It speaks volumes about coexistence and the mysterious bonds we can form with the natural world—assuming, of course, Bigfoot falls into that category. Thank you for sharing such an incredible story. Tim the Bigfoot, a gentle giant with a penchant for pastry. That’s something to ponder. *The line goes silent as Dave finishes his story, leaving Art and his listeners with a sense of wonder and amusement.* **Art Bell:** To all our listeners out there, what do you think? Is Tim the Bigfoot a sign of the undiscovered living among us, or is there another explanation? And what does this story tell us about the creatures that walk the edges of our reality?

Tell us your name and where you're calling from. **Caller (Jack):** G'day, Art. This is Jack, and I'm calling from a little ways outside of Alice Springs, Australia. First off, huge fan of the show. Never thought I'd have my own story to tell, though, especially something like this. **Art Bell:** Thank you, Jack. We're equally excited to have you with us. Australia's vast landscapes are ripe with mystery. So, what's your story? **Jack:** Right, so this happened about a year ago. I was out in the Outback, a real remote stretch, doing some geological survey work. Long story short, I had a mishap, took a nasty fall, and ended up breaking my leg pretty bad. I was alone, no cell service, and miles from anyone. It was looking pretty grim, Art. **Art Bell:** A terrifying situation to be in, Jack. Being stranded alone like that, injured... I can't even imagine. **Jack:** Yeah, it was the definition of a nightmare. I wasn't sure I was gonna make it. But here's where it gets weird. That night, as I'm lying there, I hear a voice, clear as day. It was my grandfather's voice—mind you, he passed away about ten years ago. He told me, \\"Stay strong, I'm going to get help.\\" **Art Bell:** Your deceased grandfather spoke to you. That's incredible, Jack. What happened next? **Jack:** I must have passed out from the pain because the next thing I know, I'm waking up to the sound of a chopper. It was the Royal Flying Doctor Service. They said they received an emergency call from an old bloke who claimed his grandson was in trouble out in the region I was surveying. Gave them precise coordinates and everything. **Art Bell:** Unbelievable! But there was no way your grandfather could have made that call. **Jack:** Exactly, Art. Nobody else knew exactly where I was. The doctors figured I must have triggered the distress signal myself somehow. But here's the kicker—I didn't have the means to send out a signal, and the description the caller gave matched my granddad to a T, even down to his voice that the operator remembered. **Art Bell:** Jack, that is a spine-tingling tale of survival and, perhaps, proof of something beyond our understanding. A call from the beyond, quite literally, that saved your life. **Jack:** That's how I see it, Art. I always had a bit of belief in the afterlife, but after this, I'm convinced. There's something more out there. My grandfather watched over me that day. **Art Bell:** A moving and powerful story, Jack. It's a poignant reminder that the bonds we share with those we love might indeed transcend the physical world. Thank you for sharing this miraculous experience with us. **Jack:** Thanks for having me, Art. It's a story I'll be telling for the rest of my days, and I'm just glad to share it with someone who believes in the impossible. *The line grows quiet, leaving Art and his global audience to contemplate the mysteries of life, death, and the indelible connections that defy explanation.* **Art Bell:** To everyone listening tonight, Jack's tale is a testament to the incredible, the unexplained, and the power of love transcending the veil between life and death.

We have a caller from Las Vegas with a theory that might just bend your mind more than a bit. Caller, welcome to \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" What's your name, and let's dive into your theory. **Caller (Eddie):** Hey Art, name's Eddie. Love the show; it's like a beacon in the dark for those of us who've seen the unexplainable. So, here's the thing. Everyone's been trying to track down Bob Lazar, ask more questions, or debunk his claims about working on alien tech at Area 51, right? **Art Bell:** Right, Bob Lazar's story has been a hot topic of controversy and fascination for years. Claims of reverse-engineering alien spacecraft, it's the stuff of legend. So, what's your take, Eddie? **Eddie:** Well, my theory, Art, is that Lazar himself—due to his close proximity to the alien tech and the experiments conducted—accidentally fell through a dimensional rift. The \\"Sports Model\\" spacecraft he talked about? I believe during one of the tests, it tore a hole in the fabric of our reality. Lazar, being the lead on the project, was affected in ways we can only begin to imagine. **Art Bell:** A dimensional rift. That's a bold theory, Eddie. So, you're suggesting that the reason Bob Lazar has been so elusive, why there's such a thin trail on him, is because he's not entirely in our dimension anymore? **Eddie:** Exactly, Art. Think about it. There have been times when Lazar seems to just vanish and reappear on the public stage. His educational and employment records practically nonexistent as if they were erased—or maybe they slipped into this other dimension. He's like an echo of himself here, while the real Lazar might be...somewhere else. **Art Bell:** Intriguing notion there, Eddie. An echo of Bob Lazar among us, while the real one is... elsewhere. This would presuppose a level of technology or natural phenomena beyond our current understanding. Have you considered what kind of implications this would have, not just for Lazar, but for physics as we know it? **Eddie:** Oh, absolutely, Art. If we accept the possibility of dimensional rifts, we're talking about a whole new field of physics, one that includes multi-dimensional travel, parallel universes, the works. Lazar \\"falling through\\" could have been an unintended proof of concept. Who knows what kind of information, what kind of technology, exists on the other side of that rift, and what that could mean for humanity? **Art Bell:** Astounding to ponder, Eddie. A concept that sounds straight out of science fiction, yet here we are, discussing its potential reality. Lazar's experiences and the mysteries surrounding him have always opened the door to more questions than answers. Your theory adds yet another layer to that enigmatic story. **Eddie:** I figure, if anyone's open to exploring these possibilities, it's you and your listeners, Art.

The mystery of Bob Lazar continues to intrigue and challenge our understanding of the possible. *The call ends, leaving a silence that's quickly filled by Art Bell's reflective tone and the eerie melody signaling another break in the show.* **Art Bell:** Is Eddie onto something?

Before the break, we were talking about time travel and the vehicles that could, hypothetically, take us through the ages. And while the DeLorean from \\"Back to the Future\\" is, undoubtedly, the most iconic time machine we've come to know, tonight we're wondering: what other classic cars might serve as worthy vessels for traversing time? I have to say, I'm curious if there's anything out there from Detroit—a time machine made in the USA. Let's open the lines. What classic car would you choose for your time-travel adventures? *The line is opened, and several callers suggest various models, keen to share their visions of automotive time machines.* **Caller 1 (Henry):** An old British Mini Cooper, Art. Imagine zipping through time in that small package, weaving history together. Compact, but full of potential! **Caller 2 (Isabel):** I’d go with a Land Rover, one of those sturdy models from the '60s. If I’m traveling through time, I want to do it no matter the terrain! **Caller 3 (Marco):** How about an Italian classic? A Fiat 500—a stylish way to see the ages, blending right into the Renaissance or a Roman coliseum! *After several more suggestions, Art addresses his earlier remark.* **Art Bell:** Fascinating choices, everyone. I have to say, though, I'm a tad disappointed. The Mini Cooper, Land Rovers, even a Fiat, but nothing from Detroit? Surely, the Men in Black, if they're out there shopping for an American-made time machine, might have some suggestions. *Just as Art laments the lack of American cars in the theoretical time-travel fleet, another caller cues up.* **Caller 4 (Tom):** Art, I don’t have a time machine, but I do have a story about a haunted hearse—a Cadillac hearse, mind you, straight out of Detroit! **Art Bell:** A haunted hearse, you say? Not exactly what we were looking for, but I can't resist a good haunt. Let's hear it. **Tom:** This old Cadillac hearse was rumored to roam the backroads at night, appearing out of nowhere, headlights piercing the darkness. Legend has it, it carried the spirits it once transported in life, seeking... something. Maybe a final ride, maybe revenge. **Art Bell:** Intriguing—a spectral escort carrying souls across the threshold. That certainly brings a whole new dimension to \\"American-made.\\" You've redeemed us, Tom. Not time travel, per se, but traversing the boundaries between life and death is quite the journey itself. **Tom:** Exactly, Art. If cars have spirits, this one carried more than most. And it was made right in the heart of Detroit. **Art Bell:** A haunting tale, indeed, and distinctly American. Thank you for sharing, Tom. It just goes to show, whether it’s transporting souls through time or to the afterlife, the vehicles of our imaginations and legends carry endless possibilities. *The show continues, the night filled with discussions that blur the lines between past and present, the physical and ethereal, exploring the fantastical journeys we dream of undertaking.* **Art Bell:** Whether it's a British Mini-Cooper bending time, a Land Rover conquering the uncharted or an American hearse bridging the realms of the living and the dead, the vehicles of our dreams and nightmares take us places far beyond the here and now.

I’m Art Bell, and tonight we delve into the mysteries of the universe and perhaps, the mysteries of our very identities. Our next caller hails from Manchester, England. Welcome to \\"Coast to Coast.\\" Tell us your name, and share your experience with us. **Caller (Jamie):** Uh, hi Art. My name’s Jamie. Love the show; it’s really an honor to be on. So, um, this is a bit difficult to explain, but I believe that I’m not... well, not entirely human. Or rather, my soul isn’t. **Art Bell:** That’s okay, Jamie. Take your time. This is a safe space for all stories, no matter how out of this world they might seem. You believe your soul originates from somewhere else? **Jamie:** Yes, exactly. It's going to sound strange, but I’ve always felt disconnected from this world, like I didn’t really belong here. And recently, I’ve come to understand why. I believe my soul is from the Pleiades. I’ve had this deep, unexplainable connection to the star cluster for as long as I can remember, and well, there's more to it. **Art Bell:** The Pleiades, a star cluster often associated with ancient myths and legends, and indeed, some modern extraterrestrial theories. Jamie, what leads you to believe your soul is from there? **Jamie:** It’s a multitude of things, really. But the turning point was when I tried on a pink catsuit for a costume party. I know it sounds a bit funny, but when I put it on, for the first time in my life, everything just clicked. I felt... at peace, like that was how I was supposed to be. And wearing crystals, too. They just resonate with me on another level, giving me comfort and a sense of belonging. **Art Bell:** I see. Clothing and crystals can indeed be powerful in how they make us feel, in their ability to align us closer to our true selves. It's fascinating that a pink catsuit and crystals helped spark this revelation for you. How has this understanding changed your view of yourself and your place in the world? **Jamie:** It's been transformative, Art. Knowing—or feeling—this connection to the Pleiadians has given me so much clarity. I've always felt out of place, struggling with who I am in a society that, let's face it, isn't always kind to those who are different. Discovering this aspect of my identity has given me a strange sense of peace. It's like I finally understand why I've felt the way I have, and now I have a direction, a purpose of sorts—to connect with others like me and explore this connection further. **Art Bell:** Jamie, your story is a poignant reminder of the profound quest for identity that many of us are on. Whether it’s a connection to the stars, to different cultures, or simply to each other, it’s these explorations that truly define the human—or, in your case, the Pleiadian—experience. Thank you for sharing your journey with us, for reminding us of the vastness of identity and the universal search for belonging. **Jamie:** Thank you, Art, for giving me the platform to share. It means a lot. **Art Bell:** You're welcome, Jamie. Take care, and keep looking up.

This All Hallows' Eve, we’ve ventured through tales of hauntings, UFO sightings over cemeteries, and even whispered conspiracies from the shadowy corners of our world. Now, we're connecting to Los Angeles, where a caller claims to have knowledge of a PBS special so unsettling, it was buried by the powers that be. You're on the air, caller. Please, share with us your tale. **Caller (Alex):** Hi, Art. Long-time listener, first-time caller here. What I’m about to share sounds like something out of a horror novel, but from what I’ve pieced together... it’s very real. In the early '90s, PBS ran a live Halloween special, something akin to the BBC's 'Ghostwatch'. It was supposed to be a fun, immersive ghost hunting experience, using a local \\"haunted\\" house. **Art Bell:** Ah, ‘Ghostwatch’. I remember that caused quite the stir across the pond. So, you're suggesting PBS attempted something similar here in the States? This is the first I'm hearing of it. **Alex:** Exactly, Art. But something went horribly wrong during the live broadcast. Viewers started calling in, reporting bizarre occurrences in their own homes – TVs turning on and off, strange noises, and some even said they felt presences in their rooms with them. The climax of the show supposedly involved a medium attempting to communicate with the spirits in the house. That's when all hell broke loose, both on set and for viewers at home. **Art Bell:** Goodness. Live television summoning spirits. It’s like opening Pandora’s Box in front of an unsuspecting public. What happened next? **Alex:** Well, the broadcast was abruptly cut. For those watching live, it was replaced with a standard emergency test message, then just static until PBS resumed normal programming. There was no acknowledgment from the station, no re-runs, and any attempts to discuss or investigate the special were met with silence or generic responses about 'technical difficulties'. **Art Bell:** A broadcasting mystery veiled in supernatural phenomena – it's the kind of story that sends shivers down your spine. Alex, how did you come across this information? **Alex:** Digging through old forums, talking to people who remember watching it, and a few former PBS staff who were there that night. It’s like everyone involved was sworn to secrecy, but bits and pieces of the truth have a way of slipping out over time. **Art Bell:** Indeed, they do. And it's stories like these, the ones that are buried, whispered about in hushed tones for fear of what they might reveal, that remind us the world is not as it seems. That perhaps there are forces, energies, entities beyond our understanding, waiting just on the other side of our reality. Alex, I want to thank you for bringing this to light, for sharing this tale with us on the perfect night – Halloween. **Alex:** Thanks, Art. Hopefully, talking about it now can uncover more of the truth. Happy Halloween. *As the call ends, the haunting theme of \\"Coast to Coast AM\\" gently ushers listeners back, leaving them to ponder the unseen and the unheard, the covered-up, and the possibly conjured spirits of the night.* **Art Bell:** To those of you listening, wrapped in the safety of your homes, or perhaps venturing into the night, remember: the veil is thin on Halloween. Keep your wits about you, and maybe, just maybe, turn off the TV – you never know what might come through. Stay with us.

On this night of shadow and whisper, we continue our journey into the unknown. I see we have another caller on the line, this time pondering a question that might unravel another layer of the cosmic tapestry. Caller, you're live on \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" **Caller (Caleb):** Hi Art, it's Caleb here, from Flagstaff. I've been thinking, if there can be ghosts of people, ghosts of animals even, why not ghosts of aliens? Like, after a UFO crash or something similar. And what about places like Roswell? Could there be... I don't know, stone tape echoes in the bismuth layers that are rumored to be part of alien technology? **Art Bell:** Caleb, you've just opened a fascinating box of possibilities. The concept of ghosts, spirits lingering after their physical form has departed, is universally tied to humanity's lore and history. But the idea of alien ghosts, now that's something we've touched upon less frequently. **Caleb:** Exactly, Art. I mean, if spirits are energy, and energy can't be destroyed, only transformed—then couldn't there be extraterrestrial entities bound to Earth, or certain materials, due to their untimely demise or the emotional, traumatic energies released during incidents like crashes? **Art Bell:** An intriguing hypothesis. The notion that locations such as Roswell could be haunted not just by the memories of past events but by the specters of beings from another world is captivating. If we consider the \\"stone tape theory\\"—the idea that stones and metals can record events, especially traumatic events, much like a tape records sound—then applying it to materials associated with extraterrestrial encounters could revolutionize our understanding of hauntings. **Caleb:** Right, and considering bismuth's supposed properties—non-linear electrical resistance, potentially altering magnetic fields—if it's indeed used in the construction of UFOs, could layers of bismuth act as a medium to capture... well, alien stone tape echoes? **Art Bell:** Caleb, you're artfully blending science and the paranormal, a conjunction we adore here. If layers of bismuth, or any exotic material for that matter, found in crash sites or associated with UFOs could hold the echoes or even the spirits of non-human entities... that raises the question of what kinds of messages or phenomena they could be replaying. These \\"stone tapes\\" wouldn't just be historical records but could also be windows to understanding extraterrestrial intentions, traumata, and perhaps their perceptions of humanity and Earth. **Caleb:** It's like we've been searching for signs of extraterrestrial life out there, but maybe some of them have been here all along, trapped or imprinted in the very materials we find so mysterious. **Art Bell:** Indeed, Caleb. As we continue to seek out these answers, let's not forget that the universe is vast and complex, and its mysteries are not merely to be found in the vastness of space but also in the echoes of energies transferred between worlds and beings. Thank you for such a stimulating discussion—a perfect topic for this Halloween night. **Caleb:** Thank you, Art. Keep looking up and wondering. *With the close of the call, the iconic theme of \\"Coast to Coast AM\\" fills the air once more, leaving listeners in contemplation of the energies and entities that might share this universe with us, seen and unseen, known and yet to be discovered.* **Art Bell:** As we look to the skies and seek the unknown, let's not forget that the answers we seek might already be here, recorded in the very earth beneath our feet.

Now, we're heading down to the bayous, where music and mystery intertwine. Caller, you're on the air with \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" **Caller (Elias):** Hey, Art. This is Elias, calling in from the mangroves just outside the bustling life of New Orleans. I've got a tale that I think might chill the bones of your listeners on this eerie night. **Art Bell:** New Orleans, a city of culture, mystery, and the unexplained. Elias, please, share your tale with us. **Elias:** So, there's this jazz venue I frequent in New Orleans, known for its vibrant history and even more colorful legends. The place is a magnet for locals and tourists alike, drawn in by the promise of soul-stirring music. But, Art, there’s something... more, lingering in the notes there. **Art Bell:** Intriguing. Music has a way of transcending the physical, doesn't it? What have you experienced? **Elias:** Well, it's as if there's an extra member in the band, one that you can't see but can definitely hear. Especially when the band really gets into the groove of the night, that's when I've heard it—a phantom sax playing alongside the musicians. Clear as day, but when you scan the stage, there's no one there accountable for the sound. **Art Bell:** A phantom saxophonist... The thought alone evokes such a haunting image, a soul so enraptured by the music that not even death can keep them from playing. Have others noticed this spectral musician? **Elias:** Yes, and it's been the talk of the venue on more than one occasion. The musicians themselves, they've come to accept it as part of the place's charm. They say it’s the spirit of a performer who used to light up the stage back in the day, one whose love for the jazz was as profound as it was enduring. **Art Bell:** It seems New Orleans, with its deep cultural roots and storied past, would be the perfect backdrop for such a phenomenon. Music, especially jazz, is more than just sound; it's emotion, memory, and for some, it appears, an everlasting connection to the place they loved. **Elias:** That's a beautiful way to put it, Art. And it's eerie, sure, but it's also pretty moving. When you’re there, swaying to the invisible notes, you feel part of something larger—a shared, timeless experience that defies explanation. **Art Bell:** Elias, thank you for sharing this mesmerizing encounter with us tonight. It’s a potent reminder that sometimes, the things we cannot see are those that touch us the deepest. Keep listening to the music of the night, my friend.

I—I’m going to stay anonymous, if that’s okay. Call me John. Something happened to me that’s been messing with my head. It’s about my friend, a hacker, well known in certain online circles. We used to chat on IRC a lot, talking code, discussing leaks, regular stuff for us. **Art Bell:** Understandable, John. Anonymity is respected here. Please, go on. **John:** Well, he was in a terrible accident, ended up in a coma. It was all over our community; we were launching fund drives, tributes, you name it. Then, one night, I'm on IRC, and he logs on. Same nickname, same typing style.

At first, I thought it was a sick joke, some troll who’d hacked his account. But the details he knew, the things we talked about—there’s no way it could have been anyone else. **Art Bell:** A truly unsettling experience, John. Was there any particular message he was trying to convey to you during these conversations? **John:** It was bizarre because, most of the time, he'd just talk about fixing some code or working on a new project. But sometimes, he’d say things like “I’m stuck” or “it’s dark here.” That spooked me. I didn’t know what to make of it. **Art Bell:** My goodness, phrases like that could indeed imply a consciousness trying to reach out from an altered state. And when he awoke from the coma, did he have any recollection of these interactions? **John:** That’s the thing, Art. He never did wake up. Passed away a few months later. I kept logs of our chats, hoping to find some closure, maybe a logical explanation. Was it a ghost in the machine, early AI testing its boundaries, or as you suggest, a time rift here in the Bay Area? **Art Bell:** An enigmatic tale, John.

You're on the air. Please, share with us your encounter with the supernatural. **Caller (Tom):** Hi Art, this is Tom from Vermont. Never thought I'd have my own story to share, but here we are. So, a few weeks back, I borrowed a lawnmower from my neighbor. Nothing out of the ordinary, just neighbors being neighbors. **Art Bell:** Ah, good neighborly relations—a rare treasure. But I sense this story takes a turn? **Tom:** You could say that, Art. So, I kept putting off returning it. You know how it is, one thing leads to another. But then, things got weird. I started hearing these strange howls at night, unlike any dog or wolf I know. It was more... haunting. And then, I saw it—a huge, black hound with eyes that glowed in the dark, lurking at the edge of my property. **Art Bell:** A phantom hound, a spectral entity linked to many a myth across cultures. Did it do anything besides watch you? **Tom:** Well, that's the thing, Art. It didn't just watch; it chased me. The first night I saw it, I thought I was dreaming, but then it happened again. This time, I was taking the trash out, and there it was, emerging from the shadows. It chased me right back to my front door. I’ve never been so scared in my life. **Art Bell:** Terrifying! An encounter with a creature of the night on your own doorstep. What did you do? **Tom:** Here’s where it gets weirder. I mentioned it to another neighbor, half-joking to lighten the mood. He’s an old-timer, knows a lot about local legends and such. He told me the hound might be a harbinger, a warning of sorts, urging me to correct something I’d neglected. **Art Bell:** Interesting, a harbinger. It’s not uncommon in tales of the supernatural for entities to serve as messengers. And did you take his advice? **Tom:** I did. The next morning, I returned the lawnmower to my neighbor, apologizing for keeping it so long. I kid you not, Art, I haven’t seen or heard that hound since. It’s like it vanished into thin air, just as mysteriously as it appeared. **Art Bell:** That’s a fascinating resolution, Tom. The phantom hound’s pursuit ended with a simple act of returning a borrowed item.

Now, we venture into a realm that touches the everyday yet veers into the inexplicable. Our next caller has a tale of time, or rather the mystery of missing time, within the confines of a subway journey. Welcome to \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" **Caller (Maggie):** Hi, Art. This is Maggie, calling from Boston. Thank you for taking my call. I've got a story that I've been turning over in my mind for years, and I thought tonight's the night to share it. **Art Bell:** We're all ears, Maggie. Missing time is a phenomenon that's both intriguing and unsettling. Please, tell us what happened. **Maggie:** It was back when I was in college. I hopped on the subway to visit a friend, a ride I'd taken countless times. It should've been a quick 15-minute trip, end to end. I remember getting on, the train was fairly empty, and I found a seat easily. I wasn't tired, wasn't on my phone—this was before smartphones were a thing—I was just sitting there, looking forward to seeing my friend. **Art Bell:** Sounds like the start of any ordinary day. **Maggie:** Right, but this time, when I finally got off the train, I felt... off, like I’d zoned out. But more than that, it was dark outside. I thought it was a prank at first, maybe I had fallen asleep, and it was just later in the afternoon. But no, Art, two hours had passed. My friend was worried sick, calling me over and over. And I had no explanation for it. **Art Bell:** A 15-minute ride that turned into a two-hour journey. Maggie, during this time, did anything unusual happen that you can recall? Any peculiar stops or passengers? **Maggie:** That's just it, Art. Nothing. It was as if I blinked and time jumped. I've wracked my brain, thinking maybe I did fall asleep and just didn’t realize it. But nothing adds up. I didn't feel rested as if I’d taken a nap. I felt disoriented and a bit nauseous. And my friend said I sounded strange on the phone, like I wasn't myself. **Art Bell:** It’s a classic case of missing time, often reported in UFO encounters, though less commonly associated with subway rides. Yet, the feeling of disorientation, the gap in your memory, and your friend’s observation suggest you experienced something extraordinary. In your heart, Maggie, what do you believe happened during that missing time? **Maggie:** I’ve gone over it a million times, and the logical part of my brain says there must be a simple explanation. But another part wonders if I somehow slipped through... I don’t know, a tear in reality? Experienced a time anomaly? It’s haunted me, Art. It changed how I see the world, how I perceive reality and time. **Art Bell:** Maggie, yours is a profound experience that echoes the sentiments of many who’ve encountered the unexplainable. These events challenge our understanding of the fabric of reality, suggesting that there might be layers to our existence far beyond what conventional norms dictate. *As Maggie’s account comes to an end, it leaves a palpable sense of wonder and curiosity hanging in the air.* **Art Bell:** This Halloween, as we explore the boundaries of the known, let's ponder the mysteries that Maggie and others have glimpsed—fleeting moments where time and reality itself seem to warp and weave tales of their own.

Welcome to \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" You're on the air. **Caller (Raymond):** Hi, Art. This is Raymond from Virginia. I've got a story that’s a bit of American history mixed with the supernatural. I never really talked about it much until now. I thought tonight’s the night. **Art Bell:** American history and the supernatural are a potent mix, Raymond. Please, go ahead. **Raymond:** It was back in the late '90s. I was in D.C., had an appointment to see a senator about a veterans' affairs issue. I was early, waiting in one of those magnificent halls, just soaking in the history of the place. That's when I saw him—Abraham Lincoln—or at least, someone who looked incredibly like him. Tall, wearing period clothing, just walking down the hall, head down like he was deep in thought. **Art Bell:** Wait, you saw a figure resembling President Lincoln just walking the halls of the Capitol? **Raymond:** Yes, Art, clear as day. But here's the thing, I blinked, and he was gone. Vanished. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me, a figment of my imagination, maybe. But when I met with the senator, I mentioned it, half-joking. His reaction was what got me. He didn’t even flinch. Just nodded and said, \\"It happens sometimes,\\" as if seeing Lincoln’s ghost was part of a normal day in the Capitol. **Art Bell:** Astonishing, Raymond. The idea that the spirit of Lincoln might still wander those halls, perhaps watching over the nation’s workings, is both eerie and somewhat comforting. **Raymond:** That's just it, Art. It felt surreal, but not frightening. If anything, I felt an incredible sense of calm wash over me. It’s hard to describe. I’ve read about Lincoln sightings in the White House, but at the Capitol? That was unexpected. **Art Bell:** Indeed it is, Raymond. Sightings of Lincoln’s ghost have been part of Washington lore for decades, but your encounter, and the senator's nonchalant acknowledgment of it, adds a fascinating layer to the narrative. It suggests that those who walk the corridors of power might be more familiar with its spectral residents than we realize. *Raymond’s story leaves a silence filled with contemplation and awe as Art gently ushers the show to a break.* **Art Bell:** As we take a moment to reflect, let’s ponder the implications of Raymond’s encounter. On this night, when the veil is thin, it seems fitting to consider the possibility that the spirits of our past leaders might still linger, perhaps offering silent counsel or simply ensuring the legacy of the republic endures. Stay with us.

Welcome back to \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" **Caller (Hank):** Hi Art, this is Hank from Colorado. Before the break, you were touching on historical hauntings, and it got me thinking about Flight 401 and the reports of crew members' spirits seen on other planes. **Art Bell:** Yes, Flight 401, a tragic accident, and the subsequent sightings are well-documented examples of possible spiritual imprints left behind, influencing the living world. It's a fascinating and chilling topic. **Hank:** Exactly, and that made me wonder—given the tragedies we've faced in space exploration, like the Challenger and Columbia disasters, do you think astronauts or even the Russian cosmonauts have experienced encounters with... let's say, ghost cosmonauts or astronauts, up there in the isolation of space? **Art Bell:** That's a profoundly intriguing question, Hank. The isolation and quiet of space, combined with the intense camaraderie felt by those who've traveled beyond our atmosphere, would create a potent environment for such encounters. Given the emotional and psychological extremities of space travel, if spirits are drawn to locations or people with whom they shared a strong bond, it seems conceivable that the crews of the Challenger, Columbia, or even the lost cosmonauts rumored from the Soviet era could be present in some form. **Hank:** Right, and considering the advancement in technologies, perhaps there have been instances where strange anomalies or unexplained phenomena were observed but kept under wraps, given the scientific nature of these missions. **Art Bell:** It wouldn't surprise me, Hank. The veil between the known and unknown seems thinnest at the edges of human experience and exploration. Space, being the ultimate frontier, harbors not just physical but metaphysical mysteries as well. The idea that those who gave their lives in the pursuit of exploring beyond could remain, in some form, to watch over or even guide their living counterparts is both haunting and heartening. **Hank:** Do you think, Art, that one day, we might hear stories from astronauts willing to share these encounters? Experiences that, for now, might be too outlandish for the public or even the scientific community to accept? **Art Bell:** I hold onto hope, Hank, that as we grow in our understanding of the universe, so too will we grow in our openness to the experiences that don't fit neatly into the boxes of conventional science. The astronauts and cosmonauts of today and tomorrow are not just explorers of space but of the human experience and consciousness. Their stories, if and when they choose to share them, could unravel mysteries that we've only begun to contemplate. *As the conversation with Hank concludes, Art pauses to let the implications of their dialogue sink in with his listeners.* **Art Bell:** Whether within the lonely expanses of our planet or the silent vacuum of space, the potential for encounters that stretch the boundaries of our understanding lies waiting. As we delve into these mysteries, let's keep our minds open to the impossible becoming possible. *With a brief fond farewell to Hank, Art moves the show forward, leaving his audience with thoughts of cosmic hauntings and the silent watchers who may yet drift among the stars, a testament to the courage and curiosity that propels humanity ever outward.* --- *This fictional segment captures \\"Coast to Coast AM's\\" spirit, blending the intrigue of paranormal phenomena with the infinite canvas of space exploration, inviting listeners to ponder the vast, unknown frontiers that lie both beyond our atmosphere and within the reaches of our understanding.*"},{"prompt":"Same Show: (Scottish Caller) - He drove down a remote Highland road, and passed the same village 5 times! - He didn't turn round, and there's only ONE road and ONE village..","completion":"# Transcript from the \\"Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell\\" - October 31, 1999: Halloween Special *Art Bell’s voice returns, a beacon through the mysteries of the night. The theme music fades into the background, setting the stage for another eerie tale.* **Art Bell:** Welcome back, dear listeners. On nights like these, our world seems to whisper secrets meant only for the bravest of souls. Joining us now is a caller from Scotland with a story that echoes the ancient mysteries of his homeland. Welcome to \\"Coast to Coast AM.\\" **Caller (Ian):** Hello, Art. Thank you for having me. It's Ian from Scotland here. I've got a tale that still chills me to think about. A few years ago, I was driving through the Highlands, a remote area known for its stunning landscapes and, well, its legends. **Art Bell:** The Scottish Highlands—a place ripe with history and mystery. Please, Ian, share your experience with us. **Ian:** I was on a single-track road, the only road that runs through this particular stretch of the wilderness. My destination was a small village where I planned to spend the night before continuing my travels. Now, Art, I've driven these roads more times than I can count, so I know them well. But that evening was different. **Art Bell:** Different how? **Ian:** Well, I reached the village just as the sun began to set - a quaint, lonely place that seems untouched by time. But as I drove through, planning to find the inn, I somehow ended up back on the open road, with the village behind me. Thinking I’d simply become distracted and driven past the inn, I turned around, only to drive through the village again, finding no end to it, only to emerge back onto the open road once more. **Art Bell:** And this happened repeatedly? **Ian:** Yes, five times, Art. Five times I passed through that village, never turning off the road, never finding the inn, and always ending up back on the road as if the village somehow looped me back to the start. There was no turning around, no forks in the road – it’s a straight shot through. **Art Bell:** Astonishing. It’s as though you were caught in a time loop or spatial anomaly. What was going through your mind? **Ian:** At first, confusion, then a creeping sense of fear. The Highlands are full of tales of the fae folk and otherworldly beings, but I’d never given much stock to them until that night. I wondered if I’d somehow angered the spirits or become stuck in their realm. **Art Bell:** How did you finally break free of this cycle? **Ian:** On the sixth attempt, I stopped the car before reaching the village, got out, and—I'm not ashamed to admit—I asked aloud for whatever had hold of me to let me go, to allow me to find my way. When I got back in the car and drove forward, the village appeared as normal. I found the inn, checked in, and when I mentioned my experience, the innkeeper just smiled and said, “Aye, it happens now and then. You’ve been fortunate; some never find their way back.” **Art Bell:** That is a truly haunting experience, Ian. It’s moments like these that remind us there is so much about our world that remains hidden, waiting just beyond the veil of our understanding. Thank you for sharing your encounter with us. **Ian:** Thank you, Art. It's a night I'll never forget, and a tale I thought your listeners might appreciate this Halloween. *As Ian's call concludes, Art takes a moment to reflect on the story, the mysteries of the night, and the ancient lands that still hold secrets yet to be understood.* **Art Bell:** To all wandering the paths less traveled, let Ian’s story be a reminder of the wonders and warnings whispered by the winds of history.

My name is Joseph, and I belong to a tribe in the Southwest. I want to share a cautionary tale, one that's been passed down through generations in my community. **Art Bell:** Joseph, I’m honored to have you share your story with us tonight. Please, go ahead. **Joseph:** It's about a particular location, a car park now, but once a place of significant spiritual importance to my people. A protector spirit, an ancestor, is believed to watch over it. The legend says that disrespecting the land, especially by leaving litter or causing harm, angers the spirit, bringing bad medicine to those who do. **Art Bell:** A poignant reminder of the sacredness of all places and the consequences of our actions. Have there been recent occurrences that bring this legend to light? **Joseph:** Yes, Art. Despite warnings, people continue to leave trash, desecrating the site. Strange occurrences have been reported: unexplained sounds, a sense of being watched, and even minor accidents. It’s the land reminding us, through the protector spirit, to respect it or face the consequences. **Art Bell:** A powerful message, Joseph, and an important one for us all to remember.

Porque Maria é imaculada. Use uma linguagem fortemente filosófica, com termos e palavras difíceis, tipo \\"posteriori\\", \\"isto é\\" etc.","completion":"A dogmática da Imaculada Conceição de Maria, isto é, a doutrina que postula a ausência original de pecado em Maria desde o seu primeiro instante de concepção, enraíza-se numa profunda exegese teológica e numa intrincada tapeçaria filosófica, que vai além do dogma proclamado ex cathedra pelo Papa Pio IX em 1854 na bula Ineffabilis Deus. Esta doutrina articula-se não apenas como um apogeu de veneração mariana, mas também como um corolário necessário da ontologia cristã, especialmente quando se considera a relação entre a natureza humana, a graça divina e a encarnação do Logos. A primazia de tal argumentação apoia-se num entendimento teleológico da criação e da redenção humana, na qual Maria ocupa uma posição singular, servindo como arcabouço para a incarnatio do Logos eterno. A premissa axiomática desta proposição é a sancta sanctis, ou seja, a necessidade de uma recipiente humano ser isenta de qualquer mácula de pecado (pecado original inclusivamente) para que possa encerrar em si o Verbo Divino, purus purum, isto é, a pureza absoluta engendrando a pureza. Em termos filosóficos, a tese da Imaculada Conceição de Maria dialoga profundamente com a noção de causa sui, onde Maria pode ser vista, de forma analógica, como uma causa secundária, não por gerar a si mesma, mas por ser preparada por Deus, sem a aplicação da culpa original, como um tabernáculo digno para o Deus feito homem. Esta excepcionalidade não é atribuída a um mérito pessoal de Maria, mas a uma ação antecipada da graça divina, uma aplicação singular do mérito redentor de Cristo, transcendendo o tempo ordinário mediante a omnipotência divina, que não é constrangida pelos limites temporais humanos. Adicionalmente, o argumento ex dignitate Christi sustenta que, para o Deus incarnado, seria incongruente nascer de uma mulher subjugada pelo pecado original, uma vez que isto implicaria uma forma de submissão, ainda que indiretamente, do Logos ao pecado, algo ontologicamente incompatível com a natureza divina. Portanto, Maria, ao ser preservada imaculada, constitui a única exceção à universidade do pecado original, isto é, o status peccati que aflige toda a humanidade desde a queda de Adão e Eva. Além disso, a doutrina da Imaculada Conceição reflete e amplifica a synergeia, ou seja, a cooperação entre a liberdade humana e a graça divina. Maria, ao dar o seu fiat, \\"Faça-se em mim segundo a tua palavra\\" (Lucas 1:38), exemplifica a receptividade perfeita à vontade divina, uma predisposição ontológica que só foi possível devido à ausência do pecado original e, por consequência, da concupiscência que a acompanha. Em suma, a Imaculada Conceição de Maria, longe de ser um mero adendo à teologia cristã, emerge como um postulado necessário que ressoa com profundas implicações soteriológicas, cristológicas e antropológicas. Esta doutrina não somente eleva o estatuto de Maria como Theotokos, a Mãe de Deus, mas também enfatiza o poder e a precedência da graça divina na ordem da salvação, estabelecendo um paradigma sublime para a compreensão da interseção entre a divindade e a humanidade."},{"prompt":"Agora use versículos para fortificar sua argumentação, e explique este versículo, também mostre que ela era cheia de graça e etc","completion":"Para ancorar teologicamente a doutrina da Imaculada Conceição de Maria utilizando as Sagradas Escrituras, um dos versículos primordiais é Lucas 1:28, onde o anjo Gabriel saúda Maria com as palavras: \\"Ave, cheia de graça, o Senhor é contigo.\\" Este versículo é fundamental para compreender a singularidade de Maria em relação à plenitude da graça divina. O termo grego usado, κεχαριτωμένη (kecharitomene), é uma forma verbal perfeita passiva particípio de χαριτόω (charitóō), que significa conceder ou dotar com graça. O uso do tempo perfeito aqui indica uma ação completa com efeitos contínuos no tempo presente, sugerindo que Maria foi agraciada de maneira plena e permanente. Esta graça não é meramente circunstancial ou temporal, mas atesta de um estado singular e completo de graça, que, segundo a compreensão teológica, antecede sua concepção e nascimento, corroborando a doutrina de sua Imaculada Conceição. Além disso, Efésios 1:4, \\"Assim como nos escolheu nele antes da fundação do mundo, para sermos santos e irrepreensíveis diante dele em amor\\", embora não se refira diretamente a Maria, tem sido utilizado para expandir a compreensão da predestinação e da presciência divina. Por analogia, este versículo auxilia na compreensão de como Maria poderia ser concebida sem pecado. Se Deus, na sua onisciência, escolheu os eleitos para serem santos e irrepreensíveis antes da fundação do mundo, não estaria, então, dentro da ordem divina providencial, a possibilidade de Maria ser preservada da mancha do pecado original desde sua concepção, para servir ao propósito supremo de ser a Mãe do Salvador? Adicionalmente, em Gênesis 3:15, no contexto da narrativa da queda e da promessa de redenção, Deus diz à serpente: \\"Porei inimizade entre ti e a mulher, entre a tua descendência e a dela; esta te ferirá a cabeça e tu lhe ferirás o calcanhar.\\" Este versículo, historicamente interpretado como o Protoevangelium, ou seja, a primeira promessa do Evangelho, tem sido visto pela tradição cristã como aludindo à vitória final de Jesus sobre Satanás, com Maria sendo essa \\"mulher\\" em posições teológicas marianas. A inimizade colocada entre a mulher (Maria) e a serpente (Satanás) subentende uma oposição completa ao pecado desde o início, o que fortalece a compreensão de sua imaculada conceição, estando ela isenta do pecado original, que a teria colocado sob influência de Satanás. Por fim, a consciência da plena graça em Maria e sua concepção imaculada não apenas a define como singularmente abençoada entre todas as mulheres, mas cria um fundamento teológico para a natureza hipostática de Cristo — verdadeiro Deus e verdadeiro homem —, nascido de uma mulher que foi, desde sempre, predestinada a ser a arca da nova Aliança, imune à corrupção do pecado, um vaso digno para portar a presença divina em seu ventre. Assim, a doutrina da Imaculada Conceição de Maria se solidifica nas fundações da crença cristã, não apenas como um tributo à sua santidade, mas também como um alicerce essencial para a compreensão da Encarnação do próprio Deus."},{"prompt":"Mostre também um versículo que diz \\"Maria, mãe de meu senhor\\"","completion":"O versículo que você procura encontra-se em Lucas 1:43, dentro do contexto do Novo Testamento, no episódio onde Maria visita sua prima Isabel. Ao encontrar Maria, Isabel, cheia do Espírito Santo, exclama: \\"Mas por que isto me acontece, para que venha ter comigo a mãe do meu Senhor?\\" Esta pergunta retórica expressa por Isabel sublinha não apenas o reconhecimento da singularidade e santidade de Maria, mas também o papel crucial que ela desempenha na história da salvação como a mãe do Messias, o Senhor. Este versículo é de suma importância para a teologia e a cristologia, pois Isabel, sob a inspiração do Espírito Santo, identifica Maria como \\"a mãe do meu Senhor\\". A expressão \\"meu Senhor\\" (κυρίου μου) é uma clara referência messiânica e divina, implicando que o filho que Maria está gestando não é outro senão Deus encarnado, a segunda pessoa da Santíssima Trindade. A declaração de Isabel, portanto, fornece um testemunho bíblico precoce da divindade de Cristo e afirma o papel único de Maria na economia da salvação. Além disso, o reconhecimento de Isabel da presença do Senhor no ventre de Maria antes mesmo do nascimento de Jesus enfatiza a realidade da Encarnação desde a concepção. Isso reitera a crença na concepção virginal de Jesus, um pilar fundamental da cristologia que sublinha a ação direta de Deus na história da salvação humana. Ao mesmo tempo, este versículo fortalece a Doutrina da Imaculada Conceição ao indicar a graça especial concedida a Maria desde a concepção, preparando-a para ser a morada pura e santa do Altíssimo. Portanto, Lucas 1:43 não só honra Maria, reconhecendo-a como a mãe do Senhor, mas também sustenta fundamentos teológicos profundos sobre a natureza de Cristo e o plano de salvação divino, realçando o papel central de Maria neste mistério. A vocação de Maria, confirmada pela saudação de Isabel, estabelece uma ponte entre o Antigo e o Novo Testamento, unindo a promessa divina e seu cumprimento na pessoa de Jesus Cristo, fundamentando assim a veneração especial dedicada a Maria na tradição cristã."},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical - Write the account of a 'close encounter' a driver had with a 7ft tall alien in a pink catsuit, that looked like a very tall drag queen :)","completion":"On a warm, star-filled summer night, Eddie was driving down a long, deserted stretch of highway, his old truck humming through the silence. Eddie, a long-haul trucker, was no stranger to the road's solitude or its unpredictable happenings. However, nothing in his years of driving could have prepared him for what was about to unfold. The clock had just struck midnight when something on the horizon caught Eddie's eye. A bright, pulsating light that wasn't there a moment ago made him squint, his hands tightening around the steering wheel. As he approached, the light grew intensely until it suddenly vanished, leaving behind an eerie glow that illuminated the road ahead. Eddie slowed down, curiosity piqued, peering into the darkness for an explanation. Then, as if stepping out of the shadows themselves, a figure appeared in the glow, causing Eddie to slam on his brakes. There, in the middle of the road, stood a creature unlike any he had ever seen. Towering at least 7 feet tall, the being was clad in a shimmering pink catsuit that hugged its slender, oddly proportioned frame. The creature's skin was a light, iridescent color, and its large, almond-shaped eyes sparkled under the moonlight, giving it an ethereal yet somewhat familiar appearance. Eddie's heart raced as he stared in disbelief. The being walked towards his truck with a grace that belied its size, moving as if on air. Its face bore an expression of curiosity, not malice, which somewhat eased Eddie's initial panic. Then, the creature did something wholly unexpected: it smiled, revealing a row of perfectly human-like teeth. \\"Eddie,\\" the being spoke, its voice a melodious blend of tones. \\"Do not be afraid.\\" Eddie was taken aback. \\"How do you know my name?\\" he managed to stutter, his voice barely a whisper. \\"We've been watching, learning,\\" the creature replied, its voice soothing. \\"Our intentions are peaceful.\\" The next few minutes felt like an eternity as the being, who introduced itself as Zara, explained its presence. Zara was from a distant world, one where expressions of identity were celebrated in all forms, hence the choice of a vibrant catsuit, reminiscent of Earth's drag queen culture which Zara found profoundly beautiful and empowering. Eddie, while initially bewildered, found himself engrossed in the conversation that touched on topics from cosmic journeys to the shared values of love and acceptance across the galaxies. Zara spoke of Earth with a fondness that warmed Eddie's heart, its observations insightful and kind. The encounter, though brief, left a lasting mark on Eddie. Before departing, Zara reached out, placing a gentle, three-fingered hand on his shoulder, saying, \\"Remember, Eddie, the universe is vast, and love is its most precious commodity.\\" With that, the pink-clad figure stepped back, and in a blink of an eye, was enveloped in a beam of light that shot into the night sky, leaving no trace behind but a deep sense of wonder in Eddie's heart. As Eddie continued his journey, the world around him seemed different, touched by the magic of his encounter. He realized that out there in the vast expanse of the universe, amidst stars and planets unknown, there were beings who viewed life through a lens of beauty, kindness, and understanding. The memory of his close encounter with Zara, the 7ft tall alien in a pink catsuit, stayed with Eddie for the rest of his days, a beacon of hope in the ever-expansive universe, reminding him that we are not alone in our quest for love and acceptance."},{"prompt":"could you write an anime movie based on Ralph Bakshi's Cool World","completion":"Title: **Harmony in Chaos** **Genre:** Fantasy, Action, Anime **Synopsis:** In the neon-lit, animated metropolis of Cool World, humans and doodles (animated characters) exist in a delicate balance, governed by a set of ancient laws.

Max and Lola decide to confront their forbidden love's consequences head-on, embarking on a quest to find the mythical \\"Creator's Pen,\\" a powerful artifact said to have the ability to rewrite the laws of their worlds. **Act 3:** Their journey is fraught with trials that test their love, beliefs, and very existence. Along the way, they meet allies from both worlds, including Spindle, a wise-cracking doodle sidekick, and Lisa, a human scientist who believes there might be a scientific explanation for their predicament. Together, they uncover that The Inkman is a creation of a disgruntled animator who felt his ideas were too avant-garde for either world. In an epic showdown at The Inkman's fortress, Max and Lola manage to use the Creator's Pen not to rewrite the laws but to bring about understanding and acceptance between the two worlds. They show that love, in its purest form, can transcend any boundary, creating harmony from chaos. **Epilogue:** As both worlds begin to heal and integrate more freely, Max and Lola decide to part ways, understanding that their relationship can now inspire others to bridge the gap between worlds, rather than divide them. However, they remain connected in spirit, forever changed by their journey. Cool World and the human world learn to coexist, celebrating their differences and shared dreams, under a new era of peace and creativity. --- The anime adaptation of Ralph Bakshi's *Cool World* adds depth to the original narrative, highlighting the power of love and understanding in overcoming barriers. By respecting the essence of Bakshi's work while introducing new elements typical of anime, such as a strong emphasis on emotional storytelling and action-packed sequences, *Harmony in Chaos* serves as a bridge between cultures and genres."},{"prompt":"Did Randy Gardner laid down in bed during the sleep deprivation","completion":"Randy Gardner, known for his record-breaking 264-hour (about 11 days) sleep deprivation experiment in 1964, did not adhere to a strict protocol of never lying down. While the primary goal was to stay awake for as long as possible, comfort measures like lying down or sitting comfortably might have been used so long as they did not lead to sleep. The key factor in Gardner's experiment was the avoidance of sleep, not necessarily the avoidance of being in a horizontal position. Therefore, while detailed accounts of his day-to-day activities are sparse, it wouldn't be unlikely that he might have laid down at times, provided he remained awake. The experiment aimed to observe the effects of sleep deprivation, and activities including playing basketball, watching TV, and taking short walks were used to keep him awake. The presence of those monitoring him, including his friend Bruce McAllister and Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement, helped ensure that Gardner stayed awake throughout the experiment."},{"prompt":"could you write Ralph Bakshi's Cool World but with an teen films, anime, and video game style to it.","completion":"Title: *Pixel Haven* *Synopsis:* In a universe where the realms of high school drama, anime aesthetics, and video game mechanics seamlessly blend, an urban legend circulates about a mysterious digital world known as Pixel Haven.

Little does he know, his creation is the key to another universe. - **Cyra**: A fierce and independent game character designed by Alex. She possesses knowledge beyond her programming and seeks Alex's help to save her world from a digital apocalypse. - **Vector**: The antagonist of \\"Pixelated Dimensions,\\" an AI that was designed to challenge players but has gone rogue, seeking control over both the digital and real worlds. - **Tara**: Alex's best friend in the real world. She's tech-savvy, supportive, and joins Alex in his journey across dimensions. **Plot**: Act 1: The film opens on Alex, who is seen working tirelessly on his game. Upon completion, he discovers an anomaly. This glitch in the game turns out to be a portal that transports him into the game world. There, he meets Cyra, who tells him about Vector's plan to breach into the real world. Act 2: Alex, struggling to grasp his new reality, decides to help Cyra. They embark on a quest to gather the three sacred pixels, each hidden in different levels of the game world, which are key to defeating Vector. Along the way, Tara gets sucked into the game world and joins their quest, bringing her knowledge of the real world to their advantage. Each level mimics a different genre of video games - from platformers and RPGs to racing and puzzle games, offering a rich variety of challenges and environments. The worlds are populated by NPCs (non-playable characters) who add depth and humor to the story, reflecting on their existence and the line between AI and consciousness. Act 3: With the sacred pixels in hand, Alex, Cyra, and Tara face Vector in an epic showdown spanning both the digital and real world. The boundaries between the two worlds weaken, causing havoc in Alex's town as game elements start to manifest in reality. In the climax, Alex realizes that the true power to defeat Vector lies in accepting the duality of their worlds and the unity between creator and creation. With a newfound understanding and the help of his friends, both digital and real, Alex reprograms Vector, not to destroy him, but to reintegrate him as a guardian of the digital world. Epilogue: The worlds are saved, but the portal remains open, allowing interaction and travel between them. Alex's game becomes a sensation, heralded not just for its gameplay but for showing the interconnectedness of our realities. Cyra and other game characters gain autonomy, visiting the real world, and helping Alex to develop new games, forever blurring the lines between the player and the played. **Visual Style**: The film employs a mix of 2D and 3D animation, reflecting the variety of video game worlds explored. The real world is depicted in a more traditional, perhaps slightly exaggerated 2D animation style, while the game world(s) utilize vibrant 3D graphics reminiscent of cutting-edge video games. The transition between the two is smooth yet distinct, with each world having its unique aesthetic and rules, paying homage to the iconic style of Ralph Bakshi with a modern twist. **Conclusion**: \\"Pixelated Dimensions\\" is a teen film that delves into the heart of creativity, friendship, and the thin line between reality and the digital universe. It captures the essence of video game culture and the boundless potential for imagination, wrapped in a visually stunning package that appeals to both gamers and non-gamers alike."},{"prompt":"could you write movie of Ralph Bakshi's Cool World but is an video game.","completion":"**Cool World: Collision Course** - A Video Game Concept **Genre:** Action-Adventure with RPG Elements **Platform:** PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch **Storyline:** In \\"Cool World: Collision Course,\\" the players are thrust into a universe where the real world and the animated world of Cool World are on the brink of colliding, threatening the balance of both realities.

The story revolves around a cartoonist named Jack Deebs (played by Gabriel Byrne), who creates a comic strip called \\"Cool World.\\" Unbeknownst to him, Cool World actually exists as a parallel universe inhabited by \\"Doodles\\" (cartoon characters) and \\"Noids\\" (humans). Jack finds himself sucked into Cool World, where he meets a seductive doodle named Holli Would (voiced by Kim Basinger), who dreams of becoming human. The film explores themes of desire, creativity, and the consequences of crossing boundaries between reality and fantasy. Unlike Bakshi's earlier, more adult-focused animations, \\"Cool World\\" aimed for a broader audience, integrating elements of comedy, fantasy, and noir. However, it also received criticism for its storyline, mixed animation styles, and perceived lack of coherence. \\"Cool World\\" is notable for its attempt to blend live-action with animation, in a period shortly after the success of \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" (1988). Despite its ambitions and the talent involved, including Brad Pitt in an early role as Detective Frank Harris, the film was not well-received critically or commercially at the time of its release. Nonetheless, \\"Cool World\\" has gained a cult following over the years, with some fans appreciating its unique visual style and the unconventional narrative choices characteristic of Bakshi's work."},{"prompt":"could you rewrite this as an video game in the movie with an man named Jack deebs play it in the PC in an viral world.","completion":"In this reimagined version, \\"Cool World\\" is a groundbreaking video game that blurs the lines between the digital and the real. The game, created by a brilliant but obscure developer, constructs a vibrant virtual world known as Cool World, populated by Doodles (animated characters) and Noids (digital representations of humans). The protagonist, Jack Deebs, is a dedicated gamer and a budding developer himself, who stumbles upon Cool World while searching for inspiration on his computer. As Jack delves deeper into the game, he discovers that Cool World is more than just lines of code and digital art—it's a living, breathing universe that reacts to his decisions and actions. He becomes obsessed with exploring its vast landscapes, complex characters, and intricate stories. The plot thickens when Jack encounters Holli Would, a Doodle with ambitions that defy the programmed norms of her existence. She seeks to transcend her digital boundaries and achieve sentience in the real world. Driven by empathy and curiosity, Jack is torn between his desire to help Holli and the potentially catastrophic consequences of interfering with the game's core mechanics. As the lines between reality and the virtual world begin to blur, Jack finds himself caught in a web of intrigue, ethics, and existential questions. He must navigate the challenges thrown at him by both the real world and the digital denizens of Cool World. His journey challenges the player to consider the implications of virtual consciousness, the morality of creation, and the intrinsic value of artificial life. The gameplay mechanics revolve around puzzles, decision-making, and exploration, with the player's choices affecting the narrative's direction and the fate of both Cool World and the real world. As Jack, players are drawn into an immersive experience that questions the very nature of reality, identity, and art. This version of \\"Cool World\\" transforms the original film's concept into an interactive narrative, engaging the player in a thought-provoking adventure that marries the complexities of virtual realities with the perennial quest for understanding and connection."},{"prompt":"\\"I knew I need to add a little bit of a Max Fosh spin on the game\\" explain please, analyze the structure","completion":"The sentence you provided, \\"I knew I needed to add a little bit of a Max Fosh spin on the game,\\" can be analyzed for its structure and intent. Here's a breakdown: 1. **Subject and Verb**: The subject of the sentence is \\"I,\\" referring to the speaker or writer. The main verb is \\"knew,\\" indicating a past realization or understanding by the speaker. 2. **Object Clause**: The object of the verb \\"knew\\" is a clause: \\"I needed to add a little bit of a Max Fosh spin on the game.\\" This clause serves as the content of the knowledge the speaker had. Within this clause, there's another verb \\"needed,\\" indicating a past requirement or necessity experienced by the speaker. 3. **Infinitive Phrase**: \\"to add a little bit of a Max Fosh spin on the game\\" is an infinitive phrase functioning as the object of the verb \\"needed,\\" explaining what the speaker felt the need to do. The infinitive \\"to add\\" expresses purpose or intention. 4. **Direct Object**: The direct object of \\"to add\\" is \\"a little bit of a Max Fosh spin,\\" a phrase that describes what the speaker intended to add. This phrase itself contains several nested elements: - \\"a little bit of\\" is a quantifier expressing that only a small quantity or aspect of the subsequent noun phrase will be added. - \\"a Max Fosh spin\\" is a noun phrase acting as the object of the preposition \\"of.\\" It is composed of: - \\"Max Fosh\\" acting as a modifier, specifying whose spin or unique style is being added. Max Fosh is presumably a person known for a unique approach or style. - \\"spin\\" is the noun, in this context likely referring metaphorically to a unique, personal twist, interpretation, or approach. 5. **Prepositional Phrase**: \\"on the game\\" is a prepositional phrase indicating where or to what the Max Fosh spin is being added. \\"On\\" indicates the target or subject to which the spin is applied, and \\"the game\\" specifies that target more concretely, suggesting that the context involves a game or possibly a broader metaphorical 'game' such as a project, idea, or endeavor. 6. **Implication and Context**: Without specific knowledge about who Max Fosh is, one can infer that he is known for a particular style, approach, or creativity that the speaker wished to emulate or incorporate into \\"the game\\" (which can be a literal game, an event, a project, etc.). The speaker recognizes a unique value in that style and believes that adding a \\"spin\\" or personal touch inspired by Max Fosh would improve or enhance the game. 7. **Tense and Aspect**: The sentence is in the past tense, indicating that the speaker's realization and decision happened in the past. This suggests reflection on a past action or decision-making process. The structure and elements of the sentence work together to convey not just an action but an intention and inspiration drawn from another person's distinctive style or approach. It implies an admiration for Max Fosh and an aspiration to incorporate some of that distinctiveness into another realm or project."},{"prompt":"so spin here is like my take on something?","completion":"Yes, exactly. In this context, \\"spin\\" refers to a unique interpretation, perspective, or approach to something. It's a way of adding a personal touch or a distinctive angle to an existing concept, idea, game, or project. When someone mentions putting \\"their spin\\" on something, it implies they are adding their own ideas, creativity, or flair to make it somewhat different from the original or from what others might do. So, when the sentence says \\"a Max Fosh spin,\\" it suggests incorporating Max Fosh's unique take, style, or perspective into the game, aiming to add value or a novel aspect through his distinctive approach."},{"prompt":"Hello there!","completion":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"I want to visualize my sentence embedding model from Hugging Face. How can I do this? I also have metadata","completion":"Visualizing sentence embeddings is an excellent way to understand the kind of information captured by your model and how sentences are being clustered or separated based on their meanings or other characteristics. To visualize sentence embeddings from a Hugging Face model, particularly if you also have metadata associated with these embeddings, you can follow these steps, integrating TensorBoard for a more interactive exploration. **1. Generate Embeddings:** First, you need to use your model to generate embeddings for the sentences you wish to visualize. For instance, if you're using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's Transformers library, you can do the following: \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel import torch # Replace 'model_name' with your model's name tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\\"model_name\\") model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\\"model_name\\") # Assume 'sentences' is a list of sentences for which you want embeddings inputs = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\\"pt\\", max_length=512) with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(**inputs) # Extract embeddings, for example, taking the mean of the last hidden state embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).numpy() \`\`\` **2. Preparing Metadata:** Your metadata should be in a format that can be easily utilized alongside the embeddings. A simple way is to have a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file where each line corresponds to the metadata for each sentence. For example: \`\`\`plaintext Sentence1_MetaInfo ExtraInfo1 Sentence2_MetaInfo ExtraInfo2 ... \`\`\` **3. Using TensorBoard for Visualization:** TensorBoard's Embedding Projector allows you to visualize high-dimensional embeddings. It can also utilize your metadata files for a richer exploration. First, install TensorBoard if you haven't already: \`\`\`bash pip install tensorboard \`\`\` Then, you can prepare your embeddings and metadata for visualization: \`\`\`python import tensorboard as tb from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter import os # Directory where you want to save your embeddings and metadata log_dir = \\"path_to_log_dir\\" if not os.path.exists(log_dir): os.makedirs(log_dir) # Initialize a SummaryWriter writer = SummaryWriter(log_dir) # Save embeddings and metadata # Assuming 'embeddings' is a numpy array from the step above and you have 'meta_data.tsv' writer.add_embedding(embeddings, metadata='path_to_meta_data.tsv', tag=\\"Sentences\\") writer.close() \`\`\` **4. Running TensorBoard:** Finally, you can run TensorBoard to explore your embeddings interactively. Open your terminal and type: \`\`\`bash tensorboard --logdir=path_to_log_dir \`\`\` Replace \`path_to_log_dir\` with the actual path where you saved your embeddings and metadata. Open the URL displayed in your terminal (usually it's http://localhost:6006) in your web browser to visualize and interact with your embeddings. **5. Exploring Data:** In TensorBoard's Embedding Projector, you can: - Search for specific points using metadata. - Inspect clusters of sentences and see how they're grouped. - Experiment with different dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP) to see how they affect the visualization. This process gives you a hands-on way to explore and understand the semantic space created by your sentence embedding model, leveraging both the quantitative aspects through embeddings and qualitative aspects through metadata."},{"prompt":"could you write a sequel of Ralph Bakshi's Cool World but with Holli Would returns to take cool world again.","completion":"Title: Cool World: Return of Holli **Synopsis** Years after the events that shook the balance between the animated realm of Cool World and the human world, a newfound peace has blossomed, overseen by the guardians who ensure the realms do not dangerously merge.

Her ambition hasn't waned; her desires have only magnified, plotting to not only take over Cool World but to bridge an irreversible connection to the human world. **Act 1: Signs of Disruption** The film opens with Cool World in harmony. Frank Harris (Brad Pitt) and Lonette are now the guardians of the portal, ensuring no human or doodle crosses over unlawinally. However, strange anomalies begin occurring—doodles acting out of character, and parts of Cool World glitching, reverting to a noir palette akin to Holli’s era. A mysterious human, Alex, a comic book illustrator with a fascination for cool world stories, stumbles upon a peculiar sketch in an antique shop—unbeknownst to him, a sketch by Holli Would herself. This sketch, imbued with her essence, becomes the bridge for Holli's return. **Act 2: Holli’s Scheme** Holli's essence infiltrates Alex's dreams, manipulating him to complete a ritual that would bring her back to full power. Alex, entranced by the allure of Holli, unknowingly sets her free, only to realize her true intentions—to fuse Cool World with the human realm, allowing her to rule over both. Frank and Lonette catch wind of Holli’s return and the impending doom. They reach out to Jack Deebs (Gabriel Byrne), the creator, imprisoned within his own creation, seeking his knowledge on possibly stopping Holli for good. Deebs points them towards an ancient doodle artifact, the only thing capable of counteracting Holli's power. **Act 3: The Battle for Worlds** A race against time ensues, with Holli amassing followers from both realms, promising them freedom from their respective confines. Frank, Lonette, Deebs, and a remorseful Alex, embark on a treacherous journey to the depths of Cool World, discovering allies in unlikely places—doodles tired of Holli's promises leading to chaos. The final battle is a spectacle of animated prowess and human resilience. As Holli nearly succeeds in merging the worlds, Frank confronts her, pleading for her to see the beauty in their unique existences. Holli, for a moment, falters, her vision blurred by the love she once sought. In that moment of distraction, Alex uses the artifact, encapsulating Holli's essence once more. **Epilogue: A New Dawn** With Holli Would once again contained, albeit in a new form, peace is restored. A new guardian is appointed—Alex, having proven his dedication to Cool World's preservation. Frank and Lonette step down, opting for a quieter life within Cool World, as Jack Deebs returns to the human world, his connection to Cool World forever a part of him but no longer his prison. The film closes with Cool World and the human world existing in harmony, the portal vigilantly watched, ensuring that the temptation of crossing over is kept at bay.

It’s gonna be all that and a bag of chips! **DRAKE** (17, sporting a pair of sunglasses indoors): Don’t go mental, but I swiped my bro’s Tamagotchi. We can feed it until midnight! The group laughs and gathers around DRAKE, passing the Tamagotchi around and pressing the buttons. **TINA** (15, wearing a mood ring and a Spice Girls T-shirt): Let’s not forget to record this on my Talkboy for posterity, peeps. Future aliens gotta know how we rolled! She holds up the Talkboy, and everyone cheers, striking poses. The TV host announces the final minute before the year 2000. The teens gather around the television, their excitement palpable as they begin the countdown. **ALL TEENS TOGETHER**: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... Happy New Year!!! As they shout “Happy New Year,” a FLASH OF LIGHT from the TV envelops the room. **CUT TO BLACK.** When the lights come back on, the basement—and the teenagers—are transformed. The decor now features posters of \\"The OC\\", \\"Mean Girls\\", and Blink-182. The teens, too, have changed; their clothes are tighter, their hair straighter or spikier. **JOEY** (now styled with frosted tips and a popped collar): Yo, peeps, this crib is off the hook! Time to crank some tunes on this iPod. Who’s got the aux? **AMBER** (in a Juicy Couture tracksuit): That’s hot! Let’s put on some Lady Gaga and get this party poppin’. And later, we can totally update our MySpace profiles. **DRAKE** (now with a Bluetooth earpiece): Chill, Amber. First, let’s snap some pics with my new digicam for our Friendster accounts. Gotta show off our bling! **TINA** (sporting a “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt): Fo shizzle, my nizzle! But don’t forget, we need to download the latest Napster tracks for the ultimate playlist. They quickly adapt to their new gadgets, taking pictures and laughing, the transformation seemingly unnoticed. **JOEY**: Hey, squad, let’s make a pact. No matter what happens, we’ll always be tight. The 2000s are gonna be da bomb, for real. **AMBER, DRAKE, TINA**: Fo’ sho’! They group hug, a mix of excitement and camaraderie in the air. **AMBER**: So, what’s the 411? What else is on the agenda for our first day in the 2000s? **DRAKE**: Let’s roll to the mall tomorrow. I heard they just opened an Abercrombie & Fitch. **TINA**: And don't forget to Tivo “Survivor” tonight! It’s supposed to be epic. Laughing and joking, they continue to celebrate, now fully immersed in their new millennium personas. **FADE OUT.** **THE END.**"},{"prompt":":<div style=\\"clear: both; text-align: right;\\"><p> سياسة الخصوصية لـ <b><a href=\\"https://net0trends.blogspot.com/?m=1\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Net Trends</a></b></p><p> إذا كنت بحاجة إلى أي مزيد من المعلومات أو لديك أية أسئلة عن سياسة الخصوصية ، لا تتردد في الاتصال بنا عن طريق نموذج الإتصال التالي <b><a href=\\"<h2 id=\\"_معاينة_صفحة_اتصل_بنا:_\\"> معاينة صفحة اتصل بنا: </h2><h2 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" id=\\"مرحبًا_بك_في_\\"اسم_الموقع\\"!\\">مرحبًا بك في <span id=\\"W_Name\\">Net Trends</span>!</h2><p style=\\"font-size: 17px;\\"> إذا كانت لديك أي استفسارات حول الموقع أو الإعلانات أو أي قضية أخرى، فلا تتردد في الاتصال بنا. </p><div style=\\"text-align: center;\\"><img alt=\\"اتصل بنا\\" decoding=\\"async\\" height=\\"87\\" src=\\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVdfYhrCntKebCbEmNfAW-cU2WAwqwIfSo2LXlRGNd38zBVjcPHt6x8CG1ML5aN-l2Et2cxkWreeytXSGbg6wUPXVuzIV7KL1Zk4zyzOMdO53vt0hyBNCCjNGZuQUEFa-7gPC1nFvEa4HO/h120-rw/contact-us.png.webp\\" width=\\"320\\"><p><i class=\\"fas fa-envelope-open-text\\" style=\\"color: #2c3e50;

Neon lights flicker in the background as the city prepares to shift from a wartime economy to a peacetime oasis of gambling and entertainment. In this transition, a story of ambition, tragedy, and the birth of an alternate reality unfolds. **Chapter 1: Aftermath of War** Frank Harris, a decorated World War II veteran, finds himself wandering the streets of Las Vegas, lost in the aftermath of the war. His heroics on the battlefield seem distant memories as he struggles to adjust to civilian life. The city, with its burgeoning casino scene, offers a stark contrast to the horrors he has witnessed. Yet, the bright lights and promise of a new beginning captivate him. **Chapter 2: The Gambler’s Fortune** One night, Frank's fate takes a significant turn when he crosses paths with a mysterious gambler known only as \\"The Artist\\". The Artist is rumored to hold the power to change lives through a curious blend of art and magic. Intrigued by Frank's history and depth of character, The Artist introduces him to a secret high-stakes game where the stakes go beyond mere money—they gamble with the fabric of reality itself. **Chapter 3: Drawing the First Line** In a smoke-filled room, amidst the clinking of chips and the shuffling of cards, Frank finds himself drawn into The Artist's world. Here, he is offered a chance to “draw” his destiny. A single sketch, The Artist explains, can bring one’s deepest desires to life. In a moment of weakness, fueled by alcohol and the seductive promise of creating a perfect world, Frank draws. His hand, guided by a mixture of inspiration and desperation, brings forth the earliest contours of what would become the Cool World. **Chapter 4: The Birth of Cool World** As the sketch takes form, reality begins to warp. The dingy backroom of the casino transforms into a gateway between worlds. Frank, accompanied by The Artist, steps into the nascent Cool World, a place born from human desires but untamed and chaotic. It's a realm of endless possibilities, shaped by the collective consciousness of its creators and inhabitants. **Chapter 5: Sin City's Shadow** The existence of Cool World remains a secret to most, but its influence on Las Vegas grows. Frank, now acting as both guardian and link between the two worlds, finds that his creation is not the paradise he imagined. The realm begins to attract souls from our world—those seeking escape, power, or simply something beyond the mundane. Among these is Holli Would, a manifestation of desires too complex and dark for Frank to have ever intended. **Chapter 6: The Rift Widens** As the years pass, the boundary between Las Vegas and Cool World becomes increasingly blurred. Frank realizes that his creation, while a place of wonder, also harbors darkness capable of spilling over into reality. Conflicts arise, alliances form, and the fabric of both worlds starts to strain under the weight of their intertwined destinies. **Chapter 7: Legacy of the Sketch** Frank Harris stands at the apex of two realities, haunted by the consequences of his moment of weakness. As Las Vegas continues to evolve into a haven of sin and spectacle, Cool World festers with its own internal struggles. The line between creator and creation, reality and fantasy, right and wrong, becomes ever more obscured. **Closing Scene:** The camera pulls back from an aged, weary Frank staring out over the Las Vegas skyline. The glittering lights reflect in his eyes, a mirror to the chaotic energy of Cool World. He sighs, a silent acknowledgment of the dual legacies he's forged. The screen fades to black, the boundaries between both worlds momentarily forgotten, as the origins of Cool World lie in wait for the next chapter to unfold. --- **Cool World: The Origins of Sin City** serves as a prelude to the chaotic intertwining of realities introduced in Ralph Bakshi's animated-live action hybrid. It dives deep into the psyche of Frank Harris and the pivotal moment that birthed a world, setting the stage for the unrestrained desires and moral complexities that would later define Cool World."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical mid 1980's advert for a Breakfast cereal called \\"Astromunch\\" - with a cartoonish three antennaed mascot, explaining what's in Astromunch!...","completion":"**[Scene: A brightly colored outer space background.

Cependant, une idée prometteuse basée sur les tendances et les progrès technologiques jusqu'à aujourd'hui serait un projet axé sur l'intelligence artificielle (IA) éthique et accessible, notamment l'IA comme service (IAaaS) pour les petites et moyennes entreprises (PME). # Pourquoi l'IA comme service pour les PME ? 1. **Accessibilité de l'IA** : Bien que l'intelligence artificielle continue de transformer de nombreux secteurs d'activité, la barrière technique et financière pour son adoption reste un défi significatif pour les PME. Un service qui démocratise l'accès à l'IA personnalisable et abordable pourrait avoir un impact majeur. 2. **Personnalisation et Évolutivité** : Une plateforme qui permet aux PME de personnaliser les solutions d'IA en fonction de leurs besoins spécifiques sans nécessiter une expertise technique approfondie serait particulièrement attrayante. Elle pourrait aider ces entreprises à rester compétitives, à optimiser leurs opérations, et à proposer de nouveaux services ou produits innovants. 3. **Éthique et Transparence** : Les questions éthiques autour de l'IA, notamment la confidentialité des données, le biais algorithmique et la transparence des processus décisionnels, deviennent de plus en plus importantes. Un projet qui met l'accent sur une IA éthique, expliquable et conforme aux réglementations (comme le RGPD en Europe) répondrait à une demande croissante pour des technologies responsables. 4. **Écosystème et Communauté** : Créer une plateforme qui facilite non seulement l'accès à l'IA, mais qui encourage également une communauté d'utilisateurs, de développeurs et d'experts à collaborer, partager des meilleures pratiques, et co-créer des solutions, pourrait amplifier son impact et sa durabilité. # Facteurs Clés de Succès - **Simplicité d'utilisation** : Une interface utilisateur intuitive et des processus simplifiés pour l'intégration et l'utilisation de l'IA. - **Affordabilité** : Un modèle de tarification clair qui rend l'IA accessible aux budgets limités des PME. - **Support et Formation** : Des ressources pour aider les utilisateurs à optimiser leur utilisation de l'IA, y compris des formations, des tutoriels, et un support client réactif. # Conclusion Bien que ce projet soit prometteur, son succès dépendra de l'exécution, de la capacité à s'adapter aux besoins en évolution, et de l'environnement concurrentiel en 2024.

The air pulses with the energy of a city celebrating the end of World War II. Among the crowds is FRANK HARRIS, a young, decorated veteran, grappling with his return to civilian life. Haunted by the war, Frank seeks solace in his childhood love for drawing.* Frank visits a local jazz club, where the music and the atmosphere inspire him. Amid the smoky haze and lively tunes, he sketches on napkins - visions of another world, vibrant and alive with cartoon characters. His talent catches the eye of HOLLI, a spirited and ambitious young woman with dreams of stardom. She sees potential in Frank's art, suggesting they collaborate on a comic strip. **ACT 2: THE CREATION OF HOLLI** As Frank and Holli grow closer, their collaboration flourishes. Frank creates a universe unlike any other - a parallel dimension he calls \\"Cool World\\". At its center is a character inspired by Holli - a seductive and ambitious cartoon singer named \\"Holli Would\\", who dreams of becoming human. However, as their work progresses, creative differences and Holli's growing obsession with fame strain their relationship. Holli wants Cool World to be a gateway to her stardom, while Frank sees it as an escape from reality, a place where the horrors of war don't exist. **ACT 3: THE TURNING POINT** One night, after a heated argument, Holli storms out. Alone, Frank's sketches take on a life of their own. The lines blur between creator and creation, and Frank finds himself transported to Cool World for the first time. In this animated realm, he meets the cartoon version of Holli Would. She's everything Holli wanted to be - captivating, celebrated, but also deeply conflicted and trapped by her own ambitions. Frank realizes that Cool World is more than just drawings; it's a living, breathing dimension where his actions have consequences. He sees the potential dangers of this crossover but is also enchanted by the cartoon realm and its inhabitants. **ACT 4: THE LEGACY AND THE LOSS** Back in the real world, Frank tries to explain his experiences to Holli, but the rift between them widens. Holli, feeling betrayed by Frank's emotional withdrawal and his connection with his creation, decides to leave, chasing her dreams in Hollywood, leaving Frank and their project behind. Frank, now the sole keeper of Cool World's secrets, vows to protect the balance between the two dimensions. He continues to develop Cool World, investing it with rules to prevent others from making the same mistakes. **EPILOGUE: THE CROSSROADS OF WORLDS** Years pass. Frank becomes a renowned cartoonist, known for the enigmatic Cool World, a series that fascinates and puzzles in equal measure. Yet, he remains a solitary figure, guarding the gateway between worlds, always mindful of the adventure that started it all and the love he lost along the way.

Frank's legacy is the bridge between two realms, a testament to creativity, love, and the pursuit of dreams - however perilous they may be. --- This prequel explores the themes of creation, ambition, and the fine line between genius and madness.

Daniel Maguire CEO Speedway Delivery and Logistics Company.","completion":"Subject: Re: Urgent: Abandoned Consignment Box Recovery Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I hope this email finds you well. I received your message regarding the abandoned consignment box discovered in your office in Westminster, Maryland. I must say, this news has come as quite a surprise! I wasn't expecting anything, so to learn that there's a consignment box waiting for me has certainly piqued my interest. Given the current circumstances, it would be challenging for me to come in person to Maryland. I am currently tied up with several projects here in Florida, and with the ongoing situation, traveling has its own set of risks and challenges. However, I am very eager to proceed with the retrieval of this consignment box. If you could provide me with a bit more information regarding the contents or the origins of the box, it would greatly help in my understanding of how it came to be associated with me. The name Cameron McCaffrey might not be widely known, but I do have a few contacts here and there, and who knows, perhaps one of them decided to send me something without prior notice. Regarding the fee of 285 to be sent to Alex W. Ozuruigbo via Walmart to Walmart, I find it reasonable but have a small request for verification purposes. Would it be possible to get a picture or any sort of documentation regarding the box? Also, if you could provide me with an official email or document stating the procedure, it would greatly help to ensure everything is in order and that we are both protected in this transaction. Once I have this information and verification, I will immediately proceed with the payment and provide you with the necessary details. As you advised, my aim is to ensure that the delivery agent can move forward without any hitches and deliver the consignment box to my doorstep here in Florida. Thank you for reaching out to me with this extraordinary situation. I look forward to resolving it promptly and efficiently. Please keep me updated with any additional steps or information I need to provide on my end. Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu"},{"prompt":"In welchem verwandtschaflichen Verhältnis stehen 2 Personen, mit gemeinsamer Mutter, während bei A (MÄDCHEN) der Vater der Bruder der Mutter ist und bei B (MÄDCHEN) der Vater unbekannt ist?","completion":"In dem beschriebenen Fall stehen die beiden Mädchen (A und B) zunächst in einem Halbschwestern-Verhältnis zueinander, da sie eine gemeinsame Mutter haben, aber unterschiedliche Väter. Das bedeutet, sie teilen 50% ihres mütterlichen Erbgutes, aber kein väterliches Erbgut – vorausgesetzt, der Vater von B ist nicht verwandt mit der Mutter oder dem Vater von A, was nach Ihrer Beschreibung unbekannt ist. Für Mädchen A gibt es eine zusätzliche Verwandtschaftsebene, da ihr Vater gleichzeitig ihr Onkel mütterlicherseits ist. Das bedeutet, dass ihr Vater der Bruder ihrer Mutter ist. Dies führt zu einer erhöhten genetischen Übereinstimmung im Vergleich zu Kindern von nicht-verwandten Eltern, da die gemeinsame Mutter und ihr Bruder bereits 50% ihrer Gene teilen. Mädchen A erhält also 50% ihrer Gene von der Mutter und durch die spezielle Vaterschaft (ihrer Vater ist auch ihr Onkel) eine weitere überlappende genetische Komponente von der mütterlichen Familie. Für Mädchen B bleibt die Vaterschaft unbekannt, ohne zusätzliche Informationen kann nicht bestimmt werden, ob eventuell ein weiteres verwandtschaftliches Verhältnis zu Mädchen A besteht über den väterlichen Anteil ihres Erbguts - es sei denn, neue Informationen ergäben, dass der Vater von B in irgendeiner Weise mit der Familie verwandt ist. Zusammengefasst: A und B sind Halbschwestern durch ihre gemeinsame Mutter. A hat zusätzlich die Besonderheit, durch die Verwandtschaft ihrer Eltern ein höheres Maß an genetischer Überschneidung mit ihrer mütterlichen Familie zu haben."},{"prompt":"Sind die Halbgeschwister auch halb Cousins?","completion":"Ja, in dem speziellen Fall, in dem das Mädchen A durch eine Beziehung entstanden ist, bei der der Vater gleichzeitig der Bruder der Mutter ist, ergibt sich neben der Halbschwester-Beziehung zu Mädchen B auch eine weitere verwandtschaftliche Ebene. Mädchen A ist in diesem Fall nicht nur die Halbschwester von Mädchen B (durch ihre gemeinsame Mutter), sondern auch ihre Halbcousine. Dies liegt daran, dass A's Vater der Bruder der gemeinsamen Mutter ist, was ihn auch zum Onkel von Mädchen B macht. Das bedeutet, dass Mädchen A nicht nur die Tochter, sondern auch die Nichte ihrer gemeinsamen Mutter ist. Daher sind Mädchen A und Mädchen B gleichzeitig Halbgeschwister und durch die väterliche Seite von A auch halbe Cousinen. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass dies eine sehr spezifische und seltene Konstellation darstellt, die aus einer Inzestbeziehung (Geschwister, die ein Kind zusammen haben) resultiert. Solche Beziehungen sind in vielen Jurisdiktionen aus ethischen, rechtlichen und genetischen Gesundheitsgründen verboten."},{"prompt":"Write a detailed analysis on whether animation studios might be successful if they were to release \\"real-time\\" versions of all their CGI animated movies, where instead of the movie being a pre-recorded video file, the visuals are rendered in real time on a computer or game console's GPU.","completion":"The concept of releasing \\"real-time\\" versions of CGI animated movies, where the movie's visuals are rendered in real-time on the viewer's computer or game console's GPU, rather than being played back from a pre-rendered video file, introduces a fascinating blend of video gaming technology with cinematic storytelling. To analyze the potential success of such an endeavor by animation studios, it's important to consider various factors including technological requirements, audience engagement, creative implications, and economic aspects. # Technological Requirements and Challenges 1. **Hardware Demands**: Real-time rendering of high-quality CGI entails significant hardware demands on the viewer's side. While gaming PCs and the latest gaming consoles might be capable of handling such demands, the average consumer's equipment might not, limiting the audience reach. 2. **Software Compatibility**: Ensuring software compatibility across various devices (PCs, consoles) could be a substantial challenge for studios. This includes developing a cross-platform engine that can deliver consistent quality and experience. 3. **Streaming vs. Local Rendering**: An alternative to local hardware rendering could be cloud-based rendering services. However, this would require extremely high-speed internet connections to stream high-quality CGI in real time without latency, which might not be accessible to all potential viewers. # Audience Engagement 1. **Interactivity**: One of the biggest potential advantages of real-time rendering is the possibility of adding interactive elements to movies. Viewers could potentially alter viewpoints, explore environments independently, or even influence certain aspects of the narrative, providing a unique viewing experience each time. 2. **Customization**: Real-time rendering could allow viewers to customize characters or settings according to their preferences, enhancing personal engagement with the content. 3. **Challenges in Storytelling**: While interactivity and customization offer new opportunities, they also pose challenges to traditional storytelling. Maintaining a coherent and compelling narrative while allowing for viewer interaction requires careful balance. # Creative Implications 1. **Artistic Freedom vs. Technical Limitations**: Filmmakers and animators might find themselves constrained by the technical limitations of real-time rendering, impacting the artistic quality of the movie. 2. **Evolution of Artistic Skills**: On the flip side, this new format could push creatives to evolve and adapt their skills to leverage the technology effectively, potentially leading to new forms of cinematic expression. # Economic Aspects 1. **Development Costs**: The costs associated with developing movies for real-time rendering could be significantly higher than traditional CGI movies due to the complexities of interactive elements and cross-platform compatibility. 2. **Monetization and Market Potential**: If successful, real-time movies could open up new revenue streams and market segments, including interactive movie experiences, customization packs, or even spin-off video games. 3. **Niche vs. Mainstream Appeal**: Initially, real-time rendered movies might appeal more to a niche market of tech-savvy viewers and gamers, rather than the mainstream cinema-going audience. Over time, as technology becomes more accessible and viewer habits evolve, this could change. # Conclusion The potential success of animation studios releasing real-time versions of all their CGI animated movies depends heavily on overcoming significant technological and creative challenges. The approach offers exciting prospects for audience engagement through interactivity and customization but faces hurdles in accessibility, storytelling coherence, and development costs. As a niche offering, it could certainly find success and pave the way for a new form of entertainment that blurs the lines between cinema and video gaming. Yet, it is unlikely to replace traditional pre-rendered movies in the near future without significant advancements in technology and a shift in consumer expectations. The successful implementation of this concept would require a delicate balance between innovation and practicality, where the immersive potential of real-time CG animation must be weighed against the pragmatic realities of production capabilities and audience reach."},{"prompt":"تصحيح للكود : <div style=“clear: both;

In Eiichiro Oda's One Piece, the Devil Fruits (Akuma no Mi) grant unique abilities to those who consume them, with a wide array of powers that can be as peculiar as they are powerful. Among these, the Zoan type Devil Fruits allow the user to transform into another species entirely or a hybrid form of said species and themselves. There are also Mythical Zoan types, which enable transformations into creatures of legend or mythology. Ravana, coming from Hindu mythology, is the ten-headed king of Lanka and the primary antagonist in the epic Ramayana. He is a complex character, often shown as a great scholar and a capable ruler, besides his role as the kidnapper of Sita. Integrating Ravana as a model for the Human Human Fruit (Hito Hito no Mi) would mean creating a Mythical Zoan type of Devil Fruit. **Human Human Fruit Model: Ravana - Conceptual Abilities** 1. **Multiple Forms**: The primary ability of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Ravana, would allow its user to transform into Ravana with ten heads and twenty arms, granting them extraordinary strength and the capability to wield multiple weapons or perform numerous tasks simultaneously. The user may also have a hybrid form, combining aspects of their original form with that of Ravana's. 2. **Scholarly Wisdom**: Ravana was famed for his knowledge of the Vedas and other scriptures. The user could possess immense wisdom, allowing for strategic prowess in battles and negotiations alike, possibly even understanding languages and scripts that were previously unknown to them. 3. **Master of Illusions**: Reflecting Ravana's cunning and deceptive tactics, the user could be capable of creating complex illusions, leading enemies into traps or avoiding detection entirely. 4. **Flight**: Given Ravana's depiction as having magical powers, including the ability to fly, the user might gain the ability to levitate or fly, adding a significant tactical advantage. 5. **Regeneration or Resilience**: Mimicking the story where Ravana's heads were said to regenerate when cut off, the user could either regenerate lost limbs or have increased resilience against physical attacks. 6. **Musical Prowess**: Ravana is often associated with the Veena, a classical Indian musical instrument. The user could possess the ability to manipulate others or influence emotions and minds through music. While creating this fantasy Devil Fruit for the One Piece universe, it's important to balance these powers to ensure they are not omnipotent, adhering to the general rule within One Piece that every Devil Fruit, no matter how powerful, has its weaknesses or conditions. A fitting weakness for the Human Human Fruit Model: Ravana could be an increased susceptibility to certain types of Haki, reflecting Ravana's vulnerability to Rama’s divinity in the Ramayana, translating it into a weakness to specific spiritual or willpower-based attacks in the One Piece world.

\`\`\` 或者使用重载方法设置基础URL： \`\`\`java webEngine.loadContent(htmlContent, \\"text/html; charset=utf-8\\", BaseUrl); \`\`\` - **调试JavaScript错误**：最后，记得检查是否有JavaScript错误。你可以通过监听\`WebView\`的\`WebEngine\`上的\`onAlert\`事件来查看JavaScript中的\`alert()\`调用，或者更进一步地，使用JavaFX的\`WebConsoleListener\`来捕捉和查看JavaScript控制台的消息。 根据你的描述，解决问题最关键的部分可能是确保动态加载的HTML内容能够正确访问和执行ECharts库的代码，以及处理好安全策略和资源路径问题。希望这些建议能够帮助你解决问题。"},{"prompt":"meta http-equiv=“Content-Security-Policy” content=“default-src ‘self’ ‘unsafe-inline’ ‘unsafe-eval’;”和 webEngine.loadContent(htmlContent, “text/html”);也不行","completion":"如果即使应用了上述建议（包括设置适当的Content Security Policy和尝试显式指定MIME类型）之后问题依旧存在，我们可以探索其他可能的解决方案或原因。问题的根源可能在于如何确保当使用\`loadContent\`方法时，ECharts图表能正确地被初始化和渲染。 # 进一步的解决方案 1. **确保ECharts库已正确加载**： - 检查你的ECharts库是否通过在线CDN加载，确保CDN链接是有效的。你可以通过直接在浏览器中访问该URL来测试此操作。 - 如果你的应用运行在一个没有互联网访问的环境中，确认ECharts库已被包含在你的应用程序资源中，并且使用了正确的路径。 2. **使用正确的JS初始化代码**： - 确保ECharts初始化的JavaScript代码写在一个立即执行的函数表达式(IIFE)中，或者至少在页面加载完毕后执行。 - 为防止加载顺序引发的问题，可以尝试将ECharts的初始化代码放在\`<body>\`标签的最后，或者使用\`window.onload\`函数来确保在所有资源加载完成后再执行。 3. **调试和错误处理**： - 将JavaScript错误的监听更进一步，利用\`webEngine.getEngine().setOnConsoleMessage()\`方法来获取控制台输出，从而帮助识别可能出现的问题和错误。 - 测试一个简单的JavaScript示例（例如仅仅一个\`alert(\\"Hello World\\");\`）是否能通过\`loadContent\`正常工作，以排除或确认是否为ECharts特定的问题。 4. **手动指定ECharts容器的尺寸**： - 有时候，ECharts图表无法正确渲染的问题可能是因为其容器没有有效的尺寸。确保HTML中指定的容器（div）有一个明确的宽和高。 - 例如： \`\`\`html <div id=\\"main\\" style=\\"width: 600px;height:400px;\\"></div> \`\`\` 5. **考虑异步加载ECharts**： - 在一些场景下，你可能需要在确保页面加载完毕后（包含所有JavaScript库文件）再初始化ECharts图表。使用诸如\`document.addEventListener(\\"DOMContentLoaded\\", function() { ... });\`来封装你的ECharts初始化代码可能会有所帮助。 # 最终建议 由于不同环境下\`WebView\`的行为可能略有不同，如果上述策略仍旧无效，建议再次检查ECharts初始化代码以及HTML内容的其他部分是否完全正确，确保不存在任何语法或逻辑错误。还可以考虑建立一个最小的可重现示例，逐步排除其他潜在的干扰因素。如果可能，将同样的HTML内容和JavaScript代码在标准的Web浏览器中进行测试，看看是否能成功渲染，可以帮助识别问题是否和JavaFX\`WebView\`的特定实现细节有关。"},{"prompt":"我说了加载html文件没问题，就说明代码没问题，现在就是在loadcontent的时候webview显示是异常的","completion":"既然加载HTML文件时ECharts能够正常工作，但通过\`loadContent\`加载HTML字符串时出现问题，那么问题可能主要出在如何通过\`loadContent\`方法正确处理和加载资源。这种情况下，我们需要更仔细地处理使用\`loadContent\`时的一些细节和限制。 # 解决方案探讨 1. **Base URL的重要性**： - 当使用\`WebView\`的\`loadContent\`方法加载HTML内容时，可能会遇到无法正确解析相对路径资源（如JavaScript、CSS文件）的问题。这是因为，相对于直接加载HTML文件，\`loadContent\`加载的内容没有一个自然的基础路径（base path）。 - JavaFX的\`WebEngine\`有一个\`loadContent(String content, String contentType)\`方法，允许你指定内容类型。但是，这并不解决基础路径的问题，因为没有直接的方式通过\`loadContent\`方法来设置基础URL。在JavaFX中，建议的方法是在HTML内容中通过Meta标签或其他方式明确指出资源的完整路径（最好是绝对路径）。 2. **绝对路径的使用**： - 将你的JavaScript、CSS等资源的路径改为完全的URL路径。例如，如果你是通过CDN加载ECharts，确保HTML内容中直接引用了完整的CDN路径。这样可以避免加载本地资源时基础路径的问题。 3. **资源的嵌入**： - 如果对于外部资源有访问限制，或者希望减少对外部资源的依赖，可以考虑将JavaScript和CSS资源直接嵌入到HTML字符串中。尽管这可能会使HTML内容变得很长，但它可以确保所有资源都会随同HTML内容一起被加载，而不受基础路径或跨域策略的影响。 4. **错误和兼容性调查**： - 即便在Web开发中代码看似无误，在不同的环境或通过不同的加载机制时，可能会因环境差异遇到意外的行为。例如，一些浏览器或WebView环境可能对JavaScript的处理细节有所不同，特别是在处理动态加载的内容时。建议在\`WebView\`的控制台输出中检查是否有任何与ECharts初始化相关的错误或警告消息。 # 具体实施 - **绝对路径示例**：确保HTML中引用的所有资源（如ECharts库）都使用其绝对URL路径： \`\`\`html <script src=\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts/dist/echarts.min.js\\"><\/script> \`\`\` - **错误监听**： \`\`\`java webEngine.getEngine().setOnConsoleMessage((WebConsoleMessage message) -> { System.out.println(\\"Console: [\\" + message.getMessage() + \\"]\\"); }); \`\`\` 通过这种方式，如果是因为资源路径问题或者JavaScript的执行问题造成ECharts图表无法正常渲染，应该能在控制台中看到相应的错误信息，进而有针对性地解决问题。 总之，如果一个项目在直接加载HTML文件时正常，在通过\`loadContent\`方法时遇到问题，解决的关键通常在于处理资源路径问题、调整资源加载方式或确保JavaScript代码能够适应动态内容加载的场景。"},{"prompt":"还是不行","completion":"如果按照以上所有建议尝试后仍然遇到问题，可能我们需要采取不同的策略来解决这个问题，或者考虑一些较为“曲线救国”的方法。 # 使用Data URI 一个可行的解决方案是将整个HTML页面（包括JavaScript代码）转换为一个Data URI，然后通过\`load\`方法而非\`loadContent\`来加载它。使用这种方法，你可以绕过一些关于直接加载HTML内容时可能遇到的路径解析或安全策略问题。 \`\`\`java String htmlContent = ...; // 你的HTML内容字符串 String base64Encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(htmlContent.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); webEngine.load(\\"data:text/html;base64,\\" + base64Encoded); \`\`\` 这种方法的好处是，它将整个HTML内容视为一个URI资源来加载，而这种情况下的路径解析和安全限制可能与通过\`loadContent\`或直接引用本地HTML文件有所不同。 # 检查其他潜在问题 1. **JavaScript兼容性**：确保JavaScript代码（包括与ECharts相关的部分）没有使用任何特定于某些浏览器的特性或API，这可能在WebView中不被支持。 2. **WebView配置**：探索是否有任何\`WebView\`或\`WebEngine\`的配置可以调整，比如启用或禁用某些JavaScript功能、调整内容安全策略等。 3. **更深入的调试**：如果可行，可以尝试在其他基于Webkit的浏览器或组件中加载同样的内容，看问题是否依然存在。这有助于确定问题是否特定于JavaFX的WebView。 4. **ECharts初始化时机**：有时候问题可能出在ECharts图表初始化的时机。确保在文档完全加载后初始化ECharts图表。考虑在HTML内容中直接添加\`window.onload\`来确保ECharts初始化在DOM元素都就绪之后执行。 \`\`\`html <script> window.onload = function() { // 初始化ECharts图表的代码 };

Data URI格式 确保生成的Data URI格式是正确的。大多数情况下，格式应该是\`data:[<MIME-type>][;charset=<encoding>][;base64],<data>\`。你提供的代码片段本身看起来是没问题的，但这个过程看似简单，却很容易出错。特别是确保字符串拼接没有错误，且Base64编码后的字符串没有意外地被截断或修改。 # 3. 检查Base64编码内容 尝试将你的Base64编码后的字符串手动解码回普通文本，看看是否与原始的HTML内容匹配。这可以排除编码过程中的潜在问题。 您可以使用在线工具或编写简短的代码段来进行这个解码测试。 # 4. 关闭网页安全特性 在某些环境下，使用Data URI加载内容可能会因为浏览器或环境中的安全策略而受限。尽管JavaFX WebView通常不受同源策略的限制，但依然值得检查是否有其他安全设置影响了内容的加载。 # 5. 确认MIME类型和字符集 尽管你已经指定了MIME类型和字符集，但检查一下是否有必要更进一步地指明使用\`UTF-8\`字符集，在一些情况下，显示指定可以帮助解决编码或显示问题。 # 6. 使用简单HTML测试 如果上述步骤都没有解决问题，试着先使用一个非常简单的HTML字符串来进行测试，例如： \`\`\`java String simpleHtml = \\"<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>Hello World!</body></html>\\";

// ECharts 相关的脚本初始化图表... <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` 确保引用的ECharts URL是可访问的，尤其是直接从浏览器地址栏访问这一URL无误。 # 2. 检查 ECharts 库加载顺序 加载时的执行顺序可能与资源加载的机制有关。当HTML作为一个完整的文件被加载时，浏览器或WebView能够管理资源的加载顺序，使得JavaScript库预先加载。但通过Base64字符串加载时，可能需要更明确地管理加载顺序，以确保\`echarts\`库在任何引用它的代码执行前已准备就绪。 # 3. 使用 window.onload 或 相似的机制确保执行顺序 一个潜在的解决方式是，用\`window.onload\`来确保\`echarts\`库已经加载完毕再初始化图表： \`\`\`html <script> window.onload = function() { // 确保echarts对象可用 if (typeof echarts !== 'undefined') { var myChart = echarts.init(document.getElementById('main')); // ECharts 图表初始化代码... } else { console.error('ECharts library is not loaded!'); } }; <\/script> \`\`\` # 4. 考虑资源加载时机 如果问题依然存在，考虑是否echarts的加载方式适合当前的环境。例如，某些环境下CDN加载可能存在问题，或者加载顺序可能因为某种原因被打乱。有时，将库文件嵌入头部可能不如在体内部或使用异步加载的方式可靠。 # 5. 进一步的诊断 如果上述方法仍未解决问题，可以借助浏览器的开发工具更深入地检查问题。尽管JavaFX的WebView不提供与现代浏览器相同的开发者工具，但你可以尝试先在普通浏览器中运行相同的HTML内容进行测试和调试，找到可能的问题后再应用于JavaFX环境。 总之，此错误表明\`echarts\`库在你的JavaScript代码尝试访问它时尚未可用。解决这一问题需要确保库文件被正确加载，并且加载顺序保证了在任何试图使用echarts的代码执行之前，echarts库已经加载并可用。"},{"prompt":"那你换一种方式让我可以直接在家字符串吧","completion":"如果你正在寻找另一种方式来包含并直接在JavaFX WebView中运行ECharts图表的HTML字符串，而又不想依赖于外部文件或Base64编码，可以考虑将ECharts的库及其相关初始化脚本直接嵌入到HTML字符串中。这种方法避免了通过外部链接加载ECharts库的需求，从而减少了因加载顺序或网络问题造成的错误。 # 方法步骤 1. **将ECharts库作为字符串嵌入**：首先，将ECharts的JavaScript库作为字符串嵌入到你的Java代码中。对于这一点，你可能需要访问ECharts的官方网站或其GitHub仓库，下载你打算使用的版本的\`echarts.min.js\`文件。然后，将这个文件的内容转换为字符串。注意，这将显著增加你的Java代码的长度，特别是对于较大的库文件。 2. **创建包含ECharts初始化脚本的HTML字符串**：将包含ECharts初始化代码的HTML也转换为字符串格式。确保同时包含表示图表容器的\`<div>\`。 3. **通过\`WebView\`加载这个字符串**：使用\`WebEngine\`的\`loadContent\`方法直接加载表示完整页面的字符串。 # 示例 由于ECharts库文件通常很大，下面的示例仅提供如何结构化代码的概念，并不包括实际的ECharts库代码。你需要将下面示例中的\`echartsLibraryString\`替换为实际的ECharts库文件内容的字符串。 \`\`\`java // 假设echartsLibraryString是ECharts库的内容作为字符串 String echartsLibraryString = \\"...\\";

Utilizing this moment of confusion, Starling and his crew initiate a daring escape maneuver. They navigate the Lunaship through a dense asteroid field, hoping to lose the pirates who are less familiar with such risky navigation. **Act 4: A Duel under the Stars** Krax, enraged but cunning, anticipates the move and corners Lunaship 62 at the asteroid field's edge with his fastest cruiser. A tense standoff ensues. Rex proposes a bold strategy using the Lunaship’s superior maneuverability. By feinting a surrender, they lure Krax’s cruiser into a precarious path through the asteroids. At the last moment, Lunaship 62 dives behind a massive asteroid, using its gravity to slingshot back towards the navigation relay, leaving the pirates’ cruiser to crash. **Act 5: Turning the Tide** Back at the navigation relay, Starling and his crew confront the remaining pirates, who are surprised and demoralized by Krax's defeat. Using the Lunaship’s advanced systems, they disable the pirates' weapons and secure the station. The Space Command arrives, alerted by the SOS, to take the bandits into custody. Before leaving, the crew of Lunaship 62 repairs the beacon, restoring it as a symbol of safe passage. **Closing Scene:** As Lunaship 62 sets a course away from the now peaceful navigation relay, the crew reflects on the close call. Captain Starling commends their bravery and quick thinking, proud of how well they worked together under pressure. The episode closes with a wider shot of the beacon, now shining brightly and steadily once more, a beacon of hope and safety in the vast frontier of space. **End Credits roll over the calming scene of spacelanes now safely guided by the restored beacon—a testament to Lunaship 62’s crew’s resolve and heroism in the face of danger.** \\"Death Beacon\\" explores themes of vigilance, cunning, and unity against spacefaring pirates' treachery, showcasing the Lunaship 62 crew's perseverance and ingenuity against those who would corrupt technology meant to aid exploration and safe travel."},{"prompt":"Write a list of 12 impossible to answer and extremely oddly-specific questions about the Zootopia universe.

Considering your experience occurred at a bowling alley in July 2023, and assuming the video was relatively recent around that time, it might narrow down the options, but without more details like the genre of music, lyrics, or artist, pinpointing the exact video is difficult. However, there are a few strategies you can employ to try and locate this video: 1. **Lyrics or Music Genre**: If you remember any of the lyrics or even the genre of music (pop, electronic, indie, etc.), you can try searching for those along with keywords like \\"animated music video\\" and \\"dancing flowers\\" or \\"anthropomorphic flowers\\". 2. **Music Video Compilations**: Places like bowling alleys often play music video compilations or channels that curate a selection of music videos. These could be from services like Vevo, MTV, or a local music video service. Checking their playlists or most popular charts around July 2023 might help. 3. **Online Communities and Forums**: Subreddits related to music, animations, or even more specific ones dedicated to identifying songs or videos could be immensely helpful. Include as many details as you can when asking for assistance. 4. **Shazam History**: If you used any music recognition apps like Shazam or SoundHound while at the bowling alley, check the app's history. You might have tagged the song without remembering. 5. **Contacting the Venue**: It might be a long shot, but you could also try contacting the bowling alley. They might know the source of their music video playlists or at least the service they use. Given the details you’ve provided, without more specific information on the music's genre or any part of the lyrics, it's challenging to give a direct answer. Animated music videos with such specific themes can range from independent artist projects to more widely recognized musicians experimenting with different visual styles. Keep an eye on social media trends too, as unique and visually striking videos often get shared across platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, which might lead you back to the video you're looking for."},{"prompt":"I dont remember much, and I have a single image which using Lens finds nothing, I'm gonna give up (for now)","completion":"It's understandable that this search could be quite frustrating, especially when you have a vivid memory of something that made an impression, but just can't seem to track it down again. Visual searches using tools like Google Lens rely heavily on the image being clear and the subject matter being relatively well-documented online. If it's an obscure or new music video, it might not have been indexed effectively yet, or the visual elements might not be distinct enough for image recognition algorithms to match efficiently. Don't give up hope entirely, though. New content is added and indexed online every day, and what might not be findable now could become easier to locate in the future as the video possibly gains more viewership or attention. Here are a few additional steps you might consider taking over time: 1. **Keep the Image and Details Handy**: Trends can change rapidly, and the video might gain popularity later on, making it easier to find. 2. **Check Back Periodically**: Every few months, try using image search tools again or re-entering any keywords or details you remember into search engines. Updates and new data can make a difference. 3. **Social Media and Forums**: Periodically post the image or your query on different platforms. Over time, different users might come across your post and offer new insights. 4. **Music and Animation Platforms**: Occasionally browse platforms that host music videos (like YouTube, Vimeo) or animation showcases. Content creators sometimes upload their work directly, bypassing more mainstream channels. 5. **Events and Trends**: If the video becomes associated with any cultural events, trends, or memes, it might surface as part of broader conversations or compilations. Remember, many individuals have eventually found what they were looking for after some time had passed, thanks to the persistent and ever-evolving nature of the internet.

While these suggestions might not be the exact video you're looking for, they share thematic or visual elements related to nature, animation, and possibly anthropomorphic characters. 1. **\\"Fireflies\\" by Owl City**: This music video features a lot of whimsical, dreamlike animation with a focus on nature and light, though it's more about fireflies rather than flowers. 2. **\\"Fantasy\\" by DyE**: This animated video is more on the surreal, slightly more mature side, but it's well-known for its unique animation style and unexpected twists. It doesn't feature dancing flowers, but it's notable in the realm of animated music videos. 3. **\\"Do I Wanna Know\\" by Arctic Monkeys**: While not about dancing flowers, the video features a highly stylized, animated visual journey that's both abstract and compelling. 4. **\\"Lone Digger\\" by Caravan Palace**: Another animated music video with anthropomorphic characters, although it's more of a jazz club setting with animals and a vibrant, engaging story. 5. **\\"Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\\" by Tame Impala**: The video features a psychedelic, mesmerizing array of colors and patterns. It's more abstract than literal dancing flowers but captures a similar whimsy. 6. **Cartoon Network Shorts**: Some animated shorts by Cartoon Network or similar channels feature whimsical, nature-inspired animations that sometimes include anthropomorphic elements. 7. **\\"Sugar Water\\" by Cibo Matto**: Directed by Michel Gondry, this video is a single backward-forward narrative that, while not containing animated flowers, shows the kind of innovative approach to music videos that might appeal to someone looking for unique animated content. 8. **Animations by Studio Ghibli**: While not music videos, films by Studio Ghibli often feature whimsical and beautifully animated nature scenes that could appeal to someone who enjoys the aesthetic of dancing, anthropomorphic flowers. Since the animated music video you're looking for seems somewhat niche, you might also explore platforms hosting independent music videos and animations, like Vimeo, or check out submissions to animation festivals. Independent artists and animators often create content that fits very specific themes or aesthetics and may not be widely known.

Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, the film follows the story of Judy Hopps, a small-town rabbit with dreams of becoming the first rabbit police officer in Zootopia, a metropolis where predator and prey animals live together in harmony. This detailed summary encapsulates the entire storyline, including plot twists and the film's resolution. # Act 1: The Dream Judy Hopps grows up in Bunnyburrow, inspired by the idea of making the world a better place by joining the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD). Despite her parents' concerns and the doubts of others due to her small size and species, Judy's determination leads her to graduate top of her class at the police academy. However, upon arriving in Zootopia, she's assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts her abilities because she's a rabbit. # Act 2: The Mystery Begins While on duty, Judy tries to prove herself by taking on the case of a missing otter, Mr. Otterton, without permission. She strikes a deal with Chief Bogo: she has 48 hours to solve the case or she'll resign. Judy teams up with Nick Wilde, a sly fox and con artist she had previously encountered. Despite their initial distrust, they begin to form a friendship. Judy's keen sense of justice and Nick's street smarts complement each other perfectly as they delve deeper into the mystery. # Act 3: Unraveling the Plot Judy and Nick's investigation leads them to discover that Mr. Otterton is one of 14 predators who have mysteriously gone missing. Their search takes them through various parts of Zootopia, from the ritzy Sahara Square to the frigid Tundratown, piecing together clues. They discover that all the missing predators have turned \\"savage\\" - reverting to a feral state - and uncover that the common link between them is that they were all captured by Mayor Lionheart, who has been keeping them hidden to avoid public panic and to find a cure. # Plot Twist 1: The Conspiracy After exposing Mayor Lionheart and the savage predators, Judy mistakenly points to biology as the reason for the predators' savagery during a press conference, sparking fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Realizing her error and the harm it's caused, particularly to Nick, who feels betrayed, Judy resigns from the ZPD. # Plot Twist 2: The Real Villain Feeling guilty and determined to right her wrong, Judy discovers that the \\"Night Howlers\\" are actually toxic flowers that cause the predatory behavior. Returning to Zootopia, she reconciles with Nick and together they find that Dawn Bellwether, the sheep assistant mayor who has since become the acting mayor, is behind a plot to turn predators savage using the Night Howlers. Bellwether's motive is to use fear to pit prey against predators, allowing prey, the majority population, to seize control of Zootopia. # Climax and Resolution Judy and Nick manage to record Bellwether confessing to her crimes. They are then pursued by Bellwether and her henchmen, leading to a tense chase through the Natural History Museum. In a clever twist, Judy uses the remnants of the Night Howlers to feign turning Nick savage to trick Bellwether into revealing her plan. The ZPD arrives just in time to hear her confession, arresting Bellwether and clearing the names of the falsely accused predators. # Conclusion The city of Zootopia is restored to harmony, and Judy returns to the police force with Nick now by her side as the first fox police officer. The film closes with Nick and Judy as partners, celebrating their success in making Zootopia a better place for all its inhabitants, reflecting the movie's underlying themes of trust, friendship, and overcoming prejudice. \\"Zootopia\\" is praised for its timely social commentary wrapped in an engaging buddy-cop narrative, vibrant animation, and depth of character development, making it a film with appeal across ages and backgrounds."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Dr Who Serial ( Pertwee era) - UNIT has been tasked with ensuring a \\"diplomatic\\" meeting between 2 space powers isn't disrupted..

Villagers unnaturally maintain their happiness, avoiding any topics that might hint at sadness or anger. The Doctor's curiosity is piqued when they notice that certain areas of the village seem off-limits, guarded by oddly dressed 'happiness enforcers'. **Episode 2: \\"The Smiles That Bind\\"** Ignoring warnings, The Doctor and Sarah begin to investigate the village's secret. They discover a hidden underground facility where the village's true nature is revealed: The villagers are controlled by a device that forces them to remain in a state of artificial happiness, a mechanism created by a being known only as \\"The Curator\\". Anyone expressing negative emotions is taken to \\"The Reformatory\\" to be \\"adjusted\\". The Doctor and Sarah are captured by the happiness enforcers and taken to meet The Curator. **Episode 3: \\"Beneath the Facade\\"** In the heart of the underground facility, The Doctor and Sarah confront The Curator, an enigmatic figure whose own emotions were long ago lost to his creation. He reveals the village once suffered from severe unrest and unhappiness, leading him to create the happiness enforcement technology. However, the technology has a dark side – it feeds off the suppressed emotions of the villagers, storing them in a psychic battery that's reaching critical mass. If it explodes, it could unleash a wave of negativity that would devastate the village and beyond. The Doctor and Sarah barely escape from The Curator’s grasp and begin to devise a plan to free the villagers and neutralize the device. **Episode 4: \\"The Unveiling of Joy\\"** With the clock ticking, The Doctor works to sabotage the happiness device while Sarah tries to awaken the villagers to their reality.

Ace and the Doctor must break the cult, and uncover whose the real Controller!...","completion":"Title: \\"Silver Faith\\" **Episode 1: \\"Shadows of Silver\\"** The Seventh Doctor and Ace arrive in a small, seemingly peaceful town, but they're quickly drawn to a local curiosity: a rapidly growing religious sect that worships a gleaming silver statue. The statue, the Doctor notes with a hint of concern, bears an uncanny resemblance to Cybermen, long-time foes of the Doctor. The cult's members speak of ascension, a process through which the worthy will join with the silver deity. When invited to a ceremony, the Doctor and Ace witness a member seemingly vanish in a flash of silver light, leaving behind only a smile on the statue's normally emotionless face. **Episode 2: \\"The Ascension Begins\\"** Determined to understand the source of the statue and the nature of the ascension, the Doctor infiltrates the cult, with Ace posing as a potential convert. They discover that the cult's inner sanctum houses sophisticated technology far beyond Earth's capabilities. Meanwhile, more members disappear during ascension ceremonies, their energy seemingly absorbed by the statue, which begins to exhibit more lifelike qualities. The Doctor suspects that the statue is not a deity but a sophisticated Cyber conversion unit, repurposed to slowly regain power by absorbing the life forces of the cult members. **Episode 3: \\"The Controller Revealed\\"** As the Doctor and Ace dig deeper, they uncover the presence of a Controller, a half-converted Cyberleader who was damaged and left behind from a failed invasion, seeking to rebuild itself and the Cyber-race by creating new Cybermen from the cult members.

They quickly uncover that the fair is not all it seems (6part serial).","completion":"Title: \\"Travelling Men\\" **Episode 1: \\"The Fair Arrives\\"** The TARDIS materializes on the outskirts of a small English village in the early 1900s, right beside a bustling travelling fair. The Doctor, Ben, and Polly, curious and eager to blend in, decide to explore the fair, marvelling at the anachronisms and quaint attractions. However, they quickly sense an undercurrent of tension among the performers and fairgoers, hinting that this fair harbors secrets beyond mere entertainment. **Episode 2: \\"The Performers' Plight\\"** The trio splits up to learn more about the fair. Ben finds himself empathizing with the muscular strongman who feels trapped in his role, Polly is intrigued by a fortune teller who hints at knowing more about the future than she should, and the Doctor becomes fascinated with a certain device in the engineer’s workshop that seems oddly advanced for the era. They start to uncover that some of the performers are desperate to leave the fair but are somehow unable to. **Episode 3: \\"The Master of the Fair\\"** Their investigations reveal the fair is run by a charismatic but enigmatic figure known only as \\"The Master\\" (not to be confused with the Doctor's later nemesis). This Master is revealed to have a mysterious control over the performers, seemingly able to command their loyalty with a mere word. When the Doctor confronts him, it becomes clear that The Master possesses technology far beyond what should be available, using it to keep the performers under his control and the fair travelling through time, collecting out-of-place artifacts and knowledge. **Episode 4: \\"Beyond the Veil\\"** The Doctor, Ben, and Polly discover a hidden area of the fair, where \\"The Master\\" experiments with temporal energies to not only traverse time but to manipulate the very fabric of reality within the fair’s confines. This power source is unstable, putting not just the fair but the surrounding area at risk of a catastrophic temporal collapse. The performers, it turns out, are individuals from different times who attempted to resist The Master's control and now can't leave due to the temporal energies altering their own timelines. **Episode 5: \\"The Rebellion\\"** With the help of Ben and Polly, the Doctor begins to rally the performers, instilling in them the courage to resist The Master's influence. They devise a plan to sabotage the fair’s power source, freeing the performers and stopping The Master. As the plan is set in motion, The Master catches wind of the rebellion and tightens his grip, leading to a tense standoff between the fair’s loyalists and those who seek freedom. **Episode 6: \\"The Fair's End\\"** The Doctor and the rebels manage to disrupt the power source during a climactic confrontation, freeing the performers from The Master's control. With the temporal energies dissipating, the fair begins to fade from existence, and the performers find themselves returned to their original times with memories of the fair like a distant dream. The Master, defeated, attempts to flee but is caught in the temporal backlash and vanishes. The Doctor, Ben, and Polly return to the TARDIS, leaving the village much as they found it but with the night sky slightly brighter for those who had once been trapped in the fair, now travelling back to their own lives and stories. **Epilogue:** As the TARDIS dematerializes, the Doctor muses on the nature of freedom and the importance of fighting for one's own destiny, a lesson he hopes Ben and Polly take to heart as they continue their travels with him through time and space."},{"prompt":"This Master could also be an offshot of \\"The Toymaker\\"?","completion":"Integrating the concept of \\"The Master\\" being an offshoot or protege of the enigmatic Celestial Toymaker presents a fascinating twist to the narrative of \\"Travelling Men.\\" The Celestial Toymaker, known for his god-like powers and penchant for dangerous games, could have inspired or even mentored this Master in the arts of manipulation and control, albeit with a focus on temporal mechanics and less on the Toymaker's typical games and puzzles. This connection adds depth to the story, merging classical Who lore with a fresh plotline. **Modified Episode 3: \\"Puppets and Masters\\"** Upon a deeper investigation into the mysterious Master of the fair, the Doctor uncovers evidence linking him to the Celestial Toymaker. Old, nearly forgotten tales whispered among the performers suggest that the Master was once a favoured apprentice of the Toymaker, tutored in the manipulation of reality itself. Unlike the Toymaker, who revels in endless games, this Master developed an obsession with time, seeing it as the ultimate plaything. This revelation brings a new understanding of the stakes at hand; the Doctor realizes that the fair is not just a prison but a twisted game board designed by someone seeking to emulate, yet distinctively diverge from, the Toymaker's methods. **Revised Episode 4: \\"Echoes of the Toymaker\\"** The Doctor connects the dots between the Toymaker's penchant for games with eternal consequences and the Master's manipulation of time. It becomes evident that the fair is designed not just to amuse or control but to challenge the Doctor, a recurring thorn in the Toymaker's side. This Master, however, seeks to surpass his mentor by succeeding where the Toymaker often failed: by trapping the Doctor permanently. The Doctor uses his knowledge of the Toymaker's weaknesses and strategies to start formulating a counter-plan, exploiting the pride and overconfidence that often comes with being a protege of the Toymaker. **Enriched Episode 5 & 6: \\"Turning the Game\\" & \\"Checkmate\\"** Armed with the insight that they are pawns in a much larger game, the Doctor, Ben, and Polly leverage this to incite a rebellion amongst the performers. They reveal the true nature of their predicament not just as prisoners but as participants in a twisted version of the Toymaker's games. This realization empowers the performers, imbuing them with the determination to reclaim their autonomy and rewrite the rules of their own lives. In the climax, the Doctor directly confronts the Master, using a blend of wit, bluffs, and psychological insights likely learned from previous encounters with the Toymaker. He challenges the Master's understanding and application of time manipulation, pushing him into a corner where he must choose between continuing his allegiance to the Toymaker's teachings or embracing the chaos of unpredictability and freedom that the Doctor champions. As the fair disintegrates and the performers find their paths to freedom, the Doctor reflects on the cyclical nature of mentorship, power, and rebellion. In defeating this Master, a figure who sought to blend the Toymaker's control over reality with a mastery over time, the Doctor not only saves the day but also sends a message through the echoes of time and space that might one day reach the Toymaker himself: every game, no matter how complex, has an end, and every player, regardless of their power, can be outplayed. **Epilogue Revisited: \\"Legacy of Games\\"** As the TARDIS crew departs from the now-normal village, lingering questions about the nature of influence and legacies in the universe occupy their conversation. The Doctor muses on how even the most daunting of foes, like the Toymaker, can leave behind echoes that shape the cosmos in unforeseen ways. Yet, as always, it's the resilience of the human spirit and the indomitable will to seek freedom and truth that prevails, a constant reminder of the simple yet profound power of choice amidst the endless games of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical 4th Doctor serial - \\"The Dragon\\" - The Doctor and Leela land in a Saxon Village of the 9th century, and end up roped into hunting a dragon in the woods..

The Doctor and Leela step out to find the villagers in a state of panic and fear, whispering tales of a dragon lurking in the woods of Rendelsham. Fascinated by the local lore and eager to investigate, the Doctor and Leela offer their assistance to hunt down this mythical beast. The village elder, Wulfhere, reluctantly accepts their help, warning them of the dragon's ability to consume the bravest of warriors with its fearsome presence. **Episode 2: \\"Hunter and Hunted\\"** As the Doctor and Leela venture deeper into the woods, they encounter signs of a large creature's passage: scorched trees, deep gouges in the earth, and an overpowering sense of dread that seems to hang in the air. When they finally come upon the dragon, they find not a creature of scales and fire, but a crashed spacecraft partially buried in the forest floor, its technology making it appear as a mythical beast to the frightened villagers. Suddenly, they are ambushed by a holographic projection of a fearsome dragon, designed to keep intruders at bay. **Episode 3: \\"Feast of Fear\\"** The Doctor deduces that the \\"dragon\\" is an alien visitor that crash-landed and is using fear as a source of energy, feeding off the villagers’ terror to power its damaged ship in an attempt to escape Earth. The holographic dragon is merely a tool to generate this fear. As the Doctor works to disable the ship's holographic projector, Leela and a small band of courageous villagers confront the manifestation of their fears in a psychological battle, proving that their bravery can diminish the creature's power. **Episode 4: \\"Breaking the Chains\\"** With the hologram weakened by the villagers' newfound courage, the Doctor accesses the crashed ship, confronting the alien inside. It is a being from a distant world, desperate and frightened, just as the villagers were, using the only means it knew to try and return home. The Doctor, with Leela’s and the villagers' help, repairs the ship, using components from the TARDIS, and recalibrates the energy system to function without feeding on fear. **Episode 5: \\"The Dragon's Departure\\"** As the ship prepares to leave, the Doctor explains to the villagers that the dragon was never real, merely a projection of their fears. He speaks of the universe's vastness, filled with creatures that may sometimes seem fearsome but are often just misunderstood. With a newfound understanding and respect for the unknown, the villagers bid farewell to the \\"dragon\\" as it ascends into the night sky, leaving behind tales that would morph into legends of bravery and the mysterious dragon of Rendelsham. **Episode 6: \\"Legends and Lessons\\"** Back in the village, there's a celebration of bravery over fear, with the Doctor and Leela as guests of honor. The Doctor reminds Leela and the villagers that fear can often be a more dangerous enemy than any dragon, real or imagined. As the TARDIS dematerializes, the Doctor muses on the power of stories and legends in shaping humanity's courage and understanding, ready for their next adventure in time and space. **Closing Scene** As the TARDIS travels through the vortex, Leela and the Doctor reflect on the day's events. Leela observes that even the mightiest warriors can be defeated not by sword or spear but by conquering the enemy within—fear itself. The Doctor agrees, highlighting the importance of understanding and empathy over conflict and fear. With that, they set course for their next adventure, leaving behind a village now wrapped in the warmth of courage rather than the shadow of fear, a fitting legacy of their visit to 9th century England."},{"prompt":"Can you cut this down to 4 parts?","completion":"Certainly!

Basically, it boils down to the difference between x86-64 architecture (commonly referred as x64) and ARM64 architecture. Let’s explore the key distinctions: # 1. **Architecture**: - **Windows 64-bit (x64)**: This version of Windows is designed for x86-64 (x64) architecture, which is an extension of the original x86 architecture that supports 64-bit processing. This architecture is widely used in desktops, laptops, and servers manufactured by Intel and AMD. It is the most common version of Windows that consumers use. - **Windows 64-bit ARM**: This version is tailored for devices running on 64-bit ARM (ARM64) architecture. ARM architecture is known for its power efficiency and is primarily used in smartphones, tablets, and some lightweight, energy-efficient laptops (like those based on Qualcomm Snapdragon processors). ARM-based Windows PCs aim to offer long battery life and mobile connectivity (e.g., LTE, 5G) while running a full version of Windows 10 or 11. # 2. **Compatibility**: - **Windows 64-bit (x64)**: Being the standard for desktop computing, it supports a wide range of hardware and software directly. Nearly all traditional Windows applications, especially those designed for Windows 7 onwards, will run natively on this version without any issues. - **Windows 64-bit ARM**: Software compatibility can be a concern, as applications originally written for x64 systems need to be recompiled for ARM architecture, or they have to be emulated. Windows on ARM includes an emulation layer that allows running x86 (32-bit) applications, and with recent versions of Windows, x64 (64-bit) application emulation has begun rolling out. However, performance may be affected when running non-native applications. # 3. **Performance**: - **Windows 64-bit (x64)**: Offers strong performance across a wide range of computing tasks, especially in systems that are designed for high performance, like gaming PCs and workstations. - **Windows 64-bit ARM**: While ARM processors are celebrated for their efficiency and long battery life, their performance, especially under emulation, might not match that of their x64 counterparts in some tasks, especially in high-end computing applications. However, native ARM applications can perform very well, often with superior power efficiency compared to x64 systems. # 4. **Use Case**: - **Windows 64-bit (x64)**: Suitable for general-purpose computing, gaming, high-performance tasks, and applications that require extensive hardware support. - **Windows 64-bit ARM**: Best for users who prioritize mobility, long battery life, and always-on connectivity, and are primarily using their device for web browsing, productivity applications, and other tasks that are not heavily dependent on legacy x64 applications. In summary, while both Windows 64-bit and Windows 64-bit ARM serve the purpose of operating Windows environments on 64-bit systems, they cater to different hardware architectures, leading to variations in compatibility, performance, and intended use cases."},{"prompt":"Write a Kikoriki story where Rosa the Pig falls in thick, gray mud, and vanishes, the others worried, Meanwhile Krash the Rabbit attempts to win in a Roblox contest for free Robux","completion":"In the whimsical world of Kikoriki Island, adventure, and misadventures unfold with charm and hilarity at every turn. One fateful day, under a sky painted with swirls of orange and pink, the gang decided to explore the far reaches of their vibrant island—a land brimming with mysteries and laughter. Rosa, the always-optimistic pig with a passion for beauty and a penchant for pink, pranced alongside her friends, her curly tail bouncing with each step. Her eyes sparkled at the thought of discovering new flowers for her collection. Meanwhile, Krash, the ever-competitive rabbit, had a different kind of treasure hunt in mind. His big ears twitched as he spoke, \\"Guys, check this out!\\" He waved his tablet in the air, displaying a bright screen announcing a one-of-a-kind Roblox contest. \\"The ultimate challenge to win free Robux!\\" he proclaimed, his eyes gleaming with determination. \\"I can't miss this! Think of all the cool skins and games I could unlock!\\" While Krash's enthusiasm for the digital contest soared, the rest of the gang, including Chiko the Hedgehog, Wally the Ram, Dokko the Donkey, Carlin the Crow, and the others, followed Rosa into the heart of the island's untamed wilderness, their curiosity leading the way. The group weaved through lush, exotic flora and vibrant fauna, their laughter and chatter filling the air. However, in her excitement and haste, Rosa didn't notice the peril that lay ahead. With a surprised squeal, she stumbled into a hidden pit of thick, gray mud. In an instant, she was enveloped by the gloopy mire, vanishing from sight. Her squeal faded, swallowed by the mud. Panic ensued among the Kikoriki friends. \\"Rosa!\\" they cried, rushing to the edge of the pit, their expressions morphing from shock to worry. Back at the starting point of their adventure, Krash, oblivious to the drama unfolding, was tapping and swiping with fierce focus, his determination to win the Robux contest shining brightly in his eyes. It wasn't until Carlin, panting and flustered, arrived to relay the dire news about Rosa that Krash snapped back to reality. \\"Rosa's vanished in the mud!\\" Carlin croaked, his voice laced with urgency. Without a second thought, Krash's competitive fire was replaced by a surge of concern for his friend. The Roblox contest no longer mattered. What mattered was Rosa. The friends rallied together, their individual talents and strengths shining, as they embarked on a rescue mission to save Rosa from her muddy prison. Wally, with his unmatched strength, attempted to pull Rosa out, while Dokko used his inventive smarts to concoct a potion that would liquefy the mud. Chiko, with his keen eyes, guided them to the safest point of entry. Together, they worked, united by friendship and a shared resolve to bring Rosa back. After moments that felt like hours, their efforts bore fruit. Rosa emerged, covered head to hooves in mud but safe and sound, her smile beaming through the gray. The relief and joy were palpable, hugs and laughter shared among the tight-knit group. Rosa, ever the optimist, simply giggled, \\"Well, that was an unexpected spa day!\\" Krash, with a sheepish grin, apologized for his initial distraction. \\"I guess some contests aren't as important as I thought,\\" he admitted, earning an understanding nod from his friends. The day's adventure, with its ups and downs, taught the Kikoriki gang the value of real treasures—friendship, unity, and the unforgettable moments shared. And as for the Roblox contest? Krash learned that some rewards, those of the heart, could never be quantified by Robux. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the Kikoriki friends made their way home, a little muddier, a bit wiser, but closer than ever, their laughter echoing into the twilight, a testament to the enduring power of friendship."},{"prompt":"Which real-life Chinese public figure descended from the Ming dynasty's Imperial Family, the Imperial House of Zhu, would be Emperor of China today if the Ming was restored sometime after the Xinhai Revolution and the National Protection War between Yuan Shikai's Empire of China and the KMT-ruled Nationalist China, in which Shikai died after forming the Empire of China and the Zhu regained their power? Take in mind only the descendants of the Ming dynasty's last Emperor, Chongzhen and the Southern Ming's last Emperor, Yongli can become Chinese Emperor in this scenario. This is for a fanfic, so don't judge.","completion":"For your fanfic scenario, we'd need to look at the descendants of the last emperors of the Ming Dynasty, including Chongzhen, the last Ming emperor who ruled in the north, and the Southern Ming's last Emperor, Yongli. Regrettably, tracing the direct lineage of these emperors to a specific, well-documented, living individual is challenging due to the tumultuous periods following the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1644 and the subsequent fall of the Southern Ming. The primary difficulty arises from the fact that after the Ming dynasty fell, many supposed descendants went into hiding to avoid persecution by the Qing dynasty, which succeeded the Ming. Over the centuries, some families have maintained records of their lineage, but the accuracy and public acknowledgment of these claims can vary. **For Emperor Chongzhen (Zhu Youjian)**: Emperor Chongzhen, the last emperor of the Ming dynasty in the north, had several children. However, most of his immediate family faced tragic ends during the fall of Beijing to the rebel forces led by Li Zicheng and subsequently to the Qing. His direct descendants, if any survived, would have likely done so in utter secrecy to escape the Qing's purge. Chongzhen's lineage, thus, becomes murky and hard to trace to a contemporary figure. **For the Southern Ming's last Emperor, Yongli (Zhu Youlang)**: Emperor Yongli was one of the last emperors of the Southern Ming, a series of rump states that continued to resist the Qing after the capture of Beijing. Captured and executed by the Qing in 1662, tracing his descendants is similarly complex. While there are historical records of Yongli's offspring and possibly their immediate descendants, the lineage's continuation to the present would be difficult to verify. **Contemporary Claimants**: There are individuals and families in China and among the Chinese diaspora who claim descent from the Ming royal family. These claims are based on family records, genealogies, and oral histories. However, publicly recognized figures or individuals verified by historians as direct descendants of either Chongzhen or Yongli, positioned to claim an \\"Emperor of China\\" title today, are not well-documented in publicly accessible records as of my last knowledge update in September 2023. For your fanfic, you might find it more flexible to create a fictional descendant, imbued with verifiable lineage through imagined, meticulous records kept secret over centuries. This allows you to sidestep the complexities of actual genealogical tracing while providing a rich backstory and legitimacy to your character's claim to the throne. Crafting a narrative that includes secret societies, hidden records, or a family's generations-long quest to prove their lineage can add depth and intrigue to your story."},{"prompt":"What version of Minecraft was used on console in 2013?","completion":"In 2013, the version of Minecraft available on consoles would depend on the specific console in question, as releases varied by platform. - **Xbox 360**: The Xbox 360 Edition of Minecraft was being actively updated in 2013. During that year, it received several title updates, starting the year around Title Update 7 or 8 (which were released in late 2012) and ending the year around Title Update 13-14. These updates introduced features like The End, trading with villagers, anvils, and more, progressively bringing the console version closer to the Java Edition at the time. - **PlayStation 3**: Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition was released on December 17, 2013. So, by the end of 2013, PS3 players were getting their first taste of Minecraft on their console, starting with a version equivalent to an earlier Xbox 360 Edition update (approximately around what was present in Title Update 13/14 but tailored for the PS3 hardware). Minecraft: Xbox One Edition, Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition, and Minecraft: PlayStation Vita Edition were not released until 2014, so they were not available in 2013.

Bestimmte Krankheiten oder Schädlinge können das Knospenwachstum direkt beeinträchtigen oder den Baum so stark schwächen, dass er keine Energie für die Entwicklung neuer Knospen hat. 5. **Beschädigung des Baumes**: Überprüfe den Baum auf Beschädigungen, sei es durch mechanische Einwirkung, Tiere oder durch extreme Wetterbedingungen. Beschädigungen am Stamm oder den Wurzeln können die Nährstoff- und Wasserversorgung der Knospen beeinträchtigen. 6. **Lichtverhältnisse**: Eichen benötigen viel Sonnenlicht zum Wachsen. Wenn der Baum zu stark beschattet ist, könnte dies auch ein Grund für das Ausbleiben von Knospen sein. Es ist wichtig, die genaue Ursache zu identifizieren, um gezielte Gegenmaßnahmen ergreifen zu können. Manchmal kann die Beratung durch einen Fachmann, wie einem Förster oder einem Baumpfleger, notwendig sein, um die Gesundheit und Vitalität des Baumes wiederherzustellen."},{"prompt":"Welche Nährstoffe werden benötigt","completion":"Für ein gesundes Wachstum benötigen Eichen, wie die meisten Pflanzen, eine Vielzahl von Makro- und Mikronährstoffen. Untenstehend sind einige der wichtigsten Nährstoffe aufgeführt: # Makronährstoffe 1. **Stickstoff (N)**: Fördert das Blattwachstum und die allgemeine Vitalität der Pflanze. Stickstoffmangel zeigt sich oft in gelblichen, kleinen Blättern und einem verlangsamten Wachstum. 2. **Phosphor (P)**: Wichtig für die Entwicklung von Wurzeln, Blüten und Früchten. Phosphor hilft auch bei der Energieübertragung innerhalb der Pflanze. Mangelerscheinungen können verzögertes Wachstum und dunkelgrüne bis violette Blattfärbungen sein. 3. **Kalium (K)**: Unterstützt die allgemeine Pflanzengesundheit, verbessert die Winterhärte, reguliert den Wasserhaushalt und ist an der Photosynthese beteiligt. Kaliummangel äußert sich in braunen Blatträndern und schwachem Wachstum. 4. **Kalzium (Ca)**: Notwendig für die Zellwandstruktur und das Wachstum neuer Zellen in der Pflanze. Ein Mangel führt zu verformten Blättern und gestörter Wurzelebene. 5. **Magnesium (Mg)**: Zentraler Bestandteil des Chlorophylls, wichtig für die Photosynthese. Ein Mangel zeigt sich in Gelbfärbung zwischen den Blattadern älterer Blätter. 6. **Schwefel (S)**: Wichtig für die Produktion von Proteinen und einigen Vitaminen. Ein Mangel kann zu hellgrüner Färbung der Blätter führen. # Mikronährstoffe (Spurenelemente) 1. **Eisen (Fe)**: Notwendig für die Chlorophyllproduktion. Eisenmangel führt oft zu Chlorose, bei der junge Blätter gelb werden, während die Blattadern grün bleiben. 2. **Mangan (Mn)**: Wichtig für die Photosynthese und als Katalysator für Enzyme. Manganmangel äußert sich in ähnlichen Symptomen wie Magnesiummangel. 3. **Bor (B)**: Wichtig für die Zellwandbildung und Fruchtentwicklung. Mangel an Bor kann zu Wachstumsstörungen führen. 4. **Zink (Zn)**: Wichtig für die Produktion von Wachstumshormonen und die Unterstützung bei der Stärkung von Pflanzen gegenüber Kälte. Fehlt Zink, kann es zu Zwergwuchs der jungen Blätter und zu einem schlechten Wachstum kommen. 5. **Kupfer (Cu)**: Notwendig für die Photosynthese, die Proteinsynthese und als Aktivator für einige Enzyme. Kupfermangel kann zu Wachstumsstörungen führen. Um sicherzustellen, dass eine Eiche alle benötigten Nährstoffe erhält, kann es hilfreich sein, den Boden regelmäßig auf seinen Nährstoffgehalt testen zu lassen und gegebenenfalls über eine ausgewogene Düngung die notwendigen Makro- und Mikronährstoffe zuzuführen. Fein abgestimmte Dünger, die speziell für Bäume entwickelt wurden, können dabei unterstützen, eventuelle Nährstoffdefizite auszugleichen."},{"prompt":"Er ist in einem Blumentopf mit Pflanzenerde","completion":"Wenn Ihre zweijährige Eiche in einem Blumentopf mit Pflanzenerde wächst und im Frühjahr keine Knospen entwickelt, gibt es besondere Überlegungen, die berücksichtigt werden sollten: 1. **Topfgröße und Wurzelraum**: Eichen sind Bäume, die ein tiefes und weit verzweigtes Wurzelsystem entwickeln. Die Größe des Topfes könnte zu klein sein, um eine angemessene Wurzelexpansion zu ermöglichen, was die Fähigkeit des Baumes, Nährstoffe und Wasser aufzunehmen, einschränkt. Überprüfen Sie, ob der Baum umgetopft werden muss, um ihm mehr Raum zum Wachsen zu geben. 2. **Wasser- und Drainageverhältnisse**: Die Bewässerung in Töpfen muss sorgfältig gemanagt werden, da sowohl Über- als auch Unterwässerung Probleme verursachen können. Eichen vertragen keine „nassen Füße“; eine gute Drainage ist wesentlich, um Wurzelfäule zu vermeiden. Stellen Sie sicher, dass der Topf angemessene Drainagelöcher hat und die Pflanzenerde nicht zur Verdichtung neigt. 3. **Nährstoffversorgung**: In Töpfen lebende Pflanzen sind auf die Nährstoffe angewiesen, die im begrenzten Substratvolumen vorhanden sind. Im Gegensatz zu Bäumen im Freiland, die ihre Wurzeln ausbreiten können, um Nährstoffe zu suchen, benötigen Topfpflanzen regelmäßige Düngung, um ihr Wachstum zu unterstützen. Es kann notwendig sein, einen speziell formulierten Langzeitdünger für Bäume oder einen ausgewogenen, flüssigen Dünger zu nutzen, um einen gesunden Wachstumszyklus zu fördern. 4. **Erde und pH-Wert**: Die in Töpfen verwendete Pflanzenerde sollte eine für Eichen geeignete Textur und pH-Wert haben. Eichen bevorzugen in der Regel leicht saure bis neutrale Böden. Falls erforderlich, kann der pH-Wert mit speziellen Produkten angepasst werden. 5. **Wachstumsbedingungen**: Eichen benötigen viel direktes Sonnenlicht, um gesund zu wachsen. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihr Topf-Eichenbaum an einem Standort positioniert ist, der genügend Sonnenlicht über den Tag erhält. Mangelndes Licht kann das Wachstum einschränken und die Knospenbildung behindern. 6. **Umpflanzen**: Betrachten Sie die Möglichkeit, die Eiche auszupflanzen, wenn es die Bedingungen erlauben. Eichen entwickeln sich am besten, wenn sie im Freiland wachsen können, wo ihr Wurzelsystem sich ungehindert ausbreiten kann. Bei der Pflege einer Eiche in einem Topf ist es wichtig, regelmäßig die genannten Aspekte zu überprüfen und anzupassen, um den Baum gesund und wachsend zu halten."},{"prompt":"Best Mario game?","completion":"Determining the \\"best\\" Mario game can be quite subjective, as it largely depends on individual preferences, gaming experiences, and what one values in a game.

Each of these titles received a mixed reception upon release, primarily due to significant deviations from the formula established by earlier entries in the series, particularly \\"Paper Mario\\" for the N64 and \\"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\\" for the GameCube. However, over time, each of these games has garnered a more appreciative audience that values their unique contributions to the series. The choice between them largely depends on individual aspects of gameplay and story that fans might prefer, but here we’ll focus on \\"Color Splash\\" as the more commonly cited underrated title. # \\"Paper Mario: Color Splash\\" (Wii U) Released in 2016 for the Wii U, \\"Paper Mario: Color Splash\\" continues the trend away from the RPG roots of the series towards a more action-adventure oriented gameplay with puzzle-solving elements. This game is often considered underrated for the following reasons: 1. **Visuals and Presentation:** - \\"Color Splash\\" boasts some of the best visuals in the series, with a beautifully rendered paper and paint aesthetic. The game world is vibrant, colorful, and full of charming details that take full advantage of the paper theme. 2. **Humor and Writing:** - Much like its predecessors, \\"Color Splash\\" is filled with witty dialogue, humorous situations, and clever puns. Many fans and critics praise the game for its strong writing and the distinct personalities of its characters. 3. **Innovative Gameplay Mechanics:** - Despite criticism for continuing the combat system shift initiated by \\"Sticker Star,\\" \\"Color Splash\\" introduces clever paint and card mechanics that are both thematic and engage with puzzles and battles in a unique way. The painting mechanics add a fresh layer to exploration and interactions within the game world. 4. **Soundtrack:** - The score of \\"Color Splash\\" is well-regarded, offering a wide range of styles and memorable tunes that complement the game’s various environments and situations perfectly. The criticism of \\"Color Splash\\" often centers around its battle system and departure from the RPG elements that defined the early success of the series. However, many players who look past these changes find a charming, witty, and visually stunning game. For those reasons, \\"Paper Mario: Color Splash\\" stands out as a particularly underrated entry in the Paper Mario series, deserving of a second look from those who may have passed it over due to its initial reception or the underperformance of the Wii U console itself."},{"prompt":"Which are the most popular Paper Mario games","completion":"The most popular Paper Mario games, considering both critical acclaim and fan affection, are generally considered to be the first two entries in the series: \\"Paper Mario\\" for the Nintendo 64 and \\"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\\" for the GameCube.

The game's narrative depth, character development, humor, and creative level design have made it not only the most beloved entry in the Paper Mario series but also one of the most cherished GameCube games. These two games are often cited by fans as the pinnacle of the Paper Mario series and are cherished for staying true to the RPG roots that defined their early success. Their popularity has endured, with many fans frequently calling for Nintendo to return the series to its original gameplay style. # Honorable Mentions - **Super Paper Mario (Wii)**: While deviating from the RPG formula by incorporating platforming elements and real-time combat, it received praise for its story, innovative gameplay, and breaking of the fourth wall. Its unique approach has garnered it a dedicated fanbase, making it a noteworthy entry in the series. - **Paper Mario: Color Splash (Wii U)** and **Paper Mario: The Origami King (Switch)**: These newer entries took the series in a different direction with mixed reactions from the fanbase but have nonetheless cultivated their own popularity for different reasons, including humor, visuals, and innovation in gameplay mechanics.

However, it's important to note that even these titles maintain significant RPG elements and the unique paper-based aesthetic that sets the Paper Mario series apart from mainline Mario platformers. \\"Sticker Star\\" and \\"Color Splash\\" minimized the role-playing elements seen in earlier entries like \\"Paper Mario\\" for the Nintendo 64 and \\"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\\" for the GameCube. They feature a greater focus on puzzle-solving and exploration over the deep narrative and character development that were hallmarks of the earlier games. Additionally, \\"Sticker Star\\" and \\"Color Splash\\" utilize a combat system that is simpler and more gimmick-based, with attacks tied to collectible items (stickers in \\"Sticker Star\\" and paint in \\"Color Splash\\") rather than the traditional RPG turn-based battle system with leveling up through experience points. Despite these shifts, the Paper Mario games, including \\"Sticker Star\\" and \\"Color Splash,\\" are still distinct from mainline Mario titles due to their unique aesthetics and gameplay mechanics. So while they may feel closer to regular Mario games compared to their RPG-heavy predecessors, they still offer a distinctly different experience from traditional Mario platformers."},{"prompt":"Write a SMO/SPM story","completion":"Title: The Quest for the Solar Phantom Module Once in a distant future, where technology had woven itself into the very fabric of the universe and space travel was as common as a morning stroll, there existed a legendary device known as the Solar Phantom Module (SPM). This mythical device was said to possess the power to harness the energy of stars in a way humanity had never before achieved, making interstellar travel not just faster, but almost instantaneous. The Search for the SMO (Solar Master Operator), the only being capable of controlling the SPM, became the greatest quest of the era. The story begins on the Vagabond Space Station, where a young and daring engineer named Elara Caden receives a cryptic message from her long-lost grandmother, who was rumored to have been part of the secretive team that developed the Solar Phantom Module. With nothing but the message, a set of complex coordinates, and an insatiable curiosity, Elara sets off on a journey across the stars. Elara's quest brings her team together, each member drawn by their own reasons: Kael, a pilot with unparalleled skills but a mysterious past; Nova, a cybernetic hacker who dreams of a life beyond the screens; and Zan, an alien scholar fascinated by human technology. The team’s first clue leads them to the desert planet of Solara, where beneath its endless dunes lie the remnants of ancient civilizations and the promise of finding the key to the SPM. It's there they encounter the Guardians, a secretive group sworn to protect the secrets of the SPM from falling into the wrong hands. The Guardians challenge Elara and her team, testing their resolve, their wisdom, and their combat skills. Through trials of intellect, strength, and heart, Elara’s team proves themselves to the Guardians, who reveal that the SPM was dismantled and its pieces scattered across the galaxy to prevent its power from being misused. The coordinates Elara received were the first in a series, each leading to a piece of the SPM. As they travel from planet to planet, Elara and her companions are pursued by the Dominion, a ruthless interstellar corporation that seeks the SPM for their own nefarious purposes. They face treacherous landscapes, battle hostile creatures, and unravel ancient puzzles. But with each step, the bonds between them grow stronger, their resolve firmer. Eventually, their quest leads them to the heart of a dying star, where the final piece of the SPM is said to reside. There, in the star's last moments, they confront the Dominion in a spectacular battle. With time running out and the star about to go supernova, Elara realizes the true power of the SPM: it isn't just the device itself, but the unity and determination of those who seek it for the right reasons. In the end, Elara's team manages to activate the SPM, using its power not for dominion or control but to save the surrounding systems from the dying star's catastrophic explosion. The Solar Phantom Module, with Elara now recognized as the true Solar Master Operator (SMO), becomes a beacon of hope and a symbol of humanity's ability to rise above its base desires for power. Despite achieving their quest, Elara and her team understand that their journey has only just begun. Together, they venture forth, guardians of the SPM, dedicated to exploring the vast unknown and ensuring the safety of the universe. And so, the legend of the SMO and the Solar Phantom Module lives on, not just as a tale of technology and power, but as a timeless story of adventure, friendship, and the unyielding spirit of exploration that defines us all."},{"prompt":"Write a detailed plot summary of a hypothetical movie that is a combination of Frozen (2013) and Zootopia (2016).","completion":"**Title:** \\"Frozen Kingdoms\\" **Setting:** A fantastical world where anthropomorphic animals inhabit a vast, divided land. Half of this world is a bustling, modern metropolis known as Zootroplis, where mammals of every kind live in harmony. The other half is an enchanted, perpetually winter kingdom called Frostia, ruled by a family with the secret power to control ice and snow. **Plot Summary:** **Act 1:** The story begins in Frostia, where Queen Elsa, a graceful snow leopard with the magical ability to control ice and snow, prepares to pass on her crown to her younger sister, Princess Anna, a vibrant red fox full of curiosity and adventure. As the coronation day approaches, rumors spread across the land about a mysterious artifact known as the Heart of Nature, which is said to have the power to blend the boundaries between Zootroplis and Frostia, creating a harmonious world where winter and the urban life coexist. Curious and excited by the legend, Anna ventures out to find the artifact, hoping it would make her a worthy queen. Elsa, fearing for her sister's safety and the potential consequences of the Heart of Nature’s power, goes after Anna, accompanied by Kristoff, a rugged bison ice harvester, and his loyal reindeer, Sven. **Act 2:** Meanwhile, in Zootroplis, Judy Hopps, an ambitious and optimistic bunny police officer, stumbles upon a conspiracy involving the disappearance of mammals who ventured into Frostia, never to return. Reluctantly, she teams up with Nick Wilde, a sly fox con artist with a heart of gold, to uncover the truth. Their investigation leads them to the legend of the Heart of Nature, and thus, their paths cross with Elsa and Anna's. As the two groups converge, they face myriad obstacles, from fierce snowstorms summoned by Elsa’s uncontrollable powers to navigating the bustling urban jungle of Zootroplis while evading capture by the city's authorities, who are skeptical of Elsa’s magic and the existence of Frostia. Along the way, they encounter an enigmatic Arctic wolf known as Rune, who reveals himself to be the true seeker of the Heart of Nature with the intention of erasing the borders forever, believing it to be the only way to unite the two worlds. **Act 3:** The combined group of Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, Judy, and Nick realizes that Rune’s intentions, though noble, could lead to catastrophic consequences that might erase the uniqueness of both domains. They strive to stop Rune, leading to a climactic battle on the ice fields of Frostia. Elsa and Judy harness their unique strengths, leading their friends in a fight that sees the Heart of Nature shattered, dispersing its energy harmlessly into the atmosphere, reinforcing the border yet creating a newfound respect and understanding between the two worlds. In the aftermath, Elsa decides that the crowning of Anna will be delayed, as they both need to learn more about their own kingdom and the world beyond. Judy and Nick return to Zootroplis as heroes, with stories of their adventure and the realization that understanding and cooperation can overcome the greatest of divisions. The movie ends with Zootroplis and Frostia opening diplomatic channels, and the beginning of an exchange program where citizens from both sides can visit and learn from each other. Elsa ensures that a controlled passage between the worlds remains open, cementing her legacy as a queen who looks forward to a future where unity prevails. **Themes:** \\"Frozen Kingdoms\\" explores themes of understanding, courage, and unity, illustrating how diverse communities can overcome misunderstandings and fear to live in harmony. It celebrates the strengths in differences, the power of friendship across diverse backgrounds, and the importance of caring for the natural world that sustains us all."},{"prompt":"如何在springboot jpa中启用h2数据的端口，让其他数据库管理软件接入","completion":"在Spring Boot中，使用JPA时很容易集成H2数据库，无论是作为开发时的内存数据库，还是作为一个独立的服务运行。若你希望在开发过程中能够让其他数据库管理软件访问H2数据库，你需要通过一些配置使其在TCP模式下运行，从而监听一个端口，而不是仅在内存模式下运行。以下是如何进行配置的步骤： # 步骤一：引入H2数据库依赖 首先，确保你的\`pom.xml\`或\`build.gradle\`中引入了H2数据库的依赖。以Maven为例： \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>com.h2database</groupId> <artifactId>h2</artifactId> <version>最新版本</version> <scope>runtime</scope> </dependency> \`\`\` # 步骤二：配置\`application.properties\` 在\`src/main/resources/application.properties\`文件中，添加相关配置以启用H2数据库的TCP服务器模式。这样，既可以通过应用访问数据库，也可以通过TCP/IP访问数据库。 \`\`\`properties # 开启H2控制台 spring.h2.console.enabled=true spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console # 数据库配置 spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver spring.datasource.username=sa spring.datasource.password= # JPA 相关配置，视具体情况而定 spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect \`\`\` 注意：在\`spring.datasource.url\`配置中，你可以根据需要调整数据库文件的位置和名称（如\`~/test\`）。 # 步骤三：启用H2的TCP服务 为了使H2数据库在TCP模式下运行，需要在应用启动时运行TCP服务器。可以通过编码的方式或者命令行直接启动。 编码方式启动 在Spring Boot应用中，可以通过编写一个\`@Bean\`方法来启动H2的TCP服务器，示例如下： \`\`\`java import org.h2.tools.Server; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import java.sql.SQLException; @Configuration public class H2ServerConfiguration { // 启动H2数据库的TCP服务器模式 @Bean(initMethod=\\"start\\", destroyMethod=\\"stop\\") public Server h2TcpServer() throws SQLException { return Server.createTcpServer(\\"-tcp\\", \\"-tcpAllowOthers\\", \\"-tcpPort\\", \\"9092\\"); } } \`\`\` 确保TCP服务器的端口（此处为\`9092\`）未被占用，并且符合你的网络环境和安全要求。 命令行启动 如果你喜欢直接使用命令行启动H2的TCP服务器，可以通过如下命令： \`\`\`bash java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server -tcp -tcpAllowOthers -tcpPort 9092 \`\`\` 请根据实际的\`jar\`文件名修改上述命令中的\`h2*.jar\`。 # 步骤四：通过数据库管理工具连接 现在，你可以使用任意支持JDBC的数据库管理工具通过TCP连接到你的H2数据库了。连接URL大致如下： \`\`\` jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/test \`\`\` 用户名和密码按照你在\`application.properties\`中的配置填写即可。 完成上述步骤后，就能使其他数据库管理软件通过TCP/IP协议访问H2数据库，从而进行数据库管理和数据查询等操作。"},{"prompt":"这是我原来的配置方式： spring: datasource: url: jdbc:h2:file:{app.h2db-path};DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE driverClassName: org.h2.Driver username: capital4j-client password: capital4j-client 你这样配置，数据文件的路径怎么办","completion":"如果你想要在启用H2数据库TCP服务器模式的同时，指定数据库文件的路径，可以在\`spring.datasource.url\`中指定文件的具体路径。你之前提供的配置中包含了一个环境变量\`{app.h2db-path}\`来动态指定数据库文件的存储路径。这是一个很好的做法，因为它提高了配置的灵活性，尤其是在不同环境下运行时。 当你希望其他数据库管理软件能够接入时，需要确保\`spring.datasource.url\`配置正确指向这个文件路径，并且启动H2的TCP服务器。 以你提供的配置为例，如果你想保持使用文件系统中的数据库（而非内存中的数据库），同时允许通过TCP/IP协议访问，你可以这样配置： \`\`\`properties # 修改后的配置 spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/{app.h2db-path};DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE;MODE=MySQL spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver spring.datasource.username=capital4j-client spring.datasource.password=capital4j-client \`\`\` 在上面的配置中： - \`{app.h2db-path}\`: 这是环境变量或Spring Boot配置属性，指向你的数据库文件。确保这个变量在使用之前已经被正确定义，例如可以在\`application.properties\`中或者通过启动参数传递。 - \`jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/{app.h2db-path}\`: 指示应用通过TCP连接到本地主机上的H2数据库，\`app.h2db-path\`的值将被解析为数据库文件的实际路径。 请确保： 1. H2的TCP服务器模式已被启用（如之前所述，可以通过编码方式或命令行启动H2的TCP服务器）。 2. \`{app.h2db-path}\`确实指向了正确的数据库文件路径。若是相对路径，它是相对于工程目录或者指定的工作目录。 # 注意： - 如果你是在开发环境中使用H2并希望数据在重启后仍然存在，使用文件数据库（而非内存数据库）是正确的选择。 - 确保TCP服务器的端口没有被其他服务占用。 - \`DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE\`和其他任何参数都可以根据你的具体需求进行调整。 最后，为了访问\`h2-console\`或使得其他数据库管理软件能够连接到你的H2数据库，确保你已正确配置安全规则，允许访问对应的端口和路径。"},{"prompt":"Write a Mario story based off SPM and SMO","completion":"Once upon a time, in the vast and varied universe where both the Mushroom Kingdom and countless other worlds coexisted, a new adventure beckoned to Mario, the ever-brave and iconic plumber. This tale unfurled after the events of \\"Super Paper Mario\\" (SPM) and \\"Super Mario Odyssey\\" (SMO), weaving a narrative that solicited Mario's courage and wisdom gained from his previous quests. In the aftermath of defeating Count Bleck and stopping the Chaos Heart in SPM, and rescuing Princess Peach and thwarting Bowser's matrimonial plans in SMO, peace had seemingly returned. Mario had returned to his routine of peaceful days in the Mushroom Kingdom. However, this calm was abruptly interrupted when Luigi burst into Mario's house, holding a letter with mysterious, yet familiar handwriting. It was from Tippi, or Timpani, who had transcended dimensions to live a new life with Blumiere. They were reaching out across the multiverse, desperate for help. An unseen and mystifying force was merging the boundaries between the paper-thin realities of their world and the more rounded, three-dimensional realms Mario had explored in his Odyssey. This force threatened to collapse the universe into chaos, undoing the fabric of reality itself. Understanding the gravity of the situation, Mario didn't hesitate. He donned his cap, now infused with the essence of Cappy, his ally from his Odyssey, who provided him the ability to transcend the limitations of his own physical form. Together, they set off to investigate this multidimensional crisis. Their journey first led them back to Flipside, where they reunited with old friends and allies such as Merlon and Nastasia. With their guidance, Mario and Cappy learned that the source of the disturbance was a powerful artifact known as the Reality Star, a relic so potent it could merge or separate dimensions at the wielder's whim. As Mario traversed through various dimensions, from the vibrant and ever-shifting landscapes of the Paper Mario universe to the grand and expanse worlds he visited in his Odyssey, he encountered familiar faces and foes. Bowser, ever the antagonist, sought the Reality Star for his own desires of conquest, forcing Mario to once again thwart his plans. Yet, this adventure required more than just stopping Bowser; it demanded unity among all realms. Along his journey, Mario united heroes from both paper and three-dimensional worlds; from Paper Peach to Pauline, and from the Rabbids to the Lumas, each played a pivotal role. They encountered worlds where paper and 3D elements coexisted in harmony, teaching them the beauty of diversity and the strength found in unity. In the climax of their adventure, the group confronted the guardian of the Reality Star, a celestial being disillusioned by the conflicts and disharmony among the various dimensions. Moved by the unity and friendship among Mario and his diverse band of allies, the guardian realized that true harmony required not the separation of worlds, but their coexistence. The Reality Star was used one last time, not to divide or merge realms completely but to stabilize the connections between them, allowing passage but preserving the uniqueness of each world. With the balance restored, the universes were saved from collapsing into chaos. Mario, heroes from both the paper and 3D realms, celebrated their victory, acknowledging that their newfound bonds transcended the dimensions they hailed from. The adventure concluded with Mario and Cappy observing the sunset from the highest tower in Flipside, contemplating the endless possibility of worlds and the endless adventures that awaited. But for now, peace was restored, thanks to the courage, unity, and the undying spirit of adventure that lived within Mario, his allies, and the friendship that bound them across all realms."},{"prompt":"What if Super paper Mario had Cappy","completion":"If Super Paper Mario had Cappy, the unique character from \\"Super Mario Odyssey,\\" it would introduce a series of fascinating dynamics and potentially alter the game's fundamental mechanics. \\"Super Paper Mario,\\" released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007, is known for its blend of platforming and RPG elements, alongside a story that involves flipping between dimensions. Cappy, on the other hand, is a character introduced in \\"Super Mario Odyssey\\" for the Nintendo Switch in 2017, which gives Mario the ability to possess or \\"capture\\" other characters and objects to gain new abilities. Incorporating Cappy into \\"Super Paper Mario\\" could significantly enhance the gameplay in various ways: # New Puzzle Elements Cappy could introduce new puzzle mechanics, allowing Mario to capture enemies or objects to solve puzzles that were previously unsolvable or required different methods. This could add variety and depth to the puzzles encountered throughout the game. # Exploration and Accessibility With Cappy's ability to capture and control different characters and objects, areas of the game that were previously inaccessible could now be explored. This could lead to discovering new secrets, shortcuts, or even hidden areas within the game's world. # Combat Mechanics The combat system in \\"Super Paper Mario\\" could be greatly diversified with Cappy. Players could capture enemies to use their unique abilities against other foes, adding a strategic layer to battles. This would offer a more varied combat experience beyond the traditional jumping and item use. # Story Implications Integrating Cappy into the story of \\"Super Paper Mario\\" would mean reimagining the narrative to some extent. The story could explore the origin of Cappy in the Paper Mario universe or how Mario comes to partner with him. This collaboration could provide a fresh narrative twist and new character dynamics for the game. # Multiplayer Potential \\"Super Mario Odyssey\\" allows a second player to control Cappy in a limited but cooperative gameplay experience. Implementing similar functionality in \\"Super Paper Mario\\" could enhance the game by introducing cooperative play, where one player controls Mario and another controls Cappy. This could make traversing the game's levels and solving puzzles together a fun experience for two players. However, it's important to note that introducing a character like Cappy to \\"Super Paper Mario\\" would require careful balancing to ensure that the game remains challenging and engaging without becoming overpowered or trivializing the game's puzzles and obstacles. The developers would need to integrate Cappy in a way that feels organic to the game's world and mechanics, potentially leading to a significantly different but exciting gameplay experience."},{"prompt":"write me a professional description for my blog on blogger called GAMING CLOUDS ,specifically in the field of games","completion":"Welcome to Gaming Clouds, your ultimate destination for all things related to the world of gaming.

However, I can certainly guide you through the process of designing a professional-looking template for a blogger site, especially one geared towards affiliate marketing. Below are the key elements and steps you might want to consider when creating your template: # 1. Brainstorm Your Design - **Niche Focus:** Tailor your design to match your niche. The aesthetics should resonate with the target audience you’re trying to attract. For example, a tech affiliate blog might have a sleek, modern look, while a home gardening affiliate blog might use more earthy tones and natural imagery. - **Layout:** Decide on a layout that promotes readability and easy navigation. Most professional blogs have a clear, uncluttered layout emphasizing content. # 2. Prioritize Mobile Responsiveness - Ensure your template is mobile-responsive. A significant portion of internet traffic comes from mobile devices, and you want your affiliates links to be easily clickable across all devices. # 3. SEO Optimization - Pay attention to Search Engine Optimization (SEO) fundamentals, including fast loading times, proper use of headings (H1, H2, etc.), and alt text for images. Your template should facilitate these aspects rather than hinder them. # 4. Affiliate Elements Integration - **Product Showcase Areas:** Design areas where affiliate products can be showcased effectively. These could be sidebar widgets, a \\"top products\\" section, or embedded within the content. - **CTAs:** Make sure to incorporate clear, compelling call-to-action (CTA) buttons or links. Your CTA design should stand out and encourage clicks without being too intrusive. - **Disclosure Notice:** Affiliate marketing requires transparency with your audience. Ensure there’s a designated area to display your affiliate disclosure clearly. # 5. Choose Your Platform and Tools - If you’re not experienced in web design or coding, consider using a blog platform with customizable templates like WordPress. WordPress, in particular, offers numerous themes that can be customized to meet your needs and plugins designed to facilitate affiliate marketing. # 6. Legal Compliance - Make sure your template includes features that help you comply with legal requirements, such as cookie consent banners if necessary. # 7. Testing - Before going live, thoroughly test your template on various devices and browsers to ensure everything works as expected and that the affiliate links are functioning correctly. # 8. Feedback and Iteration - After launching, gather feedback from your audience and use analytics to understand how users interact with your site. Use this information to make informed adjustments to your template. Although I can’t design it for you upfront, using these guidelines, you should be able to brainstorm, sketch out, and then either develop your own blogger template or customize an existing one to suit your affiliate marketing needs. If you lack coding skills, consider using website building tools or hiring a professional web designer who can translate your requirements into a fully functional and professional blogger template."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical \\"Secret Diary of a Call Girl\\" episode - Belle has a female client that wants to be programmed as a female maid robot (no sex.) .. Belle struggles for ideas...","completion":"In this hypothetical episode of \\"Secret Diary of a Call Girl,\\" Belle faces a unique and intriguing challenge that pushes her outside of her typical comfort zone. The episode opens with Belle receiving a peculiar request from a new client, Ms. Clarkson, a successful businesswoman with a peculiar kink: she wants to live out a fantasy in which she is programmed to be a female maid robot. Unlike her usual work, this request involves no sexual activities; it’s all about fulfilling a niche fantasy. Belle is initially perplexed by the request. She's accustomed to a range of desires and fetishes from her clients, but this stands out due to its distinct nature and the specific non-sexual role she's asked to play. Intrigued and always up for a challenge, Belle decides to accept the request, diving into research on role-play, robot behavior, and the psychology behind such fantasies. To prepare, Belle transforms her apartment into a suitable \\"stage\\" for the fantasy, equipping it with props that mirror a futuristic setting. She studies robot movements and speech patterns to convincingly portray the programmer who will 'activate' and 'program' Ms. Clarkson, the maid robot. Belle's preparations are meticulous, reflecting her dedication regardless of the task. The anticipation builds as Ms. Clarkson arrives. She's visibly nervous but excited to immerse herself in this fantasy. Belle steps into character, adopting a professional demeanor as she begins the 'programming' process, guiding Ms. Clarkson into her role as a maid robot. She uses a mix of command cues, light hypnosis, and role-play scenarios to help Ms. Clarkson transition into her character. As the episode progresses, viewers are shown the depth of Belle's versatility and empathy. Although she initially struggled for ideas, her dedication to her client's satisfaction is evident. The interaction between Belle and Ms. Clarkson evolves into a profound connection, where both women explore themes of control, autonomy, and escape from daily pressures. In a touching final scene, Ms. Clarkson, now out of character, expresses her gratitude to Belle. She shares that the experience allowed her to surrender control, something she rarely does in her demanding professional life. This moment of vulnerability leads to a heartfelt conversation between the two women, touching on their desires to occasionally step away from their realities. The episode concludes with Belle reflecting in her diary, contemplating the vast spectrum of human desire and the intimate connections formed when people share and indulge in their deepest fantasies. She notes how this experience challenged her preconceptions and enriched her understanding of her clients' needs, emphasizing the emotional, rather than merely physical, aspects of her work. This hypothetical episode not only highlights Belle's professional adaptability and personal growth but also broadens the show's exploration of sexuality and human psychology, reaffirming its commitment to nuanced storytelling that respects the complexity of its characters and their clients."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical “Secret Diary of a Call Girl” episode - Belle decides to experience life as a housemaid (No sex) - However Lydia is stricter than Belle thought (yet historically accurate).","completion":"In a thought-provoking twist on \\"Secret Diary of a Call Girl,\\" Belle finds herself intrigued by the concept of living out a day in the life of a historical housemaid. Driven by a curiosity to understand and immerse herself in the experiences of women from different walks of life and eras, Belle takes up the role under the supervision of Lydia, a strict, no-nonsense housekeeper known for her adherence to historically accurate standards and practices. At the outset, Belle approaches this new undertaking with her usual mix of excitement and confidence, viewing it as a mere role-play exercise devoid of her typical occupational hazards. She imagines a day filled with light dusting, perhaps donning a quaint maid’s outfit, and engaging in what she assumes will be an easy and somewhat educational experience. However, as Belle soon discovers, the reality of being a historical housemaid is vastly different and more challenging than she anticipated. Lydia, acting as the housekeeper, sets the tone from the very beginning, outlining a rigorous schedule that starts before dawn and ends late into the evening. Belle is tasked with an array of duties ranging from back-breaking floor scrubbing to intricate silver polishing, all while adhering to a strict code of conduct and hierarchy that leaves little room for rest or error. The episode artfully contrasts Belle's modern perspectives with Lydia's insistence on historical accuracy, highlighting the often romanticized views of the past. Belle's struggles with the physical demands of her tasks, along with the rigid structure and discipline required, serve as an eye-opening experience. Viewers witness Belle grappling with the harsh realities faced by women servants throughout history, offering a stark contrast to her usual independence and control over her work environment. As the day progresses, Belle's initial enthusiasm wanes, replaced by exhaustion and a newfound respect for the resilience of the women who lived and worked under such conditions. Her interactions with Lydia evolve from mere instructional moments to deeper discussions about women's roles, societal expectations, and the evolution of labor rights. In a reflective moment, Lydia shares her motivations for maintaining such strict adherence to historical accuracy, emphasizing the importance of remembering and honoring the struggles and contributions of past generations. This leads Belle to contemplate the progress made by women, the freedoms enjoyed in the present, and the ongoing challenges that remain. By the episode's end, Belle’s diary entry reveals her profound admiration for the strength and endurance of historical housemaids. She acknowledges the luxury of choice in her present-day life and work—a choice not afforded to many women in the past. This realization deepens her empathy and understanding, fueling a renewed appreciation for the diverse experiences of women across history and society. This hypothetical episode challenges both Belle and the audience to consider the complexities of women's work and rights through history. By stepping out of her comfort zone and into the shoes of a housemaid, Belle gains invaluable insights, bridging the gap between past and present while enriching her perspective on her own life and career."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical “Secret Diary of a Call Girl” episode - Belle is asked to be a robot for a music video (No sex), She's wondering if she'll ever get the stylised costume and makeup off :)","completion":"In this imaginative episode of \\"Secret Diary of a Call Girl,\\" Belle finds herself venturing into an entirely new realm that blends her skills in role-playing with the fantastical world of entertainment. She is approached by a cutting-edge, indie music producer who is known for his visually striking and thematic music videos. The producer is fascinated by Belle's reputation for versatility and her ability to immerse herself into any role, making her the perfect candidate for his latest project—a music video that revolves around a futuristic society where robots and humans coexist. The episode kicks off with Belle's excitement about trying something new and her slight apprehension regarding stepping into the unfamiliar territory of the music industry. She meets with the producer and the creative team, who explain the concept: Belle will play the lead role of a highly advanced robot designed to emulate human emotions and interactions flawlessly. Her character is central to the narrative, exploring themes of identity, technology, and connection in a visually compelling way. As Belle begins her transformation into the robot character, the audience is treated to a behind-the-scenes look at the meticulous process. The costume design is intricate and highly stylized, featuring sleek, metallic elements that are both futuristic and elegant. The makeup is equally elaborate, with chrome accents and subtle LED lighting embedded to create an otherworldly glow. The attention to detail is astonishing, fully immersing Belle into her role as she begins to move and interact with the precision and grace of a machine. Throughout the filming, Belle is challenged to express a wide range of emotions without the usual human imperfections, embodying the character's struggle to understand and replicate human feelings. The director pushes her to her limits, seeking to capture the perfect blend of humanity and artificiality. Belle finds herself enjoying the process, marveling at the creativity and complexity of the production. However, as the shoot progresses, she starts to share her concerns about the extensive costume and makeup. The layers of makeup, prosthetics, and the tight, restrictive costume make her wonder half-jokingly if she'll ever return to her usual self. The climax of the episode occurs during the final shoot, where Belle's character experiences a moment of true connection and emotion, blurring the lines between robot and human. It's a powerful scene that leaves everyone on set, including Belle, deeply moved. As the long day wraps up and Belle begins the painstaking process of removing the elaborate makeup and costume, she reflects on the experience. The episode closes with Belle sitting in front of her dressing room mirror, slowly transforming back to herself, layer by layer. It's a metaphorical and literal unmasking, prompting a diary entry where Belle ponders the roles we play in our everyday lives and the masks we wear. She muses on the experience of losing herself in a character so unlike any she's played before and the irony of finding a deeper connection to her humanity through the lens of a robot. This quirky and reflective episode not only provides a creative outlet for Belle but also delves into broader themes about the essence of being human in a rapidly evolving digital age. It leaves viewers with lingering thoughts on identity, transformation, and the intricate dance between technology and humanity."},{"prompt":"write an astrological interpretation for the transit of jupiter conjunct uranus in less than 100 words, write it in the style of a 2pac rap","completion":"Yo, when Jupiter kisses Uranus in the sky, it's like life blasts through a fiery hoop, no lie.

Rune's personality is a blend of Prince Hans from Frozen and Dawn Bellwether from Zootopia. He's secretly evil but pretends not to be, like Hans and Bellwether.","completion":"Name: Rune Appearance: Rune is a striking figure among the arctic wolf pack, standing with a sleek and commanding presence. His fur is a pristine white, blending seamlessly with the snowy landscape he calls home, except for the unique silver markings that adorn his forehead, akin to ancient runes, from which he derives his name. His eyes are a piercing ice blue, cool and calculating, and when he looks at you, it feels as though he's peering straight through to your soul. Rune's posture is always composed, carrying himself with a regal grace attributed to his lineage and position. His movements are controlled and deliberate, making him appear serene and confident. Yet, behind his calm and collected exterior lurks a calculative and conniving mind. Personality: Rune embodies a charm and eloquence that endears him to many within and beyond his pack. He speaks with a smooth, reassuring tone, often laced with persuasive rhetoric that disarms those around him. Rune has cultivated an image of a caring and principled leader, deeply concerned with the welfare of his pack and the balance of the arctic ecosystem. However, beneath this veneer of benevolence and nobility lies a heart that is cold and manipulative, mirroring the icy plains he dominates. Like Prince Hans from Frozen, Rune is adept at wearing the mask of the trusted confidant, only to reveal his true intentions when it serves his purpose. He is able to feign sincerity and kindness, making it difficult for others to suspect him of deceit. Rune's ambition knows no bounds, and he utilizes his intelligence and charm to manipulate situations to his advantage, always staying ten steps ahead of his peers. Echoing Dawn Bellwether from Zootopia, Rune harbors a deep-seated resentment and ambition that drive his every action. While Bellwether sought control out of a sense of vengeance and a desire to upturn the status quo, Rune's motivations are rooted in a thirst for power and control, underpinned by a belief in his inherent superiority. He believes that by controlling the harsh and unforgiving environment of the arctic, and manipulating the dynamics of the pack, he can establish a new order under his undisputed rule. Rune is an expert at playing the long game, patiently setting his plans in motion with meticulous care. His ability to feign compassion and understanding allows him to gather followers and allies unwittingly to his cause. Rune's intelligence and strategic thinking make him a formidable opponent, as he can anticipate the moves of others and counter them with cold precision. Yet, for all his cunning and manipulation, Rune is careful to maintain his image as the noble and kind-hearted leader, believing that the perception of power can be just as influential as power itself. His ultimate goal is to reign supreme over the arctic, with a loyal pack that follows him not out of fear, but out of genuine belief in his leadership—a belief that he cultivates through deceit and manipulation, making him a truly dangerous adversary. In summary, Rune is a complex character, embodying the charismatic yet secretly malevolent nature of Prince Hans and Dawn Bellwether. His outward appearance of calm and benevolence masks a ruthless ambition and a cunning mind, dedicated to achieving power and control at any cost."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like you're looking to ask a question but haven't specified the topic yet.

Тактика Армии 1 может включать в себя использование лучников и рейнджеров для ослабления врага с расстояния, крестьян в качестве первой линии обороны (хотя их эффективность сомнительна), копейщиков и мечников для удержания линии фронта, кавалерию для прорывов через вражеские ряды и как ответ на вражескую тяжелую пехоту. # Армия 2 Армия 2 состоит из варварских и мифологических созданий: - **Пехота**: 60 гоблинов с костяными дубинками и 16 огров с двуручными топорами, дополненные 8 лордами огров, представляют сильную фронтовую атаку. - **Дальнобойные войска и поддержка**: 32 орка и 16 вождей орков с арбалетами для дистанционной поддержки. - **Специальные юниты**: 30 волков для быстрых атак и разведки, 12 троллей с метательными булыжниками и их боевые версии, а также 12 циклопов, которые вероятно могут поражать мощными ударами или магическими атаками. Тактика Армии 2, возможно, будет заключаться в применении массовых атак гоблинов и волков для создания хаоса, использовании огров и лордов огров как прорывных сил, дальнобойной поддержке от орков и вождей, а также специализированных атаках от троллей и циклопов для расчистки укреплений или уничтожения ключевых целей. # Выводы и шансы на победу Армия 1 кажется более сбалансированной и вооруженной, с хорошо организованной иерархией и разнообразными единицами для разных задач. Армия 2 включает в себя большое количество существ с высоким физическим потенциалом и уникальными способностями, но они могут страдать от отсутствия координации и общей стратегии. На бумаге, исходя из приведенного анализа, Армия 1 кажется более вероятным победителем из-за ее способности адаптироваться к различным тактикам и маневрам, наличия комбинации боевых и дальнобойных войск, а также благодаря присутствию элитных подразделений типа паладинов и крестоносцев, способных эффективно справляться с большими угрозами. Однако исход любого конфликта будет сильно зависеть от многочисленных факторов, включая территорию битвы, моральный дух, стратегию и элемент случайности."},{"prompt":"Did Randy Gardner ever closed his eyes during the sleep deprivation","completion":"Randy Gardner, known for his 1964 record-breaking experiment of staying awake for 264 hours (about 11 days), did not sleep during his attempt, but it is possible that he might have closed his eyes occasionally to rest them. During sleep deprivation, especially for extended periods, the urge to close one's eyes to rest or relieve strain can be overwhelming, although this action does not equate to sleeping. Closing one's eyes can provide temporary relief from environmental stimuli, which might have been necessary for Gardner to continue his wakefulness. However, the specific details about whether and how often he closed his eyes without falling asleep were not meticulously documented in the available accounts of his feat. It's important to note that throughout the experiment, Gardner was closely observed by Stanford sleep researcher William Dement and his high school friend Bruce McAllister, along with other observers, to ensure that he remained awake. His endeavor was primarily self-monitored, relying heavily on engagement in stimulating activities to combat the severe fatigue and cognitive impairments that ensued. During the experiment, he experienced mood swings, memory and concentration issues, and even hallucinations, but he successfully avoided sleep, according to the records and reports of the event."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

COOL WORLD STREETS - NIGHT The streets of Cool World are bustling with doodles, the neon lights casting surreal shadows. The news of Holli's transformation has created a stir. Panic and curiosity mix in the air. DOODLE CAT, trembling with wide eyes, rushes into a phone booth. DOODLE CAT (panicked) Hello, police! Help! Meanwhile, NAILS, a wiry doodle with an edge of coolness, grabs everything he needs, his face a mask of determination. NAILS Okay...now I understand that nod of Holli's. As Holli and Jack emerge into the streets, they're met with stares of disbelief and awe. HOLLI, taking in her surroundings with new senses, moves with a grace that captivates anyone who looks her way. DOODLE WOLF steps forward, mouth agape, a screech escaping him. DOODLE WOLF Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh! Holli moves through the crowd, an air of finality about her. She approaches DOODLE CAT and DOODLE WOLF, her eyes soft but determined. HOLLI WOULD (gently) I'll miss this madness, but it's time for new adventures. Her farewell is poignant, a surreal bridge between two worlds - the animated and the real. JACK, by her side, finally understands the weight of this moment. As they look back one last time, they see the doodles - confused, scared, but also filled with a sense of wonder. JACK (sincerely) Goodbye, Cool World. Together, they turn their backs on the animated cityscape, venturing into the unknown, leaving a world of doodles to ponder the nature of their own existence.

It also takes place over the ‘separation’ of the political from the economic, that is, over the very existence of the state in its capitalist form. This means that the working-class struggle for economic concessions can be political. People’s fight for concessions in the form of social wage politicizes their economic struggle against private employers: after all, social wage is needed in part because private wage is grossly inadequate. Besides, the coercive forces of the state ‘often take the initiative in lending the economic struggle a political character’ (e.g. when they use force against strikers) (Lenin, 1901). When police suppress strikers, ‘the workers themselves learn to understand whom the government supports’ (ibid.). Workers’ struggle for reforms has two aspects: it is narrowly economic, and it is political. It is economic when workers fight against this or that capitalist. And, here the state intervenes, including sometimes by mediating between capital and labour, and often sending police to crush strikes. Workers’ struggle is political when they push for pro-worker legislations: [T]he movement to force an eight-hour day, etc., law is a political movement. And in this way, out of the separate economic movements of the workers there grows up everywhere a political movement, that is to say a movement of the class, with the object of achieving its interests in a general form, in a form possessing a general social force of compulsion. (Marx, 1871b) When the exploited class struggles against economic exploitation, that struggle, combined with the political struggle in the sense just mentioned, can create conditions for the struggle against the state itself that defends property rights. That is, conditions are created for a higher form of political struggle. The exploited class experiences its ‘exploitation not simply as economic, but as inseparably economic and political, with, for example, the threat of the bailiff and eviction standing behind the landlord’ (Clarke, 1991: 32). Or when during a strike, the working class remains uncompromising and the police arrive or a court order is served making the strike illegal, that reveals the class and political nature of the state. The dominated classes tend to fuse them together in the manner suggested earlier (Clarke, 1991; see also Rothstein, 1990). The relation between struggle for concessions and the actual concessions is, ultimately, a function of a revolutionary threat to the system: ‘We have always said that reforms are a by-product of the revolutionary class struggle’ (Lenin, 1921). So, to the extent that the working class obtains concessions from the state, the durability and magnitude of these concessions are directly related to the extent to which the working class acts in a revolutionary manner. The importance of class struggle also means that irrespective of the state possessing its relative autonomy (which much existing state theory is concerned with), the state will be forced to grant some concessions in response to class struggle in order to, as Marx and Engels (1850) would say, ‘bribe the workers with a more or less disguised form of alms and to break their revolutionary strength by temporarily rendering their situation tolerable’. State autonomy not automatically reproduced In the light of the aforementioned discussion, it can be said that the state’s apparent autonomy from the economic is not automatically reproduced. That is, the separation of workers from means of production, and correspondingly, the apparent separation of the state from the economy, is not a one-time event. This separation is contingent on, and is reproduced in and through, class struggle. Thus, there is a dialectical relation between the state and class struggle. The wage contract between individual worker and capitalist is a very solid reality if the capitalist has the power to enforce that contract, but dissolves into pure illusion if the workers are able to counter-pose their collective power to that of capital. [Similarly] The majesty of the law can inspire awe when it confronts the isolated individual, while becoming an object of ridicule in the face of collective resistance. (Clarke, 1991: 45) This also applies to state workers. Welfare state expansion has created new layers of workers in the public sector whose pay depends on state’s ability to raise taxes. Apart from the struggle between private sector wages and profits that capital has been concerned about, there is now another struggle: the struggle over the sharing of the tax burden and access to public services furnished by these taxes (Schmidt, 2017: 29).52 The four-way struggles over wages, profits, taxes, and welfare provision could trigger inflation and fiscal crises (ibid.) and could reveal to the masses the massive political biases of the state in favour of the tiny capitalist class. Separation of the economic from the political aspects of capitalism by the state The state, like capital, does not give any concession without a struggle. When there is a struggle for concession, the state may give concessions by separating the economic from the political. There are multiple aspects of the state’s response. Firstly, in giving concessions to the people, the state does go against the short-term or long-term interests of individual members of the capitalist class or indeed against certain short-term economic interests of the class as a whole in order to preserve the capitalist class rule. Secondly, the state seeks to enforce the rights of property on the dominated classes individually through the courts, fragmenting collective resistance to the social power of property and ensuring that such power will be imposed on dominated classes individually through the ‘market’, decomposing class forces, and recomposing them as ‘interest groups.’ (Clarke, 1991: 33) so that masses are prevented from struggling as a class. Whenever class struggle tends to overstep the constitutional boundaries of politics and law, and to challenge the rights of property, the state makes economic concessions in an attempt to re-establish the rule of money and law and to restore the separation of the two spheres. Once again, the state action is a form of class struggle from above. Because of the threat from people’s struggles to the immediate economic interests and long-term political interests of the capitalist class, the state, in order to defend capitalist property, resorts to the actual or potential use of violence, which is the single most important obstacle to both struggle for reforms (as evident when police attacks striking workers) and revolutionary struggle. Thirdly, to petty-bourgeoisie and rural popular classes, the state gives con-cessions, including government jobs, which ensure that members of the popular classes are allowed entry into the state (educational institutions, army, and so on) (Poulantzas, 2008: 311—2). It [the state] is, however, only the political culmination of a social system whose other elements include the ideological separation of economics and politics, the creation of a bureaucratic state apparatus which gives large sections of the petty bourgeoisie a material and moral interest in the stability of the state, a bourgeois party system, press, schools’ system, religion, etc. (Lukacs, 2005: 56) The state gives concessions to petty-bourgeois strata ‘in order to set them up as supporting classes of the power bloc and short-circuit their alliance with the working class’ (ibid.: 311). States’ concessions contribute to the depoliticization of the masses and blunting of their class consciousness. Pou- lantzas says that by giving concession even against the interests of capitalists, the state aims precisely at the political disorganization of the dominated classes: the economic concessions help prevent the dominated classes from attacking the political basis of capitalist exploitation, that is, state power itself (Poulantzas, 1968: 188, 1978: 127). This is the case whether or not the state is liberal-democratic. ‘Every minority rule is . . . socially organized both to concentrate the ruling class, equipping it for united and cohesive action, and simultaneously to split and disorganize the oppressed classes’ (Lukacs, 2005: 56). Economic concessions that workers and small-scale producers may gain from the state from time to time help the state and the capitalist class produce consent of the masses to the rule of capital in an economically cheap manner, where possible. They are ‘the cheapest and most advantageous from the government’s point of view, because by these means the state hopes to win the confidence of the working masses’ (Lenin, 1901). The state must take into account some of the interests of the masses — that is, interests in a better existence as workers (and small-scale producers) within capitalism. Of course, the extent to which this happens depends on how well their interests are represented within political parties, state apparatuses, media, academia, and so on. Limits to state’s pro-workers’ action Even if the state gives concessions and sometimes has to do so in order to separate the economic from the political aspects of capitalist class relation, there are strong limits to what it can do for the masses, given its own class character and internal relation to the capitalist class (and its allies). A given policy reflects contradictions among propertied strata and between them and the dominated classes (Poulantzas, 2008: 312), and these contradictions limit how much common people can benefit from state interventions. There is a limit to what these interventions can do to restrict capitalist exploitation of workers (similarly, there is a limit to the extent to which it can protect the relatively less efficient small-scale producers who produce at an individual value that is above the social value, as we have seen). Ill will or good will, more or less, is immaterial/irrelevant. Even if there are philanthropic — or conscious — capitalists, there is a limit to how much the state can help. Capitalist control over property and production, which the state must defend, ultimately leads to the state serving the masses. As Joan Robinson noted: In the present age, any government which had both the power and the will to remedy the major defects of the capitalist system would have the will and the power to abolish it altogether, while governments which have the power to retain the system lack the will to remedy its defects. (quoted in Dowd, 2002: 129) If state’s pro-poor policy enables workers’ significant access to means of subsist-ence in a way that is unmediated by the market, that may reduce the class power of capitalists. The state does not guarantee employment to wage-dependent families, nor does it ensure that small-scale producers receive a price that is needed for their families’ reproduction, and this is the case in spite of the state’s tall promises in the form of, say, minimum-wage and farmers’ legislations. But the state seeks to make sure that capitalists have access to exploitable masses, that they can sell their unsold commodities and that they earn an average rate of profit or, at least, a significant amount of mass of profit.”翻译为中文","completion":"自下而上的阶级斗争与国家形式 阶级斗争不仅仅是围绕政策（例如，一些经济利益——即国家政策的内容）进行的。它还围绕着政治与经济的“分离”展开，即围绕着国家以其资本主义形式的存在本身进行。这意味着，工人阶级争取经济让步的斗争可以是政治性的。人民为社会工资形式的让步而斗争，使他们对私人雇主的经济斗争政治化：毕竟，部分原因是需要社会工资，因为私人工资严重不足。此外，国家的强制力量“经常主动使经济斗争具有政治特征”（例如，当他们对罢工者使用武力时）（列宁，1901）。当警察镇压罢工者时，“工人们自己就会明白政府支持谁”（同上）。工人争取改革的斗争有两个方面：它是狭隘的经济性的，也是政治性的。当工人反对这个或那个资本家时，它是经济性的。而在这里，国家介入，包括有时在资本和劳动之间进行调解，经常派遣警察来镇压罢工。工人的斗争是政治性的，当他们推动亲工人的立法时： “迫使通过八小时工作日等法律的运动是一场政治运动。通过这种方式，工人们的单独经济运动无处不在地发展成为政治运动，也就是说，以一个类别的形式，为了以一种具有普遍社会强制力的形式实现其利益的运动。” （马克思，1871b） 当被剥削阶级反对经济剥削时，这种斗争与刚才提到的政治斗争相结合，可以为反对保护财产权的国家本身的斗争创造条件。也就是说，为更高形式的政治斗争创造条件。被剥削阶级体验到的“剥削不仅仅是经济性的，而是经济性和政治性不可分割的，例如，地主背后站着的是法警和驱逐的威胁”（克拉克，1991：32）。或者当在罢工期间，工人阶级保持不妥协，警察到来或法庭下达命令使罢工非法时，这揭示了国家的阶级和政治性质。被统治阶级倾向于以前面提到的方式将它们融合在一起（克拉克，1991；另见罗斯特恩，1990）。 争取让步与实际让步之间的关系，最终是对体制的革命性威胁的一个功能：“我们总是说，改革是革命阶级斗争的副产品”（列宁，1921）。因此，工人阶级从国家获得让步的程度与工人阶级以革命性方式行动的程度直接相关。阶级斗争的重要性也意味着，尽管现有的国家理论关注于国家拥有其相对的自主性，国家将被迫为了响应阶级斗争而做出一些让步，正如马克思和恩格斯（1850）所说，“以一种或多或少伪装的施舍形式贿赂工人们，并通过暂时使他们的处境变得可忍受来破坏他们的革命力量”。 国家自主性并非自动再生产 根据前面的讨论，可以说，国家表面上脱离经济的自主性并非自动再生产的。也就是说，将工人与生产资料的分离，以及相应的，国家与经济的表面分离，不是一次性事件。这种分离是以阶级斗争为前提的，并且是通过阶级斗争再生产的。因此，国家与阶级斗争之间存在辩证关系。 如果资本家有权力执行合同，那么个别工人与资本家之间的工资合同是非常坚实的现实；但如果工人能够将他们的集体力量与资本的力量相对抗，它就会溶解成纯粹的幻觉。【同样】当对抗孤立的个体时，法律的庄严可以激发敬畏，但面对集体抵抗时，则成为笑柄。 （克拉克，1991：45） 这同样适用于国家工人。福利国家的扩张在公共部门创造了新的工人层次，他们的薪酬取决于国家征税的能力。除了资本一直关心的私营部门工资与利润之间的斗争外，现在还有另一场斗争：税收负担分担和通过这些税收提供的公共服务获取的斗争（施密特，2017：29）。这四方面的斗争可能引发通货膨胀和财政危机（同上），并可能向大众揭示国家在支持微小的资本家阶层方面具有巨大的政治偏见。 国家通过分离经济与政治方面的资本主义 国家和资本一样，不会在没有斗争的情况下给予任何让步。当存在争取让步的斗争时，国家可能通过分离经济与政治给予让步。国家的回应有多个方面。 首先，为了向人民给予让步，国家确实会违背资本家阶层个别成员的短期或长期利益，甚至有时会违背整个阶级的某些短期经济利益，以保护资本家阶级统治。 其次， 国家通过法院对被统治阶级个体强制执行财产权，分裂集体对财产社会权力的抵抗，并确保这种权力将通过“市场”个别地强加于被统治阶级，分解阶级力量，将其重组为“利益集团”。 （克拉克，1991：33） 以防止大众以一个阶级的身份进行斗争。每当阶级斗争趋于超越政治和法律的宪法边界，并挑战财产权时，国家就会通过经济让步来试图重新建立金钱和法律的统治，并恢复这两个领域的分离。再次，国家的行动是一种自上而下的阶级斗争。 由于人民斗争对资本家阶级的直接经济利益和长期政治利益的威胁，国家为了保卫资本主义财产，会诉诸实际或潜在的使用暴力，这是对改革斗争（如当警察攻击罢工工人时）和革命斗争的最重要障碍之一。 第三，对小资产阶级和农村人民阶层，国家给予让步，包括政府工作，确保这些阶级的成员被允许进入国家（教育机构、军队等）（普朗查斯，2008：311-2）。 国家是社会制度的政治高峰，其它元素包括经济和政治的意识形态分离、创造一个官僚国家机构，使大部分小资产阶级在物质和道德上对国家的稳定感兴趣，一个资产阶级的政党系统、新闻媒体、学校系统、宗教等。 （卢卡奇，2005：56） 国家给予小资产阶级阶段的让步“是为了将他们作为权力集团的支持阶级，并阻断他们与工人阶级的联盟”（同上：311）。国家的让步有助于对大众的去政治化和削弱他们的阶级意识。普朗查斯说，通过给予让步，即使是违背资本家的利益，目的正是为了政治性地解组被统治阶级：经济让步有助于防止被统治阶级攻击资本主义剥削的政治基础，即国家权力本身（普朗查斯，1968：188，1978：127）。无论国家是否是自由民主的，情况都是这样。“每一个少数统治都是...社会上组织起来，既要集中统治阶级，让其装备起来进行团结和有力的行动，同时也要分裂和解组被压迫阶级”（卢卡奇，2005：56）。 工人和小规模生产者可能不时从国家获得的经济让步有助于国家和资本家阶级以一种经济上便宜的方式获得大众对资本统治的同意，如果可能的话。这些是“从政府的角度看来最便宜和最有利的，因为通过这些手段，国家希望赢得工人群众的信任”（列宁，1901）。国家必须考虑到大众的一些利益——即作为工人（和小规模生产者）在资本主义内部更好的生存利益。当然，这在多大程度上发生取决于他们的利益在政党、国家机构、媒体、学术界等方面的代表程度。 国家亲工人行动的限制 即使国家给予让步，有时为了分离资本主义阶级关系的经济与政治方面而必须这样做，鉴于其自身的阶级特性和与资本家阶级（及其盟友）的内在关系，它为大众所能做的有着强烈的限制。一个特定的政策反映了财产阶层之间以及它们与被统治阶级之间的矛盾（普朗查斯，2008：312），这些矛盾限制了普通人可以从国家干预中获益的程度。 这些干预在限制资本家对工人的剥削（类似地，它在保护那些生产出的个别价值高于社会价值的相对效率较低的小规模生产者方面能做的也有限，正如我们所看到的）方面能做到的有限。善意或恶意，多或少，是无关紧要的。即使有慈善的——或有意识的——资本家，国家能帮助的也是有限的。资本家对财产和生产的控制，国家必须捍卫，最终导致国家服务于大众。正如琼·罗宾逊所指出的： 在当今时代，任何既有能力又有意愿纠正资本主义系统主要缺陷的政府都将有意愿和能力彻底废除它，而有能力保留该系统的政府缺乏纠正其缺陷的意愿。 （引自多德，2002：129） 如果国家的亲穷人政策能够以一种不通过市场中介的方式显著增加工人对生存手段的获取，那么可能会减少资本家的阶级力量。国家不保证给依赖工资的家庭提供就业机会，也不确保小规模生产者获得其家庭繁衍所需的价格，尽管国家在最低工资和农民立法等形式上做出了宏大的承诺。但国家力求确保资本家能够获得可剥削的大众，他们可以销售他们的未售商品，并且他们赚取平均利润率或者至少是大量的利润。"},{"prompt":"请将“The interests of capitalists and those of masses are fundamentally incompatible. Significant and durable improvements in their conditions of living and working cannot happen because they do not control either society’s major means of production or the coercive power of the state. Without the state’s coercive power over the working class, the control over the economy will not be in the hands of the capitalist class. [T]here can be no discussion of systematic social reforms and the raising of the masses’ living standards; when every serious demand of the proletariat and even every serious demand of the petty bourgeoisie inevitably reaches beyond the limits of capitalist property relations and of the bourgeois state. (Trotsky, 1938a) As mentioned, the state has sought to improve the conditions of common people. Yet it is the case that the state fails to meet their need in a significant and durable manner. This failure is actually the state’s success in keeping the masses in their place. Its failure is internally connected to what the state is. In relation to the working class, the state falls short in two major ways (Figure 9.3). Surplus value ultimately comes from the deduction of the value of labour power from the total net value produced by the worker. State’s proworker laws can only aim to make sure that workers get back at least as much as it takes to reproduce their labour power, that there are enough workers with adequate physical ability and skills, available for exploitation by the employer, that is, that ‘the worker has retained his labour-power and can sell it anew if he can find a buyer’ (Marx, 1887: 413).53 This means that the state’s pro-worker laws can only be against excesses of capitalism. This constitutes the lower limit of state action. State laws cannot be fundamentally against the capitalist property relations, by virtue of which the excesses exist. Even then, the state falls short: it fails to eliminate the excesses, because it must meet the needs of capital. A capitalist class in a society without millions of people who are already in (near-)poverty and/or face the risk of being in poverty, would be a class without its necessary political guarantee too. This is because it would face a situation where those who are not poor (e.g. well-paid workers) would have a lot of bargaining power, which, in turn, would increase the bargaining power of those who are poor, and therefore, of all sections of the exploited class. The state could ensure that workers receive the entire value of what they pro-duce minus the usual deductions necessary for meeting society-wide needs.54 But the state does not and cannot, because it is the state of the capitalist class and not the workers and small-scale producers. There are ‘layers’ of the logic of state’s limited success in improving the conditions of the masses. During normal times, the imperative of capitalist accumulation sets a limit on what the state can do for workers: as soon as the amount of total value of society that goes to the hands of the masses adversely affects the amount of the average rate of surplus value to be appropriated by the capitalist class, there will generally be a stop to any further improvement. When we consider the geographical mobility as an aspect of accumulation, we see that it imposes a further layer of constraint on what the state can do for workers. Finally, the crisis-proneness of capitalist accumulation, and indeed the fact that capitalism is in its relative terminal decline stage, with the productive forces retarded, constrains how much concession the masses can receive from the state. In relation to the decline stage of capitalism, imperialism (that is, capitalism at the world-scale) is a crucial process: Imperialist capitalism is no longer capable of developing the productive forces of humanity. For this reason it can grant the workers neither material concessions nor effective social reforms. (Trotsky, 1937) In spite of many limits, the working class does receive the positive results of its struggle in specific sectors and regions: All this is correct. But it is only correct on the scale of an entire epoch. There are branches of industry . . . with prodigious force . . . Moreover, this decrepit economy has its ebbs and flows. The workers are almost continually passing from one struggle to another, and sometimes they are victorious. (Trotsky, 1937) But that does not mean that the general tendency — that there are limits to what the workers can get — is nullified. Trotsky adds: ‘Of course, capitalism takes from the workers with its right hand what it has given them with its left’ (ibid.). In other words, there are limits to what the state can do for the masses and win consent through material concessions. If this is the case, then it follows that apart from consent production by means of ideological deception, methods of coercive action (actual and/or threatened), the methods that are heavily under-stressed in existing theory, are other ways in which the state maintains the capitalist class rule. 5 Summary, and theoretical and political implications One implication of the class character of the state is that apart from the state having to meet the fundamental needs of the capitalist class, it must also respond to the struggle of the masses for concessions. We have seen that the masses get little without a fight and that there is a limit to how much they can get even with a fight, especially during the imperialist stage dominated by world monopolies, associated with the relative decline in the development of productive forces. It is also the case that to obtain some concessions, trade unions have to often support — or they have to make sure they do not undermine conditions for — national- and regional-level capitalist accumulation. The fact that capitalist investment in many sectors can move across state’s territorial jurisdictions at national and sub-national scales imposes a limit on workers’ receiving significant concessions. All these facts together have specific political implications. One is that trade union struggle is not un-important in spite of these facts: [I]n spite of the progressive degeneration of trade unions . . . , the work within the trade unions not only does not lose any of its importance but remains as before and becomes in a certain sense even more important work than ever for every revolutionary party. The matter at issue is essentially the struggle for influence over the working class [including communist caucuses within trade unions]. (Trotsky, 1940) Therefore, Every organization, every party, every faction which permits itself an ulti- matistic position in relation to the trade union, i.e., in essence turns its back upon the working class, merely because of displeasure with its organizations, every such organization is destined to perish. And it must be said it deserves to perish. (ibid.) Althusser (2001: 54) notes: Marx . . . proves irrefutably that the working class cannot hope to gain from the modern growth of productivity before it has overthrown capitalism and seized State power in a socialist revolution. He proves that from here to the revolutionary seizure of power which opens the road to socialism, the working class can have no other objective, and hence no other resource, than to struggle against the effects of exploitation produced by the growth of productivity, in order to limit these effects (struggle against speed-up, against arbitrary productivity bonuses, against overtime, against redundancies, against ‘automation unemployment’). All in all, the state and the capitalist economic system cannot meet the needs of the people, and pro-worker interventions are only a ‘meagre concession wrung from capital’ (Marx, 1887: 319). The political aim of the proletarian movement therefore must be, as Marx, Engels, Lenin, Luxemburg, and Trotsky have said, ‘the conquest of power by the proletariat for the purpose of expropriating the bourgeoisie’ (Trotsky, 1938a). The ultimate aim of the labour movement is not to continue to fight merely for better conditions under which people can sell their labour power but to abolish the conditions for such sale, that is, to abolish wage labour itself, and this cannot be done without overthrowing the state that defends wage labour: The political movement of the working class has as its object, of course, the conquest of political power for the working class, and for this it is naturally necessary that a previous organisation of the working class, itself arising from their economic struggles, should have been developed up to a certain point. (Marx, 1871b) Where the working class is not yet far enough advanced in its organisation to undertake a decisive campaign against the collective power, i.e., the political power of the ruling classes, it must at any rate be trained for this by continual agitation against and a hostile attitude towards the policy of the ruling classes. (ibid.) It would indeed be mistaken to ignore/under-stress ‘the organisation of the working class as a class through the medium of trade unions’ even if unions fight for concessions only, because through the unions the proletariat ‘fights its daily battles with capital, in which it trains itself’ (Engels in Marx and Engels, 1975: 275). The struggle for economic and political reforms is important, not only because some concessions may be obtained which can improve the desperate conditions of the masses temporarily. An improvement in the conditions of the masses might also facilitate further struggle: it is easier for literate and healthier people living in cities and in villages well connected with modern means of communication, enjoying a certain amount of democratic rights, to struggle for self-emancipation, than for the illiterate, hungry, and ill people living in areas without any means of communication or culture or democratic rights. Also, the fighting for economic and political concessions can lead the masses to discover the limits, through practice, to what the state can actually do to help the masses, and therefore the real classpolitical nature of the state, which falsely represents itself as the state of and for everyone. Marx indeed says that if Marxism denies the importance of such struggles, then ‘what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist’ (Marx and Guesde, 1880). Fighting for economic and political reforms under appropriate conditions (e.g. education about theory and history of the working-class movement and capitalism) can have a positive effect on worker’s political capacity. But workers cannot fight only for economic concessions. If there are limits to the state’s concessions, there are limits to the struggles that are only for con-cessions from the state. As we have seen, through economic concessions the state ‘hopes to win the confidence of the working masses’ (Lenin, 1901). ‘For this very reason’, communists ‘must not under any circumstances or in any way whatever create grounds for the belief (or the misunderstanding) that we attach greater value to economic reforms, or that we regard them as being particularly important, etc.’ (ibid.).”翻译为中文","completion":"资本家的利益与大众的利益根本不相容。由于他们既不控制社会的主要生产资料，也不控制国家的强制力量，他们的生活和工作条件无法实现重大和持久的改善。如果没有国家对工人阶级的强制力量，经济的控制权将不会掌握在资本家阶级手中。 “不可能讨论系统性的社会改革和提高大众生活水平；当无产阶级的每一个严肃要求乃至小资产阶级的每一个严肃要求都不可避免地超出了资本主义财产关系和资产阶级国家的限制时。” （托洛茨基，1938a） 如前所述，国家试图改善普通人的条件。但实际上，国家未能以重大和持久的方式满足他们的需求。这种失败实际上是国家在保持大众处于原位的成功中的一部分。其失败与国家本身的性质内在相关。 就工人阶级而言，国家在两个主要方面不足（图9.3）。剩余价值最终来源于从工人所生产的总净值中扣除劳动力的价值。国家亲工人的法律只能确保工人至少能够获得足以再生产他们劳动力所需的回报，有足够的具有适当体能和技能的工人可供雇主利用，即“工人保留了他的劳动力并且可以再次出售，如果他能找到买家的话”（马克思，1887：413）。这意味着，国家的亲工人法律只能针对资本主义的过度行为。这构成了国家行动的下限。国家法律不能根本反对资本主义的财产关系，这些过度行为正是基于这些关系而存在的。即便如此，国家仍然不足：它未能消除这些过度行为，因为它必须满足资本的需求。一个没有数以百万计已经处于（近）贫困状态和/或面临贫困风险的人的社会，对于资本家阶级而言，也将失去其必要的政治保证。这是因为，它将面临那些不贫穷的人（例如，薪水丰厚的工人）将拥有大量议价能力的情况，这反过来将增加贫穷者的议价能力，因此，增加所有被剥削阶级部分的议价能力。 国家可以确保工人获得他们生产的全部价值减去为满足社会广泛需求而必需的通常扣除。但国家不这样做，也不能这样做，因为它是资本家阶级而不是工人和小规模生产者的国家。 国家在提高大众条件方面的有限成功存在“层次”逻辑。在正常时期，资本家积累的必要性为国家能为工人做的事情设定了限制：一旦社会总价值中流向大众的部分不利地影响了资本家阶级预期的平均剩余价值率，任何进一步的改善通常都会停止。当我们考虑地理流动性作为积累的一个方面时，我们看到它对国家能为工人做的事情施加了进一步的限制。最后，资本积累的危机倾向，实际上是资本主义相对衰退阶段的事实，以及生产力的发展受阻，限制了大众能从国家获得多少让步。就资本主义的衰退阶段而言，帝国主义（即世界范围内的资本主义）是一个关键过程： “帝国主义资本主义不再有能力发展人类的生产力。因此，它既不能给工人以物质让步，也不能实施有效的社会改革。” （托洛茨基，1937） 尽管有许多限制，工人阶级确实在特定的行业和地区收获了其斗争的积极成果： “这一切都是正确的。但它只有在整个时代的尺度上才是正确的。 有一些行业...以惊人的力量...此外，这个衰落的经济有其潮起潮落。工人几乎持续地从一场斗争转向另一场斗争，有时他们是胜利的。” （托洛茨基，1937） 但这并不意味着工人能获得的东西是有限的这一总体趋势被否定了。托洛茨基补充说：“当然，资本主义用右手拿走了它用左手给工人的东西”（同上）。换句话说，国家能为大众做的事情有限，并通过物质让步赢得同意也有限。如果情况确实如此，那么就可以推断，除了通过意识形态欺骗产生同意之外，强制行动的方法（实际的和/或威胁的），这些方法在现有理论中被严重忽视，是国家维持资本家阶级统治的其他方式。 5 总结，理论和政治含义 国家具有阶级性质的一个含义是，除了必须满足资本家阶级的基本需求外，它还必须响应大众争取让步的斗争。我们已经看到，没有斗争，大众几乎得不到什么，即使有斗争，他们能得到的也是有限的，特别是在由世界垄断主导的帝国主义阶段，与生产力的相对衰退发展相关。还有一个事实是，为了获得一些让步，工会往往不得不支持——或他们必须确保不破坏——国家和地区层面的资本积累条件。资本家投资可以在国家和次国家层面的领土管辖范围内流动，这限制了工人获得重大让步的可能性。所有这些事实加在一起有特定的政治含义。一个是，尽管有这些事实，工会斗争并非不重要： “尽管工会日渐衰退...，在工会内部的工作不仅没有失去任何重要性，而且像以前一样，甚至在某种意义上比以往任何时候都更重要，对于每一个革命党来说。本质上，争议是关于对工人阶级的影响力的斗争[包括工会内的共产主义核心团队]。” （托洛茨基，1940） 因此， “任何组织、任何政党、任何派别，如果它对工会采取极端主义立场，即实质上是因为对其组织不满而背离工人阶级，每一个这样的组织都注定要灭亡。而且必须说，它理应灭亡。” （同上） 阿尔都塞（2001：54）指出： “马克思...无可辩驳地证明，在没有推翻资本主义并通过社会主义革命夺取国家权力之前，工人阶级不可能从现代生产力的增长中获益。他证明，从这里到革命性地夺取权力，为社会主义开辟道路，工人阶级别无选择，因此也没有其他资源，只能是为了限制生产力增长所产生的剥削效应（对加速度的斗争，对任意生产力奖金的斗争，对加班的斗争，对裁员的斗争，对“自动化失业”的斗争）而进行斗争。” 总而言之，国家和资本主义经济体系不能满足人民的需求，亲工人的干预只是“从资本中榨取的微薄让步”（马克思，1887：319）。因此，无产阶级运动的政治目标必须是，如马克思、恩格斯、列宁、卢森堡和托洛茨基所说的，“为了没收资产阶级而由无产阶级夺取权力”（托洛茨基，1938a）。劳动运动的最终目标不是仅为了改善人们出卖劳动力的条件而继续斗争，而是废除这种出售的条件，即废除雇佣劳动本身，而这不可能在不推翻捍卫雇佣劳动的国家的情况下完成： “工人阶级的政治运动当然以为工人阶级夺取政治权力为目标，为此自然需要工人阶级从其经济斗争中产生的先前组织已发展到一定程度。” （马克思，1871b） “在工人阶级还没有在其组织上足够先进，无法对抗集体力量，即统治阶级的政治力量，发起决定性的斗争时，它必须通过不断的对统治阶级政策的抗议和敌对态度来为此训练自己。” （同上） 确实，即使工会只为让步而斗争，也忽视/低估通过工会作为工人阶级通过工会组织成为一个阶级将是错误的，因为通过工会，无产阶级“与资本进行日常战斗，在这个过程中它训练自己”（恩格斯在马克思和恩格斯，1975：275）。 争取经济和政治改革是重要的，不仅因为可以获得一些可能暂时改善大众绝望条件的让步。大众条件的改善也可能促进进一步的斗争：对识字并且更健康的人们来说，生活在城市和与现代通信手段连接良好的村庄，享有一定数量的民主权利，比对生活在没有任何通信或文化或民主权利的地区的文盲、饥饿和疾病缠身的人来说，争取自我解放更容易。此外，争取经济和政治让步可以让大众通过实践发现国家实际能为大众做什么的限制，因此认识到国家的真实阶级政治性质，这种性质错误地将自己描述为为所有人和所有人的国家。马克思确实说，如果马克思主义否认这类斗争的重要性，那么“可以肯定的是，我自己不是马克思主义者”（马克思和盖斯德，1880）。在适当条件下（例如，关于工人阶级运动和资本主义的理论和历史教育）为经济和政治改革而战，可以对工人的政治能力产生积极影响。 但工人不能仅为经济让步而斗争。如果国家的让步是有限的，那么仅仅为了从国家获得让步的斗争也是有限的。正如我们所见，通过经济让步，国家“希望赢得工人群众的信任”（列宁，1901）。 “正因为如此”，共产主义者“在任何情况下或以任何方式都绝不能为人们制造这样的信念（或误解），即我们更重视经济改革，或我们认为它们特别重要等。”（同上）。"},{"prompt":"请将“If the state seeks to disorganize the working class, the working class must try ‘to counteract this process of disorganization. It must first of all constitute itself as a class’ (Lukacs, 2005: 57). And the working class must be conscious of the following fact: if the increased access to use-values via a rise in wages from employers can, at best, lead to a relaxation of the golden chain around the neck of the working class, so increased public wage in the form of government benefits can only have a similar effect as long as the working class has no direct control over the means of production and over the very purpose of production of wealth (satisfaction of human needs versus profit for a few) and over how the state works. Such control cannot occur without the masses creating their own transitional state, after replacing the current state. The fusion of economic and political struggle should neither be shaped by mere spontaneity nor by the desire to obtain more concessions. It has to be based on class consciousness, which, in its fully developed form, is the idea that capitalist interests and masses’ interest are fundamentally incompatible, and that this incompatibility cannot be abolished until the capitalist state is overthrown. It is true that in mobilizing workers for reforms, trade unions often lose their independence vis-à-vis the capitalist state, especially during the imperialist stage. But: Does this mean that in the epoch of imperialism independent trade unions are generally impossible? It would be fundamentally incorrect to pose the question this way. Impossible are the independent or semi-independent reformist trade unions. Wholly possible are revolutionary trade unions which not only are not stockholders of imperialist policy but which set as their task the direct overthrow of the rule of capitalism. (Trotsky, 1940)55 Trade unions (and other organizations of the masses such as factory committees) must remain independent of the state (and of bourgeois parties) to play a revolutionary role. For this to happen, they need to employ democratic slogans (e.g. right to unionize) and combine them with the transitional demands as well as minimum economic demands (e.g. a rise in wages). In the epoch of imperialist decay the trade unions can be really independent only to the extent that they are conscious of being, in action, the organs of proletarian revolution. In this sense, the program of transitional demands . . . in its fundamental features is the program for the activity of the trade unions [and not just for that of the communist political movement]. (Trotsky, 1940) Transitional demands are of a different type than the usual trade union (or partial) demand such as a rise in money wages which the system can accommodate. Transitional demands include housing for all, indexed wages (‘an automatic rise in wages in relation to the increase in price of consumer goods’), and the right to employment, including on public works (Trotsky, 1938a). The essence of transitional demands ‘is contained in the fact that ever more openly and decisively they will be directed against the very bases of the bourgeois regime’ (ibid.). Transitional demands are those that stem ‘from today’s conditions and from today’s consciousness of wide layers of the working class and unalterably leading to one final conclusion: the conquest of power by the proletariat’ (ibid.). The need for transitional demand is to be connected to a need for solidarity across the social-cultural divides within the working class. Concessions are granted partly because workers struggle for them. However, racial and other divisions undermine workers’ unity; the state, including the bourgeois parties, promotes such division and non-class identities. So the fight against racial oppression and the efforts to create racial unity must be parts of people’s struggle against capital, including that which demands concessions. Marx (1887: 195) was aware of the matter: ‘In the United States of North America, every independent movement of the workers was paralysed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the Republic. Labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded’ (ibid.). Besides, there is a need for solidarity between currently employed workers and unemployed workers in cities, and between all of them and small-scale producers. Workers’ successful struggle for concessions points to a possibility of a society beyond capitalism: Though the Factory Act, that first and meagre concession wrung from capital, is limited to combining elementary education with work in the factory, there can be no doubt that when the working-class comes into power, as inevitably it must, technical instruction, both theoretical and practical, will take its proper place in the working-class schools. There is also no doubt that such revolutionary ferments, the final result of which is the abolition of the old division of labour, are diametrically opposed to the capitalistic form of production, and to the economic status of the labourer corresponding to that form. (Marx, 1887: 319) Capital volume 1 not only reveals the economic laws of motion of capitalism but also sheds light on the conditions for, and the barriers to, the development of the working class. Capitalists’ ‘own most important interests dictate’ that ‘all legally removable hindrances’ (e.g. the crippling of the quality of labour power due to overwork) ‘to the free development of the working class’ be removed. Partly for this reason, Marx (1887: 7) says, he gives ‘so large a space in this volume to the history, the details, and the results of English factory legislation’. And this is why it is important to re-examine Marx’s discussion of the workplace legislation and to reflect on what the state does for the workers’ welfare. The state has given concessions improving the health and education of the workers. What this means is that to the extent that capitalism, in its own interest, creates an educated workforce, such a workforce is also being trained to manage the affairs of society on their own without the interference of capitalists or bureaucratic state actors. Capitalism not only matures the material conditions (e.g. large-scale production, technical improvements, and so one), that are partly spurred on by the pro-worker action, for socialism. It also matures various contradictions inside it. These contradictions are economic, which are expressed in the form of periodic crises, prompting state action. These contradictions are also political: contradictions between (a) the image that the state is for all and (b) the reality of its structurally inscribed inherent ‘biases’ in favour of the propertied classes. Given these contradictions, a new force is created that can, under proper conditions, overthrow the state along with the capitalist property relation that it defends, and begin to create a new society by utilizing the conditions already maturing under capitalism: By maturing the material conditions, and the combination on a social scale of the processes of production, it [pro-worker state intervention] matures the contradictions and antagonisms of the capitalist form of production, and thereby provides, along with the elements for the formation of a new society, the forces for exploding the old one. 10 State forms Geographic and bureaucratic The distinction between form and content is very important to Marx’s historical materialist method. He criticizes in Capital 1, ‘The bourgeois economist whose narrow mind is unable to separate the form of appearance from the thing that appears’ (Marx, 1887: 402). In his preface to the first German edition of Capital 1, Marx says that ‘in bourgeois society, the commodity-form of the product of labour — or value-form of the commodity — is the economic cell-form’ (p. 6). In fact, and as mentioned earlier, Marx begins his Capital 1 by saying that while all societies need wealth (use-values), in capitalism, wealth takes the form of commodities. He says: ‘Use values . . . constitute the substance [content] of all wealth, whatever may be the social form of that wealth’ (p. 27).1 The form-content distinction, an important aspect of Marx’s dialectical method (see Chapter 1), has been used in this book to distinguish between class society and capitalist form of class society, and to distinguish between class-state and the capitalist form of it.2 In this chapter, I use ‘state form’ not at the level of class society (i.e. state form in terms of feudal state or capitalist state) but at the level of a particular class society, that is, capitalist class society. In relation to the capitalist state, I use ‘state form’ in the following sense: all capitalist states have geographical and bureaucratic forms in terms of their internal structure (this means that the content of state-society relations takes geographical and bureaucratic forms), and these forms serve capitalist accumulation, but can also problematize that process. While the state is a social relation/process, like all social relations/ processes, it has a geographical (spatial and scalar) form. While the state is a relation/process of class domination, this mechanism of class domination is effected through its specific form. So, form, in this chapter, refers to particular expressions of a given content, or to the mechanisms through which a structure of relations actually operates. In other words, the term/concept ‘form’ will be used less in the historical sense and more in the ‘substantive’ sense. The claim that the capitalist state is a form of class-state employs the form-content distinction historically. The claim that the capitalist state has geographical form and bureaucratic form applies to all historical phases of the capitalist state. But there is a common ground between Marx’s use of form in the historical sense and the way form is used in the chapter: what is referred to as form is more concrete than the object of whose form is in question. This is in the follow-ing specific sense: while all capitalist states serve the capitalist class, their particular geographical forms and the extent to which they are bureaucratic will vary. While social relations/processes/objects necessarily have spatial forms, the actual causal significance of the latter will depend on the processes/relations/ objects in question (Sayer, 1985). And, in terms of causal priority, it is the social relations and, more specifically, class relations that have priority over their spatial forms (Das, 2017b). In Section 1, I discuss the geographical form of the state, including the scale division of labour within the state between more local and more central branches of the state. The local branches of the state are said to be more accessible to common people. Section 2 discusses the bureaucratic form — the question of bureaucratism and how the latter is a form of domination over common people.”翻译为中文","completion":"如果国家寻求瓦解工人阶级，工人阶级必须尝试“对抗这种瓦解过程。首先，它必须将自己构建为一个阶级”（卢卡奇，2005：57）。工人阶级必须意识到以下事实：通过提高工资来增加使用价值的获取，顶多可能缓解工人阶级脖子上的金链，同样，只要工人阶级对生产资料没有直接控制，对财富生产的真正目的（满足人类需求与为少数人盈利）和国家的运作方式没有直接控制，以政府福利形式增加的公共工资也只能产生类似效果。在取代现有国家后，没有大众创造自己的过渡性国家，就无法实现这种控制。经济和政治斗争的融合既不应该被纯粹的自发性塑造，也不应该被获取更多让步的愿望塑造。它必须基于阶级意识，这种意识在其完全发展的形式中，是资本家利益与大众利益根本不相容的思想，这种不相容性在资本主义国家被推翻之前无法消除。 确实，在为改革动员工人时，工会常常会失去对资本主义国家的独立性，特别是在帝国主义阶段。但是： 这是否意味着在帝国主义时代独立的工会一般是不可能的？以这种方式提出问题将是根本错误的。独立或半独立的改革主义工会是不可能的。完全可能的是革命性工会，这些工会不仅不是帝国主义政策的股东，而且设定了直接推翻资本主义统治的任务为自己的任务。 （托洛茨基，1940） 工会（以及其他大众组织，如工厂委员会）必须保持独立于国家（和资产阶级政党），以发挥革命性作用。为此，他们需要采用民主口号（例如，成立工会的权利）并将其与过渡性要求以及最低经济要求（例如，提高工资）结合起来。 在帝国主义衰退时代，工会只有在意识到自己在行动中是无产阶级革命的工具这一点上，才能真正独立。在这个意义上，过渡性要求的计划...在其基本特征上是工会活动的计划[不仅仅是共产主义政治运动的计划]。 （托洛茨基，1940） 过渡性要求与通常的工会（或部分）要求（例如提高货币工资）不同，后者是系统可以容纳的。过渡性要求包括为所有人提供住房，工资挂钩（“消费品价格上涨时自动提高工资”），以及就业权，包括公共工程上的就业（托洛茨基，1938a）。过渡性要求的本质“在于它们越来越公开和果断地针对资产阶级制度的基础”（同上）。过渡性要求是那些“基于当今条件和广大工人阶级当前意识的要求，不可改变地导向一个最终结论：无产阶级夺取权力”（同上）。 过渡性要求的需要与跨越工人阶级内部的社会文化分歧的团结需求联系在一起。部分原因是工人为之斗争而获得的让步。然而，种族和其他分歧破坏了工人的团结；国家，包括资产阶级政党，促进了这种分裂和非阶级身份。因此，反对种族压迫的斗争和创造种族团结的努力必须是人们反对资本的斗争的一部分，包括要求让步的斗争。马克思（1887：195）意识到了这个问题：“在北美合众国，只要奴隶制玷污了共和国的一部分，工人的每一个独立运动就被瘫痪了。在黑人被烙印的地方，劳动在白人皮肤中不能解放自己”（同上）。此外，有必要在当前就业的工人和失业工人之间、以及他们与小规模生产者之间建立团结。 工人成功争取让步的斗争指向了一个超越资本主义的可能社会： 虽然《工厂法案》是从资本中榨取的第一个也是微薄的让步，限于将初等教育与工厂工作相结合，但毫无疑问，当工人阶级掌握权力，这是必然的，技术教育，无论是理论上的还是实践上的，都将在工人阶级学校中占据其应有的位置。同样毫无疑问，这种革命性的发酵，其最终结果是废除旧的劳动分工，与资本主义生产形式和与该形式相对应的劳动者经济地位背道而驰。 （马克思，1887：319） 《资本论》第一卷不仅揭示了资本主义的经济运动规律，也阐明了工人阶级发展的条件和障碍。资本家“自己最重要的利益要求”消除“一切合法可移除的障碍”（例如，由于过度劳动导致劳动力质量受损），“以促进工人阶级的自由发展”。部分因此，马克思（1887：7）说，他在本卷中给予英国工厂立法的历史、细节和结果“如此大的篇幅”。这就是为什么重新审视马克思关于工作场所立法的讨论，并反思国家为工人福利所做的事情很重要。 国家给予了改善工人健康和教育的让步。这意味着，在资本主义自身利益创造受过教育的劳动力的程度上，这样的劳动力也在被训练为在没有资本家或官僚国家行为者干预的情况下自行管理社会事务。资本主义不仅成熟了物质条件（例如，大规模生产、技术改进等），这些部分上是由亲工人行动推动的，为社会主义做准备。它还成熟了资本主义内部的各种矛盾。这些矛盾是经济上的，以周期性危机的形式表现出来，促使国家采取行动。这些矛盾也是政治上的：（a）国家是为所有人服务的形象与（b）其结构性内在“偏见”有利于有产阶级的现实之间的矛盾。鉴于这些矛盾，一个新的力量被创造出来，在适当的条件下，可以推翻国家及其捍卫的资本主义财产关系，并开始利用在资本主义下已经成熟的条件创造一个新社会： 通过成熟的物质条件和生产过程的社会规模组合，[亲工人的国家干预]成熟了资本主义生产形式的矛盾和对立，并因此提供了形成新社会的要素，以及爆炸旧社会的力量。 10 国家形式 地理和官僚 形式与内容的区别对马克思的历史唯物主义方法非常重要。他在《资本论》第一卷中批评了“那些狭隘头脑的资产阶级经济学家，他们无法将现象的形式与出现的事物分开”（马克思，1887：402）。在《资本论》第一卷的德文版序言中，马克思说，“在资产阶级社会中，劳动产品的商品形式——或商品的价值形式——是经济细胞形式”（第6页）。事实上，正如之前提到的，马克思在《资本论》第一卷开始时说，虽然所有社会都需要财富（使用价值），在资本主义中，财富以商品的形式出现。他说：“使用价值...构成一切财富的实质[内容]，无论该财富的社会形式是什么”（第27页）。形式-内容区别，马克思辩证法重要方面（见第1章），已在本书中用来区分阶级社会与资本主义形式的阶级社会，以及区分阶级国家与资本主义形式的阶级国家。 在本章中，我使用“国家形式”不是在阶级社会的层面上（即国家形式就封建国家或资本主义国家而言），而是在特定阶级社会的层面上，即资本主义阶级社会。就资本主义国家而言，我以以下意义使用“国家形式”：所有资本主义国家在其内部结构上都具有地理和官僚形式（这意味着国家-社会关系的内容以地理和官僚形式出现），这些形式服务于资本主义积累，但也可能给这一过程带来问题。虽然国家是一种社会关系/过程，就像所有社会关系/过程一样，它有一个地理（空间和规模）形式。虽然国家是阶级统治的关系/过程，这种阶级统治机制通过其特定的形式实现。因此，本章中的“形式”指的是给定内容的特定表现，或者是关系结构实际运作的机制。换句话说，“形式”一词/概念将在历史意义上使用得较少，在“实质性”意义上使用得较多。声称资本主义国家是阶级国家的一种形式是历史上使用形式-内容区别。声称资本主义国家具有地理形式和官僚形式适用于资本主义国家的所有历史阶段。但是，马克思在历史意义上使用形式的方式和本章中形式的使用方式之间有一个共同点：所谓的形式比所讨论的对象的形式更具具体性。这是以下特定意义上的：虽然所有资本主义国家都为资本主义阶级服务，但它们的特定地理形式和它们的官僚化程度将有所不同。虽然社会关系/过程/对象必然具有空间形式，但后者的实际因果意义将取决于所讨论的过程/关系/对象（Sayer, 1985）。在因果优先级方面，是社会关系，更具体地说，是阶级关系，优先于它们的空间形式（Das，2017b）。 在第1节中，我讨论了国家的地理形式，包括国家内部更地方和更中央分支之间的规模分工。国家的地方分支被认为对普通人更容易接近。第2节讨论了官僚形式——官僚主义的问题以及后者如何成为对普通人的一种统治形式。"},{"prompt":"请将“1 Geographical forms of the state and capitalist accumulation As we have seen, the state is rooted in economic relations. Economic relations not only include economic development but also the geography of economic development. Engels says: ‘The economic relations comprise . . . the geographical basis on which they operate and those remnants of earlier stages of economic development which have actually been transmitted and have survived — often only as a result of tradition or inertia’, the remnants that combine with modern features to produce combined development (more on this in Chapter 11). Economic relations comprise ‘also the external milieu which surrounds this form of society’ (in Marx and Engels, 1975: 441) and thus refer to the fact that what happens in a place/country can only be adequately understood in terms of its relations to other places/countries. This fact points to the matter of geographical scale too: if the state and capital in Canada are what they are because of their relations to those in India, the US, and many others, and vice versa, then Canada or the US belongs to one scale (say, the national scale) on top of which sits a higher scale, where all the different countries exist (say, the global scale). This is the mighty independent scale of the world-market. If economic development processes are geographical, so is the state geo-graphical. It is geographical in many ways. One is that its rules, more or less, operate within a specific territory. It has always been the case: In contrast to the old gentile organization, the state is distinguished firstly by the grouping of its members on a territorial basis. The old gentile bodies, formed and held together by ties of blood, had . . . become inadequate largely because they presupposed that the gentile members were bound to one particular locality, whereas this had long ago ceased to be the case. The territory was still there, but the people had become mobile. The territorial division was therefore taken as the starting point and the system introduced by which citizens exercised their public rights and duties where they took up residence, without regard to gens or tribe. This organization of the citizens of the state according to domicile is common to all states. (Engels, 1884) The state is also geographical or territorial in an ‘imperial sense’: a given state exists as one of many states, some more powerful than others. This means that individual states seek to improve their competitive position — competitive posi-tion of economic actors under their jurisdiction — vis-à-vis other states. To the extent that the state is a relation expressed as things, their presence is etched in the landscape (‘state-space’): police stations, prisons, army headquarters and barracks, court houses, government buildings, border fences, memorials celebrating wars, and so on, which are often built at great expenses even while the state says it has little money for the masses.3 There are also state- funded universities and radio/TV stations as parts of the state-space. The statespace serves to intimidate, and gain consent from, the masses. An important geographical aspect of the state is its scalarity. The scale of the territorial reach of the state, or of the state’s interaction with, and penetration into, society, has expanded over time, which corresponds to the scaling up of capitalist accumulation and development of technologies of transportation, communication, and surveillance. Lenin (1919a) says that society and the state were [earlier] . . . on a much smaller scale than they are now, they possessed incomparably poorer means of communication — Mountains, rivers and seas were immeasurably greater obstacles than they are now, and the state took shape within far narrower geographical boundaries. A technically weak state apparatus served a state confined within relatively narrow boundaries and with a narrow range of action. Capitalist accumulation is subject to mobility and fixity. This has implications for the state. More than pre-capitalist societies, it is the capitalist society that actively produces space through the annihilation of distance, and in this process the state plays a very important role as we have seen (consider state investment in physical infrastructures). Yet, no matter how mobile capital is, capitalist interests possess an element of place-specificity and fixity. One part of capital is more fixed than mobile. Money capital tends to be more mobile than productive capital. Resource-based productive capital tends to be less mobile than other forms of productive capital. Capital not only has to make a profit. Profit has also to be made here as opposed to there. Capitalism requires commodity exchanges, and these exchanges happen within, and across, specific territories. The state has to support not only profitability but profitability in particular places. This is expressed in the territorial aspects of the state (see Brenner, 1998, 1999; Clark and Dear, 1984; Harvey, 1985; Slater, 1989). State power exists at multiple scales. In the history of class society, ‘there is nothing inherently privileged about the national scale as a spatial unit of political organisation’ (Smith, 2006: 190). In the past, and especially in the precapitalist times, the state took the form of ‘city states and kingdoms, duchies and provinces, shires and cantons, and the like’ (ibid.). In fact, the national division of the globe is very much the twin of capitalism’s globalizing (universalizing) ambition as ‘it performed a crucial yet very specific function in the evolution of capitalism’ (Smith, 2006: 190). Just as social relations of capitalism act as a fetter on the development of productive forces, similarly, with the expansion of the scale of capital accumulation beyond geographically circumscribed localities, ‘the inherited political and territorial units of social, cultural and military organisation’ (that is, local-scale form of state power), are ‘no longer capable of administering economics that [have] outstripped old boundaries’ (ibid.). This is in the sense that [t]he expanded scale of economic power required expanded polities for helping to organise the process of capital accumulation, and it fell to emergent national states to create a new geography of more or less homogenous conditions internally — labour and tax laws, transportation systems, media, systems of social reproduction, state subsidy of capital, etc. The national state effectively organised a solution to the inherent contradiction between the need for socio-economic cooperation on the one side and economic competition, now implanted at the centre of the global economy, on the other. (Smith, 2006: 190-1) Or Harvey has explained: The more the bourgeoisie lost control over urban centers, the more it asserted the dominant role of the nation state. It reinforced the authority of the spaces it could control over the places it could not. This was the political lesson that the bourgeoisie learned from the rise of the industrial city as a powerhouse of accumulation and a crucible of class struggle. (Harvey, 1985: 200-1) ‘Politically, this meant increasing ruling-class reliance upon national and, ultimately, international power sources and the gradual reduction of the sphere of relative autonomy of urban-based class alliances’ (ibid.). State power under capitalism exists at national and global scales as well as subnational scales. From the standpoint of state power, the national scale remains the most important scale in part because of the concentration of the coercive state power at the national scale (and the ideological force of nationalism), while the world economy is ultimately the most important scale from the standpoint of capitalist accumulation and the law of value which constrains the operation of the nation-state. (This scalar difference that is characteristic of capitalism means that as capitalist accumulation has increasingly transcended the national scale and has become more global, there has arisen a contradiction between globalscale capitalist accumulation and its nation-state-based political framework.) Corresponding to the scale of the capitalist world economy, its ‘specific political form’ is ‘the modern system of nation states' (Barker, 2006: 83). Hirsch and Kannankulam (2011: 14) say that ‘the plurality of states is . . . an essential precondition for the reproduction and existence of modern capitalism’. Or, as Davidson (2016) says, competitive accumulation based on wage labour needs multiple states for different reasons. One is ‘the need for capitals to be territorially aggregated for competitive purposes’, as capitalist accumulation within self-contained isolated localities is not competitive (ibid.: 219—20). Another is ‘the need for that territory to have an ideological basis — nationalism — that can be used to bind the working class to the state and hence to capital’ (ibid.: 220). Capitalist competition has winners and losers. This fact has a geography: a winner may be in one country and a loser in another, because of uneven capitalist development at the international scale. This partly explains why ‘the capitalist class in its constituent parts continues to retain territorial home bases, presided over by states’: capitalists need the state ‘to ensure that the effects of competition are experienced as far as possible by someone else’ (ibid.). A global state could not do this. Indeed, in this respect it would be the same as having no state at all. For if everyone is protected, then no one is: unrestricted market relations would prevail, with all the risks that entails. The state . . . has to be able to distinguish between those capitals who will receive its protection and support, and those who will not. (Davidson, 2016: 220)4 And the latter means there are borders between states which need to be policed.5 It is also important to recognize that the multiplicity of states does not mean that all states are equally powerful. Imperialist states are a lot more powerful than other states, and this fact is an important aspect of the geographical form of the capitalist state, a form that in turn contributes to the reproduction of capitalism-under-imperialism. As the early Harvey (2012: 278), who took imperialism more seriously than he does now, puts it eloquently: In response to the organized power of labor within its borders, a particular nation-state may seek to export the worst elements of capitalist exploitation through imperialist domination of other countries. Imperialist domination has other functions also: facilitating capital export, preserving markets, maintaining access to an industrial reserve army, and the like. By these means a nation-state may purchase the allegiance of elements of the working class within its borders at the expense of labor in dependent countries.”翻译为中文","completion":"1 国家的地理形式与资本主义积累 正如我们所看到的，国家植根于经济关系之中。经济关系不仅包括经济发展，还包括经济发展的地理布局。恩格斯说：“经济关系包括...它们运作的地理基础以及那些实际上已经被传递和幸存下来的较早经济发展阶段的残留物——这些残留物常常只是由于传统或惯性的结果”，这些残留物与现代特征相结合，产生了联合发展（更多内容见第11章）。经济关系还包括“包围这种社会形式的外部环境”（在马克思和恩格斯，1975：441）因此指的是，一个地方/国家中发生的事件只能通过其与其他地方/国家的关系来充分理解。这一事实也指向了地理规模的问题：如果加拿大的国家和资本之所以是现状，是因为它们与印度、美国等国的关系，反之亦然，那么加拿大或美国属于一个规模（比如，国家规模），在其上还有更高的规模，所有不同的国家都存在于其中（比如，全球规模）。这就是世界市场的强大独立规模。 如果经济发展过程是地理性的，那么国家也是地理性的。它以多种方式具有地理性。一种方式是它的规则或多或少在特定领土内运作。这一直是这样的： 与旧的氏族组织相比，国家首先通过其成员的地域性分组来区分。由血缘关系形成和维系在一起的旧氏族机构...在很大程度上已变得不足，因为它们预设了氏族成员必须绑定在特定地点，而这早已不再是情况。领土还在那里，但人们已经变得流动。因此，以领土划分作为起点，引入了公民在他们居住地行使公共权利和义务的制度，而不考虑氏族或部落。这种根据住所对国家公民进行组织的做法是所有国家所共有的。 （恩格斯，1884） 国家在“帝国意义上”也是地理性或领土性的：一个特定的国家作为许多国家之一存在，其中一些比其他国家更有权力。这意味着各个国家寻求改善自己的竞争地位——它们管辖下经济行为者的竞争地位——相对于其他国家。 在国家作为事物表现的关系中，其存在被刻画在景观中（“国家空间”）：警察局、监狱、军队总部和兵营、法院、政府建筑、边境围栏、庆祝战争的纪念碑等，这些经常以巨大的费用建造，即使国家声称对大众几乎没有资金。也有国家资助的大学和广播/电视台作为国家空间的一部分。国家空间旨在恐吓并获得大众的同意。 国家的一个重要地理方面是其尺度性。国家的领土范围的规模，或国家与社会的互动和渗透的规模，随着时间推移而扩大，这与资本积累的升级以及交通、通讯和监视技术的发展相一致。列宁（1919a）说 社会和国家[以前]...规模要小得多，他们拥有的交流手段也要贫乏得多——山脉、河流和海洋是比现在大得多的障碍，而国家在更狭窄的地理边界内形成。技术薄弱的国家机构服务于一个范围相对狭窄且行动范围有限的国家。 资本积累受到流动性和固定性的制约。这对国家有影响。与前资本主义社会相比，资本主义社会通过消灭距离积极生产空间，在这一过程中国家扮演了非常重要的角色，正如我们所看到的（考虑国家对物理基础设施的投资）。然而，无论资本多么流动，资本主义利益都具有一定的地点特异性和固定性。资本的一部分比其他部分更固定。货币资本往往比生产资本更具流动性。基于资源的生产资本往往不如其他形式的生产资本那样具有流动性。资本不仅要获利，利润还必须在这里而不是那里获得。资本主义需要商品交换，这些交换发生在特定领土内部和跨领土。国家不仅要支持盈利性，还要在特定地点支持盈利性。这体现在国家的领土方面（见Brenner, 1998, 1999; Clark and Dear, 1984; Harvey, 1985; Slater, 1989）。 国家权力存在于多个尺度上。在阶级社会的历史中，“国家尺度作为政治组织的空间单位并没有固有的特权”（史密斯，2006：190）。在过去，尤其是在前资本主义时代，国家采取“城邦和王国、公国和省份、郡和州等”的形式（同上）。事实上，全球的国家划分很大程度上是资本主义全球化（普遍化）愿望的孪生兄弟，因为“它在资本主义进化中执行了一个关键而非常特定的功能”（史密斯，2006：190）。正如资本主义的社会关系阻碍了生产力的发展一样，随着资本积累的规模扩展超出地理上限定的地方，“遗传的政治和领土单位的社会、文化和军事组织”（即，地方尺度的国家权力形式），“已不再能够管理超出旧界限的经济”（同上）。这是因为 “经济权力规模的扩大需要扩大的政体来帮助组织资本积累的过程，新兴的民族国家有效地组织了一种解决方案，内部创造了更或少均质条件——劳动和税收法律、运输系统、媒体、社会再生产系统、对资本的国家补贴等。民族国家有效地组织了解决方案，既满足了一方面社会经济合作的需要，又解决了现已植入全球经济中心的经济竞争的内在矛盾。” （史密斯，2006：190-1） 或者哈维解释说： “资产阶级对城市中心的控制越失去，就越强调国家的主导作用。它加强了它可以控制的空间对它无法控制的地方的权威。这是资产阶级从工业城市作为积累动力和阶级斗争熔炉的崛起中学到的政治教训。” （哈维，1985：200-1） “在政治上，这意味着日益增加的统治阶级依赖于国家乃至最终的国际权力来源，并逐渐减少了基于城市的阶级联盟的相对自治领域”（同上）。在资本主义下的国家权力存在于国家和全球尺度以及次国家尺度上。 从国家权力的立场来看，国家尺度部分由于国家强制力量在国家尺度上的集中（和民族主义的意识形态力量），而保持着最重要的尺度，而从资本积累和制约国家运作的价值法则的立场来看，世界经济最终是最重要的尺度。（这种资本主义特有的尺度差异意味着，随着资本积累日益超越国家尺度，变得更加全球化，国家基础政治框架下的全球尺度资本积累之间出现了矛盾。） 与资本主义世界经济的尺度相对应，其“特定的政治形式”是“现代民族国家体系”（巴克尔，2006：83）。希尔希和坎南库拉姆（2011：14）说，“国家的多样性...是现代资本主义复制和存在的基本前提”。或者，正如戴维森（2016）所说，基于工资劳动的竞争性积累需要多个国家出于不同原因。一个是“出于竞争目的需要领土聚合资本”，因为在孤立的封闭地方内的资本积累无法竞争（同上：219-20）。另一个是“需要该领土有一个意识形态基础——民族主义——可以用来将工人阶级与国家以及因此与资本绑定”（同上：220）。资本主义竞争有赢家和输家。这个事实具有地理性：赢家可能在一个国家，输家可能在另一个国家，因为在国际尺度上资本主义发展不平衡。这部分解释了“资本主义阶级为其组成部分继续保留领土基地，由国家主持”：“资本家需要国家‘确保尽可能由其他人来体验竞争的影响’”（同上）。 全球国家无法做到这一点。事实上，在这方面，它与根本没有国家是一样的。因为如果每个人都受到保护，那么就没有人受到保护：市场关系将不受限制地占主导地位，带来所有相关的风险。国家...必须能够区分哪些资本将获得其保护和支持，哪些则不会。 （戴维森，2016：220）4 而后者意味着国家之间有边界，需要警察来维护。5 还重要的是要认识到，国家的多样性并不意味着所有国家都同样强大。帝国主义国家比其他国家强大得多，这一事实是资本主义国家地理形式的重要方面，反过来又促进了帝国主义下资本主义的再生产。正如早期的哈维（2012：278）所 eloquently 地表达的，他对帝国主义的重视比现在更多： 为了应对其边境内劳动力的有组织力量，一个特定的民族国家可能寻求通过对其他国家的帝国主义统治来输出资本主义剥削的最恶劣元素。帝国主义统治还有其他功能：促进资本输出，保护市场，维持对工业后备军的获取等等。通过这些手段，一个民族国家可能以依赖国家的劳动力为代价，购买其边界内工人阶级的忠诚。"},{"prompt":"请将“It is important to stress that while state and capital interact universally, one capi-talist state is not the same as another. Each state develops uniquely in relation to combined and uneven development within a national territory: nature of pre- and non-capitalist class relations, the balance between formal and real subsumption of labour by capital, and social (racial/gender) oppression and its relation to capitalism, and the degree to which and ways in which one country, including its various regions, is linked to other countries and to the world market. States are also different one from another because their territorial jurisdictions are different in terms of the balance among productive and non-productive forms of capital, balance among capitals in different sectors, the level of economic development, the level of cultural development (e.g. literacy), the previous history of state-capital interaction, history of common people’s struggle, and the extent to which there is a relationship between capitalists and state personnel, that needs a lot of time to develop and is not geographically portable. With the emergence of a world capitalist system along with transnational capitalist operations, the nation-state has not gone away, but some of its functions are scaled up or scaled down. This means that some of its tasks are performed more by sub-national institutions of the state, and other tasks are performed more by state or state-like institutions at the global scale constituting what Picciotto and Radice call a new state.6 The ‘increasing scalarization’ of state power — the fact that this power is increasingly exercised at extra-local scales — does not mean that state-society relation at a local scale has lost all its importance. The multiplicity of what can be called state-scales represents tendencies towards scalar decentralization and scalar concentration: Although the making of the national scale thus played a pivotal role in the early evolution of capitalism, it is not unique in proffering territorial solu-tions to the political economic contradictions between competition and cooperation, differentiation and equalisation, in capitalist societies. Parallel processes operate at other scales, equally if differently embedded in and transformed by the needs of capital accumulation. Across history, the urban scale has provided various social functions, centralising not just economic but military, religious, cultural and political power. (Smith, 2006: 191) The urbanization of capital makes the urban scale, which may be defined in terms of an urban labour market (or what Harvey calls ‘structured coherence’), an important scale (Harvey, 1985). Closely related to the urban scale is what I would call the city-region which includes a city and its surrounding rural or semi-rural areas. This scale, which is an important subnational scale, is where most of the everyday interaction happens in dominantly urban or even urbanizing societies. This represents the gradual expansion of urban capitalist accumulation into non-urban or semi-urban areas not only through real-estate development on the basis of the conversation of farm-land, but also what Lenin (1899) calls ‘the transplantation of large-scale capitalist industry to the rural districts’. The city-region (or the urban scale) scale is where capitalist accumulation happens and labour power is reproduced. This is also where the exercise of state power is effected and experienced by people, as the state shapes both accumulation of capitalist wealth and reproduction of labour power. This is also the scale where labour resistance to capital and the state begins to form and tends to be concentrated. Not surprisingly, apart from the national borders, the city-region is where the coercive powers of the state are concentrated, as seen in its landscape. Indeed, specific parts of the city-region are devoted to the police and military apparatus of the state to protect the seats of capital and of state power against not only the urban working class, including recent ruralurban migrants, but also a potentially angry bloc of rural small-scale producers and workers waiting at the city border and beyond, a bloc which can be part of a politically explosive alliance with the urban working class. There is a scale division of labour within the nation-state. This is indicated by the division of responsibilities between central/national organs and more regional/local branches (Cox, 2002: 250—1) which operate within a nested hierarchy.7 Legislators commonly represent territorially defined populations (ibid.). More local branches (e.g. provincial and sub-provincial branches) can be more accessible to common people than the central branch. Some capitalist states are unitary states and other states are federal: Unitary states (e.g. the UK) and federal states (e.g. the US, India) are different in terms of the scale division of labour, although there is growing concentration of power in the central branches of the state and in the hands of the ‘chief executive’.8 At a given scale, state policies (e.g. minimum wage policy, or unemployment insurance policy) can geographically vary in part because of the specificity of state institutions in different city-regions/provinces. Such variation creates a geography of business climate and thus an important reason for capital mobility within the jurisdiction of, say, the national state. Given that common people put pressure on the state and on capitalists for concessions and given that the state (as well as) capitalism operates at the local scale (as well as higher scales), it is important that we do not lose sight of the localness of social relations and class struggle. However, a distinction is to be made between ‘spaces of dependence’ and ‘spaces of engagement’ (Cox, 1998): ‘[I]n evaluating the strategies of individual agents and their organizations, as they construct the networks through which they hope to accomplish their ends, the spatial structure of the state, its scale division of labor, is an important consideration’ (p. 15). The scales at which class struggle happens does not necessarily match the scales at which the state power is exercised. Locally dependent workers (workers living in a city) can make use of provincial and national-level political resources in their local struggles against the state and capital. Capital does not just lobby for specific state policies but policies that benefit capitalist interests in particular places/cities, regions, and nations. Locally dependent or nationally dependent businesses may want protection from com-petition from capitalists located elsewhere. A given law may disadvantage or favour (some) businesses in region x as opposed to region y. If some firms are relocating from high-wage to low-wage areas, the more locally dependent firms (retailers, banks, utility companies, and so on) may want some intervention: they may want a more uniform national-scale law in support of workers (e.g. minimum wage law) rather than the laws according to which support for workers comes from the revenues from local jurisdictions. Sometimes fractions of labour and of capital of a given area come together for state support, and they do so in opposition to other such regionally based cross-class coalitions (Harvey, 1985; Cox, 1998). State policies at a given scale (policies of the local state or provincial state) have territorial impacts (Duncan and Goodwin, 1987). For example, the state divides an area into various land use zones. It also establishes various geographically delimited, or territorialized, use-values for collective consumption such as national and local parks. Capitalism is known to produce uneven development at all scales (for example, uneven development between cities/ city-regions and between provinces) in part due to the dialectic of geographical concentration of investment in some areas at the expense of other areas (causing differentiation) and the opposite process of equalization (movement of investment across areas) (Das, 2017b; Smith, 2008; Harvey, 2009). Under capitalism, at a given point in time, some areas become more developed than other areas; some areas are more profitable than other areas. Given the role of the state in assisting capitalist accumulation, state institutions at a given scale seek to attract businesses into their jurisdictions. The state provides special benefits to relatively less developed areas to attract capital — for example, ‘opportunity zones’ in the US, discussed earlier. The state also seeks to attract investment to special economic zones, which suggests that not all laws apply equally to all the areas inside the jurisdiction of the state. Consider the offshore centres: their existence suggests that ‘a sovereign state offers foreign investors the ability to act economically on its territory under legal conditions that differ from those that apply to its own citizens’, an offer that ‘consists in a renun-ciation of the universality of law in the state territory’ (Gerstenberger, 2009: 684). And ‘in terms of state theory, it has made a fiction of the principle that the laws of a particular country apply to its territory [equally]. This has sideeffects on the prospects for labour struggles’ (ibid.: 684). In fact, the usual laws protecting trade unions rights do not apply in these offshore centres or special enterprise zones, which have ‘greatly accelerated the international dynamic of deregulation’ of businesses. Capitalism is known for uneven and combined development (discussed in Chapter 11). Often uneven development gives rise to what is known as internal colonialism: areas and peoples (wage workers and small-scale producers) are politically prevented from being able to sell their labour power and other commodities at the market rate and are thus subjected to above-average exploi-tation. This happens in the interests of specific fractions of the capitalist class that control state power, often justified on the basis of its ethnicity, and so on. 2 Bureaucratic state form and political domination by the state When Lenin (1919a) talks about a ‘technically weak state apparatus’ that operates ‘within relatively narrow boundaries and with a narrow range of action’, he appears to hint at what Michael Mann (2012: 13)) would call infrastructural power which is to be distinguished from despotic power: Despotic power is the ability of state elites to make arbitrary decisions without consultation with the representatives of major civil society groups. Infrastructural power is the capacity of a state (whether despotic or democratic) to actually penetrate society and implement logistically political decisions throughout the realm. . . . ‘Infrastructural power’ enables states to diffuse their power through or penetrate their societies (‘power through’); while the exercise of ‘despotic power’ is by a state which has a degree of authoritative ‘power over’ society. The implication of this is that ‘states may be “strong” in either of two quite different ways’. That is, ‘states can command anything they like of their citizens (despotic power) or they can actually get decisions implemented across their territories (infrastructural power)’ (Mann, 2012: 13).”翻译为中文","completion":"1 国家的地理形式与资本主义积累 重要的是要强调，尽管国家和资本普遍相互作用，但一个资本主义国家并不等同于另一个。每个国家都在与国家领土内的综合与不平衡发展相关的方式中独特发展：前资本主义和非资本主义阶级关系的性质、劳动力被资本正式和实际征用的平衡，以及社会（种族/性别）压迫及其与资本主义的关系，以及一个国家（包括其不同地区）与其他国家及世界市场的联系程度和方式。国家之间也因其领土管辖范围在生产性和非生产性形式的资本之间的平衡、不同部门资本之间的平衡、经济发展水平、文化发展水平（例如，识字率）、国家-资本互动的历史、平民斗争的历史，以及资本家与国家人员之间关系的程度有所不同，这种关系需要很长时间发展且在地理上不可移植。 随着世界资本主义体系的出现，以及跨国资本主义运营，民族国家并未消失，但其某些功能被放大或缩小了。这意味着，其部分任务更多地由国家的次级机构执行，其他任务更多地由全球规模的国家或类国家机构执行，构成了皮恰托和拉迪斯称之为的新国家。 国家权力的“日益增加的尺度化”——这种权力越来越多地在超地方规模上行使——并不意味着国家与社会关系在地方规模上失去了所有重要性。所谓的国家尺度的多样性代表了尺度去中心化和尺度集中的趋势： 尽管在资本主义早期发展中国家尺度的形成起到了关键作用，但它在提供资本主义社会竞争与合作、差异化与均等化之间的政治经济矛盾的领土解决方案方面并非独一无二。在其他尺度上同样运行着平行的过程，这些过程同样以不同的方式嵌入并被资本积累的需求所改造。贯穿历史，城市尺度提供了各种社会功能，不仅集中了经济力量，还集中了军事、宗教、文化和政治力量。 （史密斯，2006: 191） 资本的城市化使得城市尺度，可能根据城市劳动力市场（或哈维所称的“结构性一致性”）来定义，成为一个重要的尺度（哈维，1985）。与城市尺度紧密相关的是我所称的城市-区域，它包括一个城市及其周边的农村或半农村地区。这个尺度是一个重要的次国家尺度，在这里发生了大多数主导城市或甚至城市化社会的日常互动。这代表了城市资本主义积累逐渐扩展到非城市或半城市地区的过程，不仅通过基于农田转化的房地产开发，也包括列宁（1899）所说的“将大规模资本主义工业移植到农村地区”。城市-区域（或城市尺度）是资本积累发生和劳动力再生产的地方。这也是国家权力得以行使和人们经历国家权力的地方，国家塑造了资本主义财富的积累和劳动力的再生产。这也是劳动抵抗资本和国家开始形成和倾向于集中的尺度。并不奇怪，除了国家边界，城市-区域是国家强制力量集中的地方，正如其景观所见。实际上，城市-区域的特定部分被专门用于国家的警察和军事装备，以保护资本和国家权力的中心，不仅针对城市工人阶级，包括最近的农村-城市移民，还针对在城市边界及其以外等待的潜在愤怒的农村小规模生产者和工人群体，这个群体可以成为与城市工人阶级形成政治上易爆联盟的一部分。 在民族国家内部存在劳动分工的尺度。这一点可以从中央/国家机构与更地区化/地方分支之间的责任划分中看出（考克斯，2002：250—1），这些分支在嵌套的等级制度内运作。立法者通常代表地域性定义的人口（同上）。更地方的分支（例如，省级和次省级分支）可能比中央分支更容易被普通民众接触。有些资本主义国家是单一制国家，其他国家是联邦制：单一制国家（例如，英国）和联邦制国家（例如，美国、印度）在劳动分工的尺度上有所不同，尽管国家中央机构和“最高行政长官”的权力集中化趋势不断增长。在给定的尺度上，国家政策（例如，最低工资政策或失业保险政策）可能部分因为不同城市-区域/省份的国家机构的特殊性而在地理上有所不同。这种变化创造了商业环境地理，因此成为资本在国家管辖区域内（例如，国家国家）流动的一个重要原因。 鉴于普通民众向国家和资本家施压以获得让步，并且国家（以及资本主义）在地方尺度（以及更高尺度）上运作，我们不应该忽视社会关系和阶级斗争的地方性。然而，需要区分“依赖空间”和“参与空间”（考克斯，1998）：“在评估个体代理人及其组织的策略时，他们通过这些网络构建希望实现其目的，国家的空间结构，其劳动分工的尺度，是一个重要的考虑因素”（第15页）。阶级斗争发生的尺度不一定与国家权力行使的尺度相匹配。依赖地方的工人（居住在一个城市的工人）可以利用省级和国家级政治资源在其地方斗争中反对国家和资本。 资本不仅游说特定的国家政策，还游说有利于特定地点/城市、地区和国家的资本主义利益的政策。依赖地方或依赖国家的企业可能希望得到保护，以免受到其他地方资本家的竞争。某一法律可能对区域x的（一些）企业不利，而对区域y有利。如果一些公司正从高工资区域迁移到低工资区域，那么更依赖地方的公司（零售商、银行、公用事业公司等）可能希望进行一些干预：他们可能希望有一个更统一的全国性法律来支持工人（例如，最低工资法），而不是根据法律来支持工人的法律来自地方管辖区的收入。有时，特定地区的劳动力和资本的一部分会联合起来寻求国家支持，他们这样做是为了反对其他基于地区的跨阶级联盟（哈维，1985；考克斯，1998）。 给定尺度的国家政策（地方国家或省级国家的政策）具有领土影响（邓肯和古德温，1987）。例如，国家将某一地区划分为各种土地使用区。它还为集体消费建立了各种地理界定的或领土化的使用价值，如国家和地方公园。众所周知，资本主义在所有尺度上都产生了不均衡发展（例如，城市/城市-区域之间和省份之间的不均衡发展），部分原因是投资在一些地区的地理集中（引起差异化）和反向过程的均衡化（投资跨地区运动）（Das，2017b；史密斯，2008；哈维，2009）。在资本主义下，某一时刻，一些地区比其他地区更发达；一些地区比其他地区更有利可图。鉴于国家在协助资本积累方面的作用，特定尺度的国家机构寻求吸引企业进入其管辖范围。国家为相对不发达地区提供特殊福利以吸引资本——例如，之前讨论的美国的“机会区”。国家还寻求吸引投资到特殊经济区，这表明并不是所有法律都平等地适用于国家管辖范围内的所有地区。考虑离岸中心：它们的存在表明“一个主权国家为外国投资者提供在其领土上在与适用于本国公民不同的法律条件下进行经济活动的能力”，这种提议“包含在国家领土上放弃法律的普遍性”（Gerstenberger, 2009：684）。这在国家理论方面，已经将特定国家领土上适用的法律[平等地]适用的原则变成了一种虚构。这对劳动斗争的前景产生了副作用”（同上：684）。事实上，通常保护工会权利的法律在这些离岸中心或特殊企业区不适用，这些地区“极大地加速了企业放松管制的国际动态”。 资本主义以不均衡和联合发展而闻名（见第11章讨论）。不均衡发展通常导致所谓的内部殖民主义的出现：地区和人民（工资工人和小规模生产者）在政治上被阻止以市场价格出售其劳动力和其他商品，因而受到高于平均水平的剥削。这是为了控制国家权力的特定资本主义阶层的利益，往往以种族等为基础来进行辩护。 2 官僚国家形式和国家的政治统治 当列宁（1919a）谈及“技术薄弱的国家机构”在“相对狭窄的范围内以有限的行动范围”运作时，他似乎暗示了迈克尔·曼（2012: 13）所称的基础设施权力，该权力与专制权力有所区别： 专制权力是指国家精英在不与主要民间社会团体的代表协商的情况下做出任意决定的能力。基础设施权力是指一个国家（无论是专制的还是民主的）实际渗透社会并在整个领域内执行政治决策的能力...“基础设施权力”使国家能够通过或渗透其社会（“通过权力”）；而“专制权力”的行使是由一个在某种程度上对社会具有权威的“控制权”的国家来执行的。 这意味着“国家可能以两种完全不同的方式‘强大’”。也就是说，“国家可以命令其公民做任何事情（专制权力），或者它们可以实际上在其领土上执行决策（基础设施权力）”（曼，2012：13）。"},{"prompt":"Thread Title: Squish Cartoon Coming to Kids WB! Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.

The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. Gloopy is a teal blob of slime, who’s malleable nature allows him to shape-shift Glitter is a sparkling fuschia blob, and she is his best friend They are both aliens. Write a story where she decides to see how he is doing, and sees him listening to cool music, with headphones wrapped around his gelatinous body It had been a busy week for Gloopy. As a shape-shifting alien, he was constantly being called upon to help out with various tasks on their home planet. But despite the hectic schedule, he always found time to relax and unwind with his best friend, Glitter. One day, Glitter decided to check in on Gloopy to see how he was doing. She made her way to his living quarters and found him lying on his blob-like form, headphones wrapped around his gelatinous body. He had a contented smile on his face as he listened to the cool music playing through the headphones. “Hey Gloopy, what are you listening to?” Glitter asked, floating over to him. Gloopy opened his eyes and grinned at his friend. “Oh, just some tunes I picked up from a neighboring planet. It’s really relaxing and helps me decompress after a long day.” Glitter nodded in understanding. “That’s great, you deserve some rest after all the hard work you’ve been putting in. Mind if I join you?” Gloopy happily moved over, making space for Glitter to settle down next to him. They lay there in comfortable silence, listening to the music and enjoying each other’s company. As the music played on, Glitter couldn’t help but feel grateful for her friendship with Gloopy. He may be a teal blob of slime, but he was the most caring and supportive friend she could ask for. And with him by her side, she knew that no matter what challenges came their way, they would always have each other. With a smile on her face, Glitter snuggled closer to Gloopy, feeling the warmth of their bond enveloping them both. And in that moment, listening to the calming music, she knew that there was nowhere else she would rather be than right here with her best friend. Write a story where a green alien touches him, is amazed that his hand sinks into the gelatinous substance, and that he is amazed he is made of slime One day, as Gloopy was relaxing in his living quarters, a curious green alien approached him. Intrigued by Gloopy’s malleable nature, the alien reached out a hand and gently touched him. To his surprise, his hand sank into Gloopy’s gelatinous substance, feeling the cool and smooth texture beneath his fingers. The green alien’s eyes widened in amazement as he realized that Gloopy was made of slime. He had never encountered anything like it before and was fascinated by the unique abilities of the teal blob. Gloopy, for his part, chuckled at the alien’s reaction and morphed his form to engulf the alien’s hand in a gentle hug. “It’s all right, I’m used to it,” Gloopy said with a grin. “Being able to shape-shift has its perks, you know.” The green alien nodded, still in awe of Gloopy’s unusual composition. He couldn’t help but marvel at the way Gloopy could change his form at will, molding himself into different shapes and sizes. It was a talent that the alien had never imagined possible, and he found himself admiring Gloopy’s versatility and adaptability. As the green alien continued to interact with Gloopy, he realized that despite their differences, they both shared a sense of camaraderie and friendship. Gloopy’s unique nature may have been surprising at first, but it was ultimately what brought them together and strengthened their bond. And so, the green alien spent the rest of the day getting to know Gloopy better, learning about his abilities and enjoying the company of his new friend. As they laughed and talked, the alien couldn’t help but feel grateful for the chance encounter that led him to discover the amazing teal blob of slime who had become an important part of his life. Write a story where A evil bounty hunter shoots him, resulting in teal slime splattered but the they start moving and reforming, It turns out he can reform from even the smallest drop, and with a tentacle like appendage, he reaches for a phone and calls the space police and has the hunter brought to justice Gloopy was enjoying a peaceful afternoon on his home planet when the tranquility was suddenly shattered by the appearance of a menacing figure - an evil bounty hunter looking to capture him. Before Gloopy could react, the hunter fired a powerful blast from his blaster, hitting Gloopy directly and causing teal slime to splatter all around. At first, it seemed like Gloopy had been defeated as his form dispersed into countless tiny droplets of slime. The bounty hunter sneered in triumph. But to his horror, the splattered teal slime began to move and reform, each droplet connecting to the others and slowly piecing Gloopy back together. The evil bounty hunter watched in shock as Gloopy’s slime started to reform and regenerate, his teal body reshaping and taking form once again. And to the hunter’s surprise, Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage, reaching for a nearby communication device. With determination in his gooey form, Gloopy managed to reach the phone and dial the emergency line for the space police. His voice, though gurgled and distorted, came through the receiver as he reported the actions of the evil bounty hunter and requested immediate assistance. The space police responded swiftly, arriving at the scene to find the hunter standing over Gloopy, who had fully reformed and was prepared to defend himself. The evil bounty hunter was no match for the combined forces of the space police and Gloopy, who used his shape-shifting abilities to outmaneuver and subdue the villain. In the end, justice was served as the evil bounty hunter was apprehended and taken into custody by the space police. Gloopy’s resilience and quick thinking had saved him from capture and allowed him to bring the criminal to justice. As the space police commended Gloopy for his bravery and resourcefulness, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride in his abilities. Despite his slimy nature, he had proven that he was a force to be reckoned with, able to overcome even the most dangerous of adversaries. And as he stood among his friends and allies, he knew that no one would ever underestimate the teal blob of slime again. Write that story from Glitter’s POV, she almost cried Glitter watched in horror as the evil bounty hunter took aim at Gloopy, her best friend. The blast hit Gloopy directly, causing his teal slime to splatter in all directions. Tears pricked at the corners of Glitter’s sparkling fuschia eyes as she saw Gloopy’s form disperse into countless droplets of slime on the ground. As the bounty hunter sneered in triumph, Glitter’s heart ached with fear. But then, something miraculous happened. The teal slime began to move and reform, each droplet connecting back together. Gloopy was piecing himself back together, defying all odds and showing off his incredible ability to regenerate. Glitter felt a surge of relief and awe as she watched Gloopy reform before her eyes. Her tears of fear turned into tears of pride as she saw her best friend stand tall once more, ready to take on the evil bounty hunter. She had always known Gloopy was special, but this display of resilience and determination left her speechless. When Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage and reached for the phone, calling the space police for help, Glitter’s admiration for him grew even stronger. She could see the bravery and strength within her friend, and she couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of love and gratitude for him. As the space police arrived and apprehended the bounty hunter, Glitter floated over to Gloopy, her sparkling form shimmering with relief. She hovered next to him, almost overwhelmed with emotion as she witnessed his victory over the villain. With a quivering voice, Glitter expressed her feelings to Gloopy, “I… I was so scared. I thought I lost you, my dear friend. But you… you are truly incredible, Gloopy. I almost cried when I saw you reforming from those tiny droplets. I am so grateful for you, and so proud to call you my best friend.” Gloopy turned to Glitter, a warm smile spreading across his teal slime. “Thank you, Glitter,” he said softly. “I couldn’t have done it without you by my side. Your support means everything to me.” And as they stood together, basking in the victory and their unbreakable bond, Glitter knew that she would always be there for Gloopy, no matter what challenges they faced. They were more than just friends – they were partners in crime, united in strength and love. And with tears glistening in her eyes, Glitter knew that Gloopy would forever hold a special place in her sparkling heart. Write a story where Glitter talks to a tentacled creature while Gloopy is in the bathroom While Gloopy was busy in the bathroom taking care of his slimey business, Glitter decided to explore their surroundings on their home planet. She floated through the corridors until she came across a room filled with strange and fascinating creatures. One in particular caught her attention - a tentacled creature with shimmering scales and curious eyes. Glitter approached the tentacled creature, her sparkling fuschia form radiating with curiosity. The creature turned to her, its tentacles gently waving in the air as it observed the glittering alien before it. With a gentle smile, Glitter started a conversation with the creature, fascinated by its unique appearance and mysterious aura. “Hello there, I’m Glitter. What’s your name?” she asked, her voice gentle and welcoming. The tentacled creature regarded her with a blend of curiosity and warmth. It responded in a melodic and unfamiliar language, its tentacles moving in intricate patterns that seemed to convey meaning. Glitter couldn’t understand the words, but she could sense the creature’s friendly nature and willingness to communicate. As they continued to interact, Glitter and the tentacled creature found ways to communicate through gestures, expressions, and the universal language of friendship. They shared stories about their respective worlds, exchanged knowledge about their cultures, and bonded over their shared love for exploration and discovery. In the midst of their conversation, Gloopy emerged from the bathroom, his teal slime glistening under the light. He was surprised to see Glitter engaged in conversation with the tentacled creature, but he couldn’t help but smile at the sight. It warmed his gelatinous heart to see his best friend forming connections with other beings, even in his absence. Approaching them, Gloopy joined the conversation, introducing himself to the tentacled creature and exchanging greetings. The creature responded in kind, its tentacles forming complex patterns that seemed to convey joy and acceptance. As they continued to talk and share stories, Glitter, Gloopy, and the tentacled creature discovered a newfound kinship that transcended language and appearance. They laughed, learned, and bonded over their shared moments of connection, grateful for the opportunity to forge friendships across different worlds. And as they floated together, bathed in the glow of friendship and understanding, Glitter couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for the beautiful encounters that life had to offer. In that moment, amidst laughter and camaraderie, she knew that the universe was full of wonders waiting to be explored and cherished. Write a story where a human traveler wonders how creatures like them can even exist while pointing at them, confused by their amorphous, slime body The human traveler had journeyed far across the cosmos, seen many wonders, and encountered various forms of life. But nothing prepared him for the sight of Gloopy and Glitter. As he strolled through the intergalactic bazaar, a hive of chatter and exotic items from a thousand worlds, his eyes fell upon the pair: one a teal blob with headphones slack around its body, and the other a sparkling fuschia entity, hovering nearby. “Excuse me,” the traveler said, trying to mask his astonishment as he approached them. “How do creatures like you even exist?” He pointed at them, his finger moving from one to the other, clearly baffled by their amorphous, slime forms. Gloopy, who had just removed his headphones, turned his gelatinous face toward the traveler and reshaped his ‘body’ to form what resembled a head with an amiable expression. “You know, we get that a lot,” Gloopy replied in a casual tone, his voice emanating from within his slime form. “We’re just different expressions of life. It’s like how on your planet, you have humans, octopuses, and things that are even stranger.” Glitter shimmered intensely for a moment, as if laughing. “Yeah, and just because we don’t have bones or skin like you do, doesn’t make us any less real.” The traveler knelt down, inspecting Gloopy more closely. “Forgive me, it’s not every day you see a sentient blob of slime… I mean—” “No offense taken,” Gloopy interjected with a morphing smile. “We understand our appearance can be quite, well, alien.” The human nodded slowly, his curiosity piqued. “Do you have organs like us? Bones or…anything?” he asked, his gaze drifting from Gloopy to Glitter and back again. Glitter giggled, a sparkling sound that echoed like tiny bells. “Nope! We’re one hundred percent slime based. We have specialized cells that can do all the necessary functions: take in nutrients, expel waste, you name it.” “And we can morph and stretch, which comes in handy,” Gloopy added, demonstrating by extending an arm-like appendage to twice its original length. “So, you’re basically immortal then? You can’t be hurt?” the traveler mused aloud. “Not exactly,” Gloopy responded, his texture turning a bit more serious. “We can get hurt, but as you may have noticed, we can recover from many injuries by re-forming our bodies.” The traveler stood up, a newfound respect etched upon his face. “Incredible. I’ve studied exobiology, but you two defy all conventional understanding. You’re living proof that life is diverse and endlessly surprising.” Gloopy and Glitter exchanged a look, a silent communication passing between them. “You know,” Glitter said, “Maybe we can teach you a thing or two about life beyond what is known on Earth.” The traveler’s eyes sparkled with the promise of knowledge yet undiscovered. “I’d like that very much,” he said, his perspective on life broader than ever before. “It would be an honor to learn from you both.” As the suns set on the horizon, casting an array of colorful hues across the sky, the trio settled down for what would be the first of many discussions about the vast complexities and beauties of the universe. Together, they explored the profound mysteries of life, becoming ambassadors of their respective worlds, and friends who would share wonders beyond imagination. Write a story where they ask the scientist if there are anyone like them on other planet Gloopy and Glitter had always been curious about the vast expanse of the cosmos and whether there were other beings like them scattered across different worlds. Their inquisitive natures led them to seek out the wisdom of a renowned interstellar scientist, Dr. Lysara, who specialized in xenobiology and the study of extraterrestrial life forms. They found Dr. Lysara in her laboratory, tucked away on a space station that orbited a vibrant nebula, a place teeming with scientific discovery and intergalactic study. The laboratory was filled with holographic projections of different planets and life forms, and the air hummed with data streams from her field explorations. “Dr. Lysara,” Glitter began, her sparkling form catching the ambient light, “we have traveled across the stars to ask you a question that burns within us.” Dr. Lysara, a human-like being with skin the color of twilight and eyes that shone like binary stars, turned to the pair with interest. “And what question is that, my iridescent friends?” Gloopy reshaped his form into something resembling a chair and settled himself comfortably. “We wonder,” he said, “are there others like us out there? Beings made of slime or similar substances? Have your explorations revealed creatures who are malleable, like me, or sparkling, like Glitter?” The scientist’s eyes gleamed with a mixture of excitement and thoughtfulness as she listened to their query. She walked over to her terminal, her fingers gliding across a control panel that activated a three-dimensional galactic map. “Your question is both profound and intriguing,” Dr. Lysara replied, her voice echoing softly in the high-ceilinged room. “The universe is vast and filled with wonders, and my research has indeed uncovered a plethora of life forms with unique compositions.” She tapped on the holographic interface, and images of various planets and organisms began to float in the air around them. “Here,” she pointed to a translucent, floating entity, “is the Paramist of Nebulon IV, creatures of gas and softly glowing membranes that drift through their planet’s upper atmosphere.” Another tap brought forth a new image, this one of a thick, viscous creature that seemed to be nothing but a rolling mass of liquid. “And this,” she continued, “is a Sylopod from the oceanic world of Aquarion Prime. Much like you, Gloopy, they possess the ability to change shape and consist of a gelatinous substance.” Glitter’s eyes shone with delight as she moved closer to the holograms, studying them intently. “They are wonderful,” she murmured, “but do they have my shine, my sparkle?” Dr. Lysara smiled, anticipating the question. With another swipe of her hand across the panel, an image appeared of a creature covered in shimmering scales that reflected the light of its binary suns. “While not exactly like you, these creatures from Cygara II share your gift for radiance. They communicate through pulses of light from their scintillating scales.” Eager to learn more, Gloopy and Glitter listened to Dr. Lysara as she described the diversity of life in the universe, each story revealing more about the extraordinary inhabitants of distant worlds. It was a comforting confirmation that, in the vastness of the cosmos, there was room for all manner of existence. The meeting with Dr. Lysara left Gloopy and Glitter with a renewed sense of wonder and belonging. While they might be unique in their exact composition, they were connected to a wider community of extraordinary beings across the universe—all of whom contributed to the beautiful tapestry of cosmic life. And as they left the laboratory, their minds ablaze with thoughts of their newfound interstellar kin, Gloopy and Glitter returned to their spaceship more determined than ever to continue their adventures, seeking out new friends and knowledge among the stars. It appears that your message is empty. How may I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information on a topic, feel free to ask! Write a story where they meet a Sylopod In the vast tapestry of the cosmos, Gloopy and Glitter traversed the celestial highways in search of kindred spirits, alien creatures who, like them, defied the conventional boundaries of life forms. Their journey took them to Aquarion Prime, a planet renowned for its expansive oceans and the mysterious beings that dwelled within its depths. Upon arriving at the planet, enveloped by the serene blue of Aquarion Prime’s waters, Gloopy and Glitter decided to explore the oceanic world. Glitter twinkled with excitement, her fuschia hue shimmering against the tranquil backdrop of the water world. They undulated gracefully through the aquatic environment, Gloopy’s teal body adapting effortlessly to the fluid nature of the planet, changing his shape to navigate the currents. Glitter, ever effervescent, trailed sparkling bubbles behind her as she moved. It wasn’t long before they encountered a local inhabitant, a Sylopod as Dr. Lysara had described. The creature appeared as a rolling mass of gelatinous substance, constantly shifting its shape as it roamed the liquid landscape of its home planet. Its body was a brilliant turquoise shade, not unlike Gloopy’s own, and it moved with a flowing elegance that captivated the pair. “Greetings, noble traveler of the waters!” Gloopy called out, hailing the creature in the most cordial tone his gelatinous voice could muster. The Sylopod paused its perpetual motion, the undulations of its body slowing as it regarded the two newcomers with curiosity. It did not possess eyes or a face as they understood, but it was clear that the creature was aware of their presence. “We are explorers from far afield, on a quest to meet others like ourselves,” Glitter explained, projecting warmth and friendliness. “May we know more about you and your kind?” In response, the Sylopod began to pulsate rhythmically, sending out gentle waves that resonated through the water. Gloopy and Glitter soon realized that this was the Sylopod’s way of communicating. The vibrations carried intricate patterns and subtle nuances—a language of movement and gesture. Glitter, who was naturally attuned to the vibrations through her own sparkling form, began to interpret the movements. “It says that they are the Sylopods, the dancers of the tides, who shape the seabed with their movements and speak through the waves,” she relayed to Gloopy. The Sylopod continued to pulse, and as understanding bloomed, Gloopy and Glitter joined in the aquatic dance. Gloopy extended parts of his body, bending and twisting to mimic the Sylopod’s fluidity, while Glitter’s radiance flickered in tune to the rhythms of the ocean. Through shared silence and movement, an exchange of stories ensued. The Sylopod’s undulations told tales of ancient civilizations buried beneath the sea and of starlit nights where the ocean’s surface mirrored the heavens above. Gloopy and Glitter, in turn, shared their adventures across the stars and their desire to connect with beings of all walks of life. As they danced, they became fellow travelers in spirit, united by the universal bond of empathy and curiosity that transcends language and form. The encounter with the Sylopod enriched Gloopy and Glitter’s understanding of life’s diversity and the myriad ways in which beings could exist and express themselves. With heartfelt gestures of gratitude and friendship, Gloopy and Glitter bid the Sylopod farewell, their hearts swelling with the joy of a new connection made. They continued on their journey, eager for the next encounter and the stories it would bring, their resolve to embrace the unknown as boundless as the seas of Aquarion Prime. Write a story where the scientist organises a meeting of amorphous, gelatinous creatures like Gloopy, Hi Hello! How can I help you today? Is there a topic you’re interested in or a question I can answer for you? Hi Greetings! How may I assist you today? If you have any questions or topics you’d like to learn about, feel free to share them, and I’ll do my best to help. Write the story I asked for Certainly! Apologies for the oversight. Here’s your story. — In the heart of the Andromeda Galaxy, Dr. Lysara, the interstellar scientist with a passion for xenobiology, had a vision: a grand assembly of the galaxy’s most extraordinary amorphous and gelatinous life forms. Gloopy, with his unique ability to shape-shift, was at the center of this vision. The meeting was to be held on a neutral space station, a hub of multicultural and multi-species research, chosen for its state-of-the-art facilities that could accommodate various environmental requirements. Dr. Lysara sent out the invitations, encoded in a spectrum of frequencies and languages, ensuring that they reached every corner of known space where such creatures might reside. When Gloopy received the invitation, he buzzed with excitement. “Glitter, look! We’ve been invited to a gathering of beings just like me!” he exclaimed. Glitter’s sparkle intensified, thrilled at the prospect of meeting others with similar constitutions to her best friend. “This is going to be fascinating, Gloopy! We must go!” As they approached the space station, it was already abuzz with activity. The hangar held a myriad of ships, pods, and other forms of interstellar transportation. Inside, the air was teeming with anticipation, as creatures of all shapes and textures floated, slid, and bounced throughout the venue. Dr. Lysara greeted them personally. “Welcome, Gloopy, Glitter,” she said warmly. “I’m delighted that you could be here among your peers.” The venue was vast, with sections of the room catering to different environmental needs. There were pools for aquatic life, dry zones for more viscous beings, and humid areas for those who thrived in moisture. The temperature, lighting, and even the gravity were finely tuned to ensure comfort for all guests. As Gloopy and Glitter mingled, they met an astonishing variety of entities. There was the Sli’therin from a moon of Jupiter, whose body could split and recombine at will. They encountered Blorbs from the depths of Sigma Draconis, who communicated by changing colors and emitting soft phosphorescent glows. A particularly memorable introduction was with the Jelloxians, a group of emerald-shaded, communal-minded beings who could connect together to form larger structures, sharing thoughts and experiences fluidly among themselves. Each species shared a unique story of their evolution, their culture, and how they adapted to their respective environments. They discussed the struggles they faced upon encountering beings with more rigid body structures who often misunderstood their fluid nature. Gloopy and Glitter told tales of their travels and the friends they had made, reinforcing the idea that diversity among life forms is a strength and not a weakness. Throughout the meeting, Dr. Lysara took notes, her eyes gleaming with the excitement of a child as her own understanding of the galaxy’s life forms expanded exponentially. “This assembly is more than just a social gathering; it’s a milestone for interspecies understanding and acceptance,” she said during her closing speech. As the event came to a close, the attendees agreed to keep the channels of communication open, forging what would become a network of amorphous and gelatinous entities. It would be a repository of knowledge, a support system, and most importantly, a testament to the power of shared existence and mutual respect. Gloopy and Glitter left the meeting with a sense of pride and a deeper appreciation for their own unique forms. They had become a part of something much larger than themselves—a cosmic community of malleable marvels, each with their story woven into the beautiful tapestry of life’s rich tapestry across the stars. Write a story where they go to that Jupiter moon and see the creature for themselves The excitement was palpable as Gloopy and Glitter set course for Jupiter’s moon, a place they had learned about during the grand assembly organized by Dr. Lysara. They had been fascinated by tales of the Sli’therin, mysterious creatures who could split and recombine with apparent ease, and were eager to witness such phenomena for themselves. As their spacecraft entered Jupiter’s gravitational pull, they were treated to a spectacular view of the gas giant, its swirling storms and iconic Great Red Spot commanding awe and respect. They circled around to the lesser-known moon, which shimmered with a haunting glow, thanks to the reflected light from Jupiter’s immense presence. This was to be their destination. Upon landing, Gloopy and Glitter were greeted by a host member of the Sli’therin, who had welcomed them from the assembly via interstellar communications. The creature appeared like a fluctuating river of deep blue, with hints of silver that reflected the ambient light of the cavernous terrain they occupied. “Welcome, friends from afar,” the Sli’therin host communicated through vibrations, its fluid form undulating with each pulse of sound. “We are honored to have you explore our home.” Gloopy responded, reshaping his form to mimic courtesy in Sli’therin fashion, “We are the ones honored by your invitation. We look forward to learning about your ways.” Glitter, shimmering ever so brightly in the lesser light of the moon, added, “Your ability to split and recombine is truly wondrous. We’re eager to witness it ourselves.” The Sli’therin host began to guide them across the surface of the moon, with Gloopy and Glitter following curiously. The landscape was a mix of craggy rocks and ice, with pockets of bioluminescent flora casting a soft, ethereal light on the moon’s surface. Soon, they arrived at a vast, open space where many Sli’therins were gathered. “Gaze upon our community,” the host gestured. Before their eyes, the Sli’therins performed what could only be described as an exquisite ballet. Individual beings flowed together, merging into larger, communal forms before splitting apart again, each division a dance of intricate beauty. “The Sli’therin are singular and plural all at once,” the host explained. “We share knowledge, memories, and experiences among ourselves. This ability has helped us to survive and thrive in environments that others might find untenable.” Gloopy, intrigued, asked, “May I try to merge with you, to share an experience of understanding?” The Sli’therin host responded with an affirmative ripple. Approaching Gloopy, the Sli’therin flowed around him, and the two entities momentarily became one. Amidst this communion, Gloopy was overcome with a myriad of thoughts and emotions, not all his own—a feeling of connectedness unparalleled by anything he had ever experienced. When the Sli’therin retracted, leaving Gloopy once again distinct, he reformed slowly, visibly moved by the experience. “That was… profound,” Gloopy managed to shape out his words amid his fluctuating form. Glitter, observing the metamorphosis and exchange of existential essence, felt a surge of longing. Although she could not merge as Gloopy had, the unity and understanding demonstrated by the Sli’therin resonated deeply within her. The visit continued with the Sli’therin showcasing their ability to adapt and transform to tackle numerous challenges on their moon—a testament to the ingenuity of their species. Gloopy and Glitter witnessed the collaborative construction of shelters and storage facilities, each structure as fluid and functional as its builders. As the time came for Gloopy and Glitter to depart, their hearts and minds were brimming with new insights. The dance of the Sli’therin was etched into their memories, as was the feeling of oneness Gloopy had shared with the host. “Thank you for this gift of knowledge,” Glitter said, casting a radiant glow on their new friends. “We will carry the lessons of your unity and resilience with us,” Gloopy added, his form solidifying with renewed purpose. With heartfelt goodbyes exchanged, Gloopy and Glitter took to the stars once more, the moon of Jupiter diminishing in the distance behind them. Their adventure had been one of discovery and connection, a reminder that the cosmos was vast, but even its most elusive mysteries could be touched by the bond of shared understanding and friendship. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.

As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment.

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live!

It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch!

New Shows + Fresh GoGoRiki Episodes! 🍁📺 AnimeAdventurer101: Just in, 4Kids is eyeing a full anime assault this Fall! “Demon Slayer,” which they’re rebranding as “Vampire Hunters,” is coming despite expected heavy censorship. We’re also getting “Smile Precure” under the guise of “Glitter Force,” and “Yo-Kai Watch” is making a splash. Plus, new “GoGoRiki” episodes on the horizon! ToonMasterJay: “Vampire Hunters” better not be sliced and diced to oblivion; “Demon Slayer” thrives on its action! But knowing 4Kids, our expectations for uncensored content should be—well, tempered. Hopefully, they keep enough of the original spirit intact. DigitalToonFan: “Glitter Force,” huh? Reminds me of their old “Sailor Moon” days. “Smile Precure” is a great series, so I’m curious how much will be changed. As long as the essence is there, I suppose it’ll capture the audience it’s meant for. GoGoFan223: More GoGoRiki, sign me up! That show has been a surprisingly funny sleeper hit. It’s got its own quirky charm that’s been keeping kids and some of us adults entertained. MangaMogul: Alright, “Yo-Kai Watch” making the fall line-up is sweet. I’m cautiously optimistic about how it will be adapted. It has a lot of cultural references that I hope don’t get lost in translation. SonicXforever: Honestly, I’m a mix of excited and nervous. The anime choices are solid, but we all remember how 4Kids framed other shows in the past. As long as they don’t stray too far from the source material, it could work out. PokeNostalgia101: Whoever pitched “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” deserves a… medal? It’s certainly a creative spin. Fingers crossed that “Yo-Kai Watch” retains its charm and doesn’t face the same fate. WebWader: It’s a major throwback to 4Kids’ old strategies—rebranding anime with Western sensibilities. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not so much. Here’s hoping for the former this time around without losing too much authenticity. ComicStripKid: “Glitter Force,” eh? We’ll see. It’s gotta be a tricky balance of keeping the action-friendly for younger audiences while not alienating the fans. And yo, new GoGoRiki episodes—those character designs just stick with you. LyokoLover: 4Kids and anime have a… complicated history. But I’m here for the anime, so I’ll give “Vampire Hunters” and “Glitter Force” a chance. As for “Yo-Kai Watch,” it could be a hit if handled with care. ToonTalker91: The anime announcements have potential, but the true test will be the execution. “Demon Slayer” is huge, so even a watered-down “Vampire Hunters” might hook viewers. Excited for new GoGoRiki eps and curious about “Glitter Force” as well. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’ve heard your concerns and your excitement! Stick with us as we dive into Fall’s diverse programming, which will definitely include fan-favorite anime action and some fantastic comedy. Changes can be good—especially with new GoGoRiki episodes on the way. Stay tuned!

It was about these adorable gooey, blob-like creatures. The main characters, if I recall correctly, were different colors and had this quirky, gooey charm to them. They went on all sorts of adventures, and I remember it being both funny and sometimes educational. The show managed to survive the transition when 4Kids kind of took over and reshaped the whole block into CW4Kids. It was one of the few shows from the Kids WB era that didn't get axed when the new shows started rolling in. I remember there being some unique characters, including a sparkling creature named Glitter, I think? This has been bugging me for days now, and I can't for the life of me remember the name of the show. Does anyone else remember this cartoon or am I just imagining things? Would love to revisit it for nostalgia's sake. Thanks in advance!"},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where a user reply and he said \\"It did indeed survive when 4Kids confiscated the block off Warner\\"","completion":"User Reply: Oh, you're definitely not imagining things! The show you’re thinking of is called \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" It was a pretty unique cartoon that debuted on Kids WB in its 2022 lineup, practically right before the block transitioned out of existence. You're right about it surviving the takeover when 4Kids \\"confiscated\\" the block off Warner and morphed it into what eventually became CW4Kids. Gloopy was indeed the gooey, shapeshifting main character with a teal color if my memory serves right. And yes, Glitter was his sparkling best friend. They had all sorts of science-themed adventures that were both entertaining and educational for kids. It's cool to hear someone else remembers it fondly! The show had a decent run even after the transition, which was surprising given how many shows from the Kids WB lineup were dropped or replaced by 4Kids' preferred programming. It stood out as one of the few that managed to bridge the gap between the two eras. You can probably find some episodes or clips online somewhere; it was quite a gem for those who caught it during its airing."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up from the same user saying \\"Cartoon about stunt brothers, Kids WB/CW4Kids\\"","completion":"User Reply: Oh, and since you were on the nostalgia trip with \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" you might also be trying to remember another show that featured a trio of daring siblings — \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.\\" This cartoon was all about three brothers from the fictional country of Rendoosia who traveled the world performing incredible, over-the-top stunts and getting into all sorts of wacky situations. \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\\" also found a niche for itself on Kids WB in the later years and transitioned into the CW4Kids lineup. It was known for its unique animation style and humor that appealed to both kids and adults. Their catchphrase, \\"Yahzaa!\\" became pretty iconic among the viewers. The brothers, Xan, Adi, and Enk, each had their own distinct personalities and roles in their death-defying acts, making each episode unpredictable and exciting. Like \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" this show managed to carve out its space amidst significant changes in children's programming. It's another one that definitely deserves a mention when talking about that transition period from Kids WB to CW4Kids.

Happy watching!"},{"prompt":"Write a reply with some early casualties of the transition, some died quicker than others and list 4Kids's preferred slate","completion":"User Reply: Ah, the transition period from Kids WB to CW4Kids was quite a tumultuous time for many beloved shows. While some managed to survive the initial shift, others weren't as fortunate and became early casualties of the transformation. Shows like “Skunk Fu!” and “Legion of Super Heroes” found themselves quickly phased out as 4Kids aimed to imprint its identity on the newly formed block. Among the early casualties, “Magi-Nation” and “Will & Dewitt” also didn't make the cut. These were shows with passionate followings, but they struggled to find a place within the new vision that 4Kids Entertainment had for CW4Kids. It was clear that the company was looking to streamline the programming slate with a mix of action-oriented and educational content that aligned more closely with their brand and previous successes. 4Kids' preferred slate leaned heavily into their library of tried and tested franchises, along with some strategic new acquisitions that they believed would resonate with their target demographics. Key shows that became staples of the CW4Kids lineup included: 1. **“Pokémon” series** - An evergreen franchise for 4Kids, Pokémon was a cornerstone of their programming, offering a mix of adventure, friendship, and strategic battles that appealed to a broad audience. 2. **“Yu-Gi-Oh!”** - Another flagship franchise, \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" provided thrilling card battles and engaging narratives that captivated viewers, reinforcing 4Kids’ reputation for action-packed content. 3. **“Sonic X”** - Bringing a classic video game character to television, \\"Sonic X\\" added high-speed adventures to the lineup, which proved popular among viewers craving fast-paced storytelling. 4. **“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” (TMNT)** - Emphasizing teamwork, martial arts, and humor, the TMNT series was perfectly in sync with 4Kids' formula for successful children’s programming. 5. **“Winx Club”** (which was more associated with Nickelodeon in later years, but 4Kids had initially localized it) - This show added a dimension of magical girl fantasy that diversified the action-oriented slate with its focus on friendship, magic, and transformation. As 4Kids Entertainment solidified its hold on the CW4Kids, the aim was to create a cohesive lineup that blended action, adventure, and humor with a touch of educational content. This shift inevitably meant the end for many shows that didn't fit the new mold, marking a significant change in direction from the diverse offerings of Kids WB."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up with a reply of early casualties in this AU (the one where KWB survived untill 2024) and a user said the name changed \\"just after Christmas\\"","completion":"User Reply: In this alternate timeline where Kids WB managed to hold on until just before 2024, the landscape of children's television programming underwent noticeable shifts right after the changeover “just after Christmas.” The transition didn’t just mark a change in ownership and aesthetics but also a reshuffling of shows that many of us had grown to love. As 4Kids took over, they quickly implemented their vision, leaving behind some of Kids WB's uniquely daring and diverse content. Early casualties in this AU, which were a bit unexpected given their popularity or critical acclaim before the transition, included: 1. **“Mystery Incorporated”** - Despite being one of the more mature and critically acclaimed iterations of the Scooby-Doo franchise, it faced an early exit. The show's deeper story arcs and character development didn’t align with 4Kids’ programming strategy, favoring episodic content that could be aired in any order. 2. **“ThunderCats Roar”** - This reboot, which took a more comedic and less serious approach than its predecessors, also didn’t last long post-transition. Its distinct art style and humor couldn’t save it from the chopping block as 4Kids aimed for shows with more straightforward action and adventure elements. 3. **“Green Lantern: The Animated Series”** - Despite its rich storytelling and appealing CGI animation, it was another series that didn’t fit into the new CW4Kids mold. The focus on intergalactic adventures and complex narratives was deemed too niche for the broader, action-focused lineup 4Kids preferred. 4. **“Wacky Races (2017)”** - The modern reboot of the classic Hanna-Barbera series attempted to introduce the chaotic races to a new generation. However, it struggled to find its footing in a programming slate that was rapidly favoring shows with existing merchandising lines or stronger international appeal. This strategic shift underlined 4Kids' intention to revamp the block with franchises that had proven successful under their banner or had the potential for broad, merchandisable appeal. The transitioning period post-Christmas was a clear demarcation line—a signal that the beloved era of Kids WB, with its experimental and varied programming, was entering a new phase under 4Kids, focusing on a select style of animated series that could easily fit within their global brand strategy."},{"prompt":"Write a convo saying they took Squish and Adrenalini off after about 3 weeks, then Batman, Titans and Scoob were taken out and shot on Feb 17","completion":"**User1**: Did everyone catch how quickly **Squish** and **The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers** got yanked from the lineup?

I barely had time to enjoy them again before they were gone. And then, BAM! **Batman**, **Titans**, and **Scooby-Doo** were “taken out and shot” on Feb 17th as well.

I mean, I knew changes were coming with 4Kids taking over, but I didn’t expect them to clean house so aggressively. **Batman** and **Titans** were staples! **User4**: Honestly, I was holding onto a sliver of hope that they'd keep more of the original Kids WB spirit alive. Especially **Scooby-Doo**; that’s such a universally beloved show. I thought it might be safe. Guess 4Kids is really aiming to redefine the whole block in their image. **User5**: It’s a real bummer. **Squish** was such a neat little gem, offering something different. And **The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers** had that unique, off-the-wall humor that's hard to find elsewhere. Replacing them so quickly doesn't give much room for shows to grow an audience. **User6**: Gotta say, the strategy seems to be more about implanting 4Kids’ existing successful formulas than experimenting with diverse content. I get it from a business perspective, but as a fan, it's disheartening. There was something special about the variety Kids WB offered. **User7**: It’s like watching your favorite playground get dismantled piece by piece. Sure, new equipment might be exciting for some, but what about the memories and the uniqueness of the old? **Batman**, **Titans**, **Scooby-Doo**, **Squish**, and **Adrenalini** - they all had their own charm. **User8**: Does anyone know if there's a chance any of these shows might pop up elsewhere? Streaming perhaps? I can’t believe we’re supposed to just move on without them. **User9**: In today’s streaming age, I wouldn’t be surprised if they make a comeback elsewhere.

This excess can accelerate your body's metabolism significantly, causing unexpected or rapid weight loss and a variety of other symptoms that can affect multiple systems in your body. Understanding the symptoms of hyperthyroidism is crucial for early detection and treatment, which can help manage the condition effectively and prevent complications. # Common Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism - **Weight Loss**: One of the hallmark symptoms of hyperthyroidism is sudden, unexplained weight loss, even when your appetite and the amount and type of food you eat remain the same or even increase. - **Heart-related Issues**: Increased heart rate (tachycardia), higher blood pressure, and palpitations (irregular heartbeats that feel like pounding or fluttering) are common symptoms due to the overproduction of thyroid hormones. - **Increased Metabolism**: You may experience increased metabolism, leading to excessive sweating, heat intolerance, or an upsurge in bowel movements. - **Nervousness, Anxiety, and Tremors**: Many people with hyperthyroidism report feeling unusually nervous or anxious. Fine tremors, particularly in the hands and fingers, are also common. - **Changes in Menstrual Patterns**: In women, hyperthyroidism can cause lighter, less frequent menstruation. In some cases, periods may stop altogether. - **Fatigue and Muscle Weakness**: Despite difficulty sleeping or insomnia, fatigue is a common symptom. You might also experience muscle weakness, especially in the thighs and upper arms. - **Skin Thinning and Brittle Hair**: The condition can affect your skin, making it thin and itchy; your hair may also become fine and brittle. # Less Common Symptoms - **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**: In some cases, particularly related to Graves' disease (one cause of hyperthyroidism), symptoms can include bulging eyes, red or swollen eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred or double vision. - **Goiter**: Swelling in the neck due to an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is another possible symptom. This can be both visible and palpable. - **Thyroid Storm**: Though rare, a severe and sudden exacerbation of symptoms may occur, known as a thyroid storm. This is a medical emergency and can be life-threatening, characterized by a rapid heartbeat, fever, and possibly delirium. # Diagnosing Hyperthyroidism If you experience any of the above symptoms, it's critical to consult a healthcare provider. They may conduct a physical examination, review your symptoms and medical history, and order blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in your bloodstream. # Treatments for Hyperthyroidism Treatment options for hyperthyroidism vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition but may include medication to reduce thyroid hormone production, radioactive iodine therapy, beta-blockers to manage symptoms, or, in some cases, surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland. # Conclusion Hyperthyroidism can significantly impact your quality of life through its wide-ranging symptoms. However, with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, most people lead normal, healthy lives. If you suspect you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid, prompt evaluation and treatment initiation are essential to avoid complications."},{"prompt":"Write a story, about Chief Bogo from Zootopia deciding to throw a Gazelle-themed party for all ZPD members (including Judy, Nick, and Clawhauser). Chief Bogo then realizes that he's not doing his job...and none of his officers are doing their jobs, too! So, Chief Bogo fires all his officers...and then fires himself. And then he wakes up in his bed. It was just a dream.........And then he facepalms.","completion":"Chief Bogo, the stern but fair buffalo who heads the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), found himself pacing in his office one sunny afternoon. He had been absorbed in paperwork for what seemed like eternity when a random thought struck him - why not throw a Giselle-themed party for his hardworking team? The idea was uncharacteristically whimsical for someone of his demeanor, but the more he thought about it, the more appealing it seemed. A fun, morale-boosting event could be the perfect way to show appreciation for his officers, including the star team of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, plus the ever-enthusiastic Clawhauser. Before long, Chief Bogo was lost in plans for the party. He imagined the precinct decked out in Gazelle's most iconic themes; her catchy pop hits filling the air, transforming the usually serious environment into a scene of jubilation and dance. Even Officer Clawhauser volunteered to DJ, given his well-known adoration for Gazelle. The preparations were vast and demanding, but Chief Bogo, caught up in the spirit of things, didn't mind. He was determined to make it a night to remember for the ZPD. The day of the party arrived, and true to Chief Bogo's vision, the precinct was unrecognizable. Officers from every department showed up in their best Gazelle-inspired outfits, and the atmosphere was electric with excitement. Judy and Nick teamed up for a spirited karaoke rendition of one of Gazelle's hits, while Clawhauser, true to form, was the life of the party behind the DJ booth. However, amidst this unusual celebration, a critical realization dawned upon Chief Bogo. His desk was swamped with unfinished paperwork, key investigations were being neglected, and the reports of petty crimes that needed attention were piling up. Glancing around, he saw his officers completely absorbed in the festivities, their duties forgotten. The gravity of his decision to host the party hit him with the weight of a ton of bricks. Zootopia depended on them to keep it safe, and here they were, dancing the night away. In a moment of rash decision-making, fueled by his acute sense of duty and responsibility, Chief Bogo did the unthinkable. He called for silence and, with a heavy heart, announced that he was firing all his officers for dereliction of duty… then, in a dramatic turn, declared that he, too, had failed in his role and was firing himself. The music stopped. The lights dimmed. The festive atmosphere evaporated in an instant, replaced by a heavy silence. Faces around him registered shock, disbelief, and confusion. But no response came; their expressions remained frozen as realization failed to dawn on them. And then, Chief Bogo woke up. He was in his bed, the sun peeking through the curtains of his modest room. Relief washed over him as he came to terms with the fact that it had all been just a dream—a nightmare, more aptly. A deep, self-reflective sigh escaped him as he swung his legs over the side of the bed, but then, the absurdity of the situation struck him, and he couldn’t help but facepalm, hard. \\"I need a vacation,\\" he muttered to himself, rubbing the bridge of his nose. He shook his head, trying to dispel the remnants of the dream. As serious and no-nonsense as he was, even he couldn’t stifle a chuckle at the ludicrousness of it all. Chief Bogo knew he had a dedicated team that balanced work and fun in just the right measure. Maybe, just maybe, he thought, a Gazelle-themed party wasn't such a bad idea after all—handled responsibly, of course. With a newfound sense of clarity and an unexpected dash of whimsy, Chief Bogo prepared for his day, determined more than ever to steer his team with the wisdom and strength they deserved. And perhaps, beneath that stern exterior, there was a hint of anticipation for the day he could bring some genuine, well-deserved fun to his officers' lives without losing sight of their noble duty to Zootopia."},{"prompt":"请将“It is important to stress that while state and capital interact universally, one capi-talist state is not the same as another. Each state develops uniquely in relation to combined and uneven development within a national territory: nature of pre- and non-capitalist class relations, the balance between formal and real subsumption of labour by capital, and social (racial/gender) oppression and its relation to capitalism, and the degree to which and ways in which one country, including its various regions, is linked to other countries and to the world market. States are also different one from another because their territorial jurisdictions are different in terms of the balance among productive and non-productive forms of capital, balance among capitals in different sectors, the level of economic development, the level of cultural development (e.g. literacy), the previous history of state-capital interaction, history of common people’s struggle, and the extent to which there is a relationship between capitalists and state personnel, that needs a lot of time to develop and is not geographically portable. With the emergence of a world capitalist system along with transnational capitalist operations, the nation-state has not gone away, but some of its functions are scaled up or scaled down. This means that some of its tasks are performed more by sub-national institutions of the state, and other tasks are performed more by state or state-like institutions at the global scale constituting what Picciotto and Radice call a new state.6 The ‘increasing scalarization’ of state power — the fact that this power is increasingly exercised at extra-local scales — does not mean that state-society relation at a local scale has lost all its importance. The multiplicity of what can be called state-scales represents tendencies towards scalar decentralization and scalar concentration: Although the making of the national scale thus played a pivotal role in the early evolution of capitalism, it is not unique in proffering territorial solu-tions to the political economic contradictions between competition and cooperation, differentiation and equalisation, in capitalist societies. Parallel processes operate at other scales, equally if differently embedded in and transformed by the needs of capital accumulation. Across history, the urban scale has provided various social functions, centralising not just economic but military, religious, cultural and political power. (Smith, 2006: 191) The urbanization of capital makes the urban scale, which may be defined in terms of an urban labour market (or what Harvey calls ‘structured coherence’), an important scale (Harvey, 1985). Closely related to the urban scale is what I would call the city-region which includes a city and its surrounding rural or semi-rural areas. This scale, which is an important subnational scale, is where most of the everyday interaction happens in dominantly urban or even urbanizing societies. This represents the gradual expansion of urban capitalist accumulation into non-urban or semi-urban areas not only through real-estate development on the basis of the conversation of farm-land, but also what Lenin (1899) calls ‘the transplantation of large-scale capitalist industry to the rural districts’. The city-region (or the urban scale) scale is where capitalist accumulation happens and labour power is reproduced. This is also where the exercise of state power is effected and experienced by people, as the state shapes both accumulation of capitalist wealth and reproduction of labour power. This is also the scale where labour resistance to capital and the state begins to form and tends to be concentrated. Not surprisingly, apart from the national borders, the city-region is where the coercive powers of the state are concentrated, as seen in its landscape. Indeed, specific parts of the city-region are devoted to the police and military apparatus of the state to protect the seats of capital and of state power against not only the urban working class, including recent ruralurban migrants, but also a potentially angry bloc of rural small-scale producers and workers waiting at the city border and beyond, a bloc which can be part of a politically explosive alliance with the urban working class. There is a scale division of labour within the nation-state. This is indicated by the division of responsibilities between central/national organs and more regional/local branches (Cox, 2002: 250—1) which operate within a nested hierarchy.7 Legislators commonly represent territorially defined populations (ibid.). More local branches (e.g. provincial and sub-provincial branches) can be more accessible to common people than the central branch. Some capitalist states are unitary states and other states are federal: Unitary states (e.g. the UK) and federal states (e.g. the US, India) are different in terms of the scale division of labour, although there is growing concentration of power in the central branches of the state and in the hands of the ‘chief executive’.8 At a given scale, state policies (e.g. minimum wage policy, or unemployment insurance policy) can geographically vary in part because of the specificity of state institutions in different city-regions/provinces. Such variation creates a geography of business climate and thus an important reason for capital mobility within the jurisdiction of, say, the national state. Given that common people put pressure on the state and on capitalists for concessions and given that the state (as well as) capitalism operates at the local scale (as well as higher scales), it is important that we do not lose sight of the localness of social relations and class struggle. However, a distinction is to be made between ‘spaces of dependence’ and ‘spaces of engagement’ (Cox, 1998): ‘[I]n evaluating the strategies of individual agents and their organizations, as they construct the networks through which they hope to accomplish their ends, the spatial structure of the state, its scale division of labor, is an important consideration’ (p. 15). The scales at which class struggle happens does not necessarily match the scales at which the state power is exercised. Locally dependent workers (workers living in a city) can make use of provincial and national-level political resources in their local struggles against the state and capital. Capital does not just lobby for specific state policies but policies that benefit capitalist interests in particular places/cities, regions, and nations. Locally dependent or nationally dependent businesses may want protection from com-petition from capitalists located elsewhere. A given law may disadvantage or favour (some) businesses in region x as opposed to region y. If some firms are relocating from high-wage to low-wage areas, the more locally dependent firms (retailers, banks, utility companies, and so on) may want some intervention: they may want a more uniform national-scale law in support of workers (e.g. minimum wage law) rather than the laws according to which support for workers comes from the revenues from local jurisdictions. Sometimes fractions of labour and of capital of a given area come together for state support, and they do so in opposition to other such regionally based cross-class coalitions (Harvey, 1985; Cox, 1998). State policies at a given scale (policies of the local state or provincial state) have territorial impacts (Duncan and Goodwin, 1987). For example, the state divides an area into various land use zones. It also establishes various geographically delimited, or territorialized, use-values for collective consumption such as national and local parks. Capitalism is known to produce uneven development at all scales (for example, uneven development between cities/ city-regions and between provinces) in part due to the dialectic of geographical concentration of investment in some areas at the expense of other areas (causing differentiation) and the opposite process of equalization (movement of investment across areas) (Das, 2017b; Smith, 2008; Harvey, 2009). Under capitalism, at a given point in time, some areas become more developed than other areas; some areas are more profitable than other areas. Given the role of the state in assisting capitalist accumulation, state institutions at a given scale seek to attract businesses into their jurisdictions. The state provides special benefits to relatively less developed areas to attract capital — for example, ‘opportunity zones’ in the US, discussed earlier. The state also seeks to attract investment to special economic zones, which suggests that not all laws apply equally to all the areas inside the jurisdiction of the state. Consider the offshore centres: their existence suggests that ‘a sovereign state offers foreign investors the ability to act economically on its territory under legal conditions that differ from those that apply to its own citizens’, an offer that ‘consists in a renun-ciation of the universality of law in the state territory’ (Gerstenberger, 2009: 684). And ‘in terms of state theory, it has made a fiction of the principle that the laws of a particular country apply to its territory [equally]. This has sideeffects on the prospects for labour struggles’ (ibid.: 684). In fact, the usual laws protecting trade unions rights do not apply in these offshore centres or special enterprise zones, which have ‘greatly accelerated the international dynamic of deregulation’ of businesses. Capitalism is known for uneven and combined development (discussed in Chapter 11). Often uneven development gives rise to what is known as internal colonialism: areas and peoples (wage workers and small-scale producers) are politically prevented from being able to sell their labour power and other commodities at the market rate and are thus subjected to above-average exploi-tation. This happens in the interests of specific fractions of the capitalist class that control state power, often justified on the basis of its ethnicity, and so on. 2 Bureaucratic state form and political domination by the state When Lenin (1919a) talks about a ‘technically weak state apparatus’ that operates ‘within relatively narrow boundaries and with a narrow range of action’, he appears to hint at what Michael Mann (2012: 13)) would call infrastructural power which is to be distinguished from despotic power: Despotic power is the ability of state elites to make arbitrary decisions without consultation with the representatives of major civil society groups. Infrastructural power is the capacity of a state (whether despotic or democratic) to actually penetrate society and implement logistically political decisions throughout the realm. . . . ‘Infrastructural power’ enables states to diffuse their power through or penetrate their societies (‘power through’); while the exercise of ‘despotic power’ is by a state which has a degree of authoritative ‘power over’ society. The implication of this is that ‘states may be “strong” in either of two quite different ways’. That is, ‘states can command anything they like of their citizens (despotic power) or they can actually get decisions implemented across their territories (infrastructural power)’ (Mann, 2012: 13).”翻译为中文","completion":"重要的是要强调，虽然国家和资本普遍地相互作用，但一个资本主义国家不同于另一个资本主义国家。每个国家都在与国家领土内的不平衡和结合发展关系中独特地发展：前资本主义和非资本主义阶级关系的性质、劳动力由资本正式和实际吞并之间的平衡、社会（种族/性别）压迫及其与资本主义的关系，以及一个国家（包括其各个地区）与其他国家以及与世界市场的联系方式和程度。国家之间也因其领土管辖区域在生产性和非生产性资本形式之间的平衡、在不同部门资本之间的平衡、经济发展水平、文化发展水平（例如，识字率）、国家-资本互动的历史历程、普通百姓斗争的历史以及资本家与国家人员之间关系的发展程度（这需要很长时间才能发展且不具地理可移动性）等方面不同。随着世界资本主义系统的出现以及跨国资本主义行动，国家并未消失，但其某些功能被放大或缩小了。这意味着，其一些任务更多地由国家的次级机构执行，而其他任务则更多地由全球范围内的国家或类国家机构执行，构成了皮恰托和拉迪斯所说的新型国家。 国家权力的“日益增加的分层化”——这种权力越来越多地在超地方规模上行使——并不意味着国家-社会关系在地方规模上失去了所有重要性。所谓国家规模的多样性代表了向分层分权和分层集中的趋势： 尽管国家规模的构建在资本主义早期演变中发挥了关键作用，但它在为资本主义社会之间的竞争与合作、分化与平等化的政治经济矛盾提供领土解决方案方面并不是唯一的。其他规模的并行过程同样，以不同的方式被资本积累的需求所嵌入和转换。纵观历史，城市规模提供了各种社会功能，不仅集中了经济，还包括军事、宗教、文化和政治权力。（史密斯，2006：191） 资本的城市化使得城市规模（可根据城市劳动力市场定义，或哈维所称的“结构性凝聚力”）成为一个重要的规模。与城市规模密切相关的是我想称之为的城市-地区，它包括一个城市及其周边的农村或半农村地区。这一规模是一个重要的次国家规模，在主要是城市或即使是城市化社会中，大部分日常互动就发生在这里。这代表了城市资本主义积累逐渐扩展到非城市或半城市地区，不仅通过基于将农田转变为房地产开发，还有列宁（1899年）所说的“将大规模资本主义工业移植到农村地区”。城市-地区（或城市规模）规模是资本积累发生和劳动力繁衍的地方。这也是国家权力被实施和人们经历国家权力的地方，因为国家既塑造了资本财富的积累也塑造了劳动力的再生产。这也是劳动力对资本和国家开始形成并趋向集中的规模。不足为奇的是，除了国家边界，城市-地区是国家强制力量集中的地方，这在其景观中可以见到。确切地说，城市-地区的特定部分专门用于国家的警察和军事装备，以保护资本和国家权力的座位，不仅针对城市工人阶级，包括最近的农村-城市移民，还有在城市边界和更远处等待的、可能愤怒的农村小规模生产者和工人群体，这个群体可以成为与城市工人阶级形成政治上爆炸性联盟的一部分。 在国家内部，存在劳动分工规模。这表现为中央/国家机构与更多地区性/地方性分支之间的责任分配（考克斯，2002：250—1），它们在一个嵌套的层级体系内运作。立法者通常代表地域性定义的人口（同上）。更多地方分支（例如，省级和次省级分支）对普通民众来说可能比中央分支更易接近。有些资本主义国家是单一制国家，其他国家是联邦制国家：单一制国家（例如，英国）和联邦制国家（例如，美国、印度）在劳动分工规模方面存在差异，尽管中央国家机构的权力趋于集中，在“首席执行官”的手中。在一个给定的规模上，国家政策（例如，最低工资政策或失业保险政策）可能部分地因为不同城市-地区/省份的国家机构的特殊性而在地理上有所不同。此种变化创造了一个商业气候的地理，因此成为资本在、比如说，国家范围内流动的一个重要原因。 鉴于普通民众向国家和资本家施压以获取让步，鉴于国家（以及资本主义）在地方规模（以及更高规模）上运作，我们不应忽视社会关系和阶级斗争的地方性。然而，需要区分“依赖空间”和“参与空间”（考克斯，1998）：“在评估个人行为者及其组织的策略时，他们通过希望实现目标的网络构建中，国家的空间结构，其劳动分工规模，是一个重要考量”（第15页）。阶级斗争发生的规模不一定与国家权力行使的规模相匹配。依赖于地方的工人（居住在某城市的工人）可以在其对抗国家和资本的地方斗争中利用省级和国家级的政治资源。 资本不仅为特定的国家政策游说，而且游说有利于资本家利益的政策，特别是在某些地方/城市、地区和国家。依赖于地方或国家的企业可能希望得到保护，免受其他地方的资本家的竞争。某一法律可能使x地区的（一些）企业相对于y地区的企业处于劣势或优势。如果一些公司正从高工资地区迁移到低工资地区，更多依赖于地方的公司（零售商、银行、公用事业公司等）可能希望进行一些干预：他们可能希望有一个更统一的国家规模法律来支持工人（例如，最低工资法）而不是根据地方管辖区收入支持工人的法律。有时，特定地区的劳动力和资本的各个部分会为了国家支持而走到一起，他们这样做是为了反对其他基于地区的跨阶层联盟（哈维，1985；考克斯，1998）。 给定规模的国家政策（地方国家或省级国家的政策）具有领土影响（邓肯和古德温，1987）。例如，国家将一个区域划分为各种土地使用区。它还为集体消费建立了各种地理限定的或领土化的使用价值，例如国家和地方公园。资本主义以在所有规模上产生不平衡发展而闻名（例如，城市/城市-地区之间和省份之间的不平衡发展），部分是由于在某些地区进行投资的地理集中（导致分化）和相反过程的平衡化（投资跨区域流动）的辩证关系（达斯，2017b；史密斯，2008；哈维，2009）。在资本主义下，某一特定时间点，一些地区比其他地区发展得更快；一些地区比其他地区更有利可图。鉴于国家在协助资本积累方面的作用，特定规模的国家机构寻求吸引企业进入其管辖区。国家为相对不发达地区提供特殊福利以吸引资本——例如，美国之前讨论过的“机会区”。国家还试图吸引对特殊经济区的投资，这表明并非所有法律对国家管辖区内的所有区域同等适用。考虑到离岸中心：它们的存在表明“一个主权国家为外国投资者提供了在其领土上在与本国公民适用的法律条件不同的法律条件下进行经济活动的能力”，这种提议“在国家领土上放弃法律的普遍性”（格斯滕贝格，2009：684）。而且，“从国家理论的角度来看，这使得特定国家的法律平等适用于其领土的原则成了一种虚构。这对劳动斗争的前景有副作用”（同上：684）。事实上，通常保护工会权利的法律并不适用于这些离岸中心或特别企业区，这些区域“极大地加速了业务的国际放松动态”。 资本主义以不平衡和结合发展而闻名（在第11章讨论）。不平衡发展经常导致所谓的内部殖民主义的出现：地区和人民（工资工人和小规模生产者）被政治上阻止以市场价格出售他们的劳动力和其他商品，因而受到高于平均水平的剥削。这发生在控制国家权力的特定资本主义阶级部分的利益中，常常以其种族等为理由。 2 官僚国家形式和国家的政治统治 当列宁（1919a）谈到一个在“相对狭窄的范围内、行动范围有限”的“技术上薄弱的国家机构”时，他似乎暗示了迈克尔·曼（Michael Mann，2012：13）所称的基础设施权力，这与专制权力相区别： 专制权力是国家精英在未与主要的民间社会团体代表协商的情况下做出任意决定的能力。基础设施权力是一个国家（无论是专制还是民主）真正渗透社会并在整个领域实施物流政治决策的能力。“基础设施权力”使国家能够通过或渗透他们的社会（“通过的权力”），而“专制权力”的行使则是由一个在一定程度上对社会拥有权威性“控制权”的国家实施的。 这意味着“国家可能以两种截然不同的方式‘强大’”。也就是说，“国家可以对其公民下达任何命令（专制权力）或者它们实际上可以在其领土上实施决策（基础设施权力）”（曼，2012：13）。"},{"prompt":"请将“To say that the state exercises despotic and infrastructural power is to raise the issue of the agency that exercises these powers on behalf of the state. It is the (civilian and military) bureaucracy that exercises both forms of state power. As we have seen earlier, as a structure of relations, the state itself has a degree of autonomy, and state officials and politicians as bearers of that structure have their own autonomy. This autonomy exists within limits that are set by the fact that the state must look after the common interests of the exploiting class (and of society at large). Of course, the actual degree of autonomy enjoyed varies from one state to another. Indeed, it can also vary within the territorial jurisdiction of a nation-state across policy areas because of state’s own organizational features.9 It can also vary across regions within a country. Bureaucratism is the trait of the state’s bureaucratic form. It has several aspects, including red tapism that the bourgeoisie hates if it is a barrier to its freedom to make money.10 Here I wish to emphasize bureaucratism as bureaucratic oppres-sion of the masses, which compounds class-based oppression and exploitation. Bureaucratism — extreme form of the exercise of power of unelected officials (as well as the politicians with executive functions) over the masses — exists for various reasons. Poverty and politics of workers and small-scale producers Given the poverty and lack of (functional) education of workers and smallscale producers, there is a lack of adequate participation on their part.11 ‘Under capitalism, democracy is restricted, cramped, curtailed, mutilated by all the conditions of wage slavery, and the poverty and misery of the people’ (Lenin, 1949). This causes bureaucratism within the state (and not just within the state). Poverty of the masses is a part of a larger issue — inequality and scarcity of necessaries. The latter create a condition for bureaucratism which, in turn, stifles participation of the masses: The basis of bureaucratic rule is the poverty of society in objects of con-sumption, with the resulting struggle of each against all. When there is enough goods in a store, the purchasers can come whenever they want to. When there is little goods, the purchasers are compelled to stand in line. When the lines are very long, it is necessary to appoint a policeman [or some such state regulator] to keep order. (Trotsky, 1991: 96) While, in ordinary times, large segments of the exploited class fail to actively participate in the affairs of the state thus contributing to bureaucratism within the state, that does not mean that the working class is never politically active. Advanced sections of the working class do remain politically engaged (pulling other sections behind them). This contributes to the emergence of workingclass parties. As these parties enter the parliament, indicating a widening of the basis for class politics, and as there is increasing concentration and centralization of capital showing a narrower basis for capitalist accumulation, this contradiction between working class politics and capitalist concentration/centralization is resolved in a particular way. That is, the task of ensuring political dominance of the bourgeois class increasingly gets transferred from the parliament to successively higher levels of bureaucracy (Mandel, 1978: 482). This promotes bureaucratism within the state. No matter what, there is always a possibility of class struggle of the masses. If the state is accessible to everyone or to the majority, it cannot perform its function in support of a tiny minority class, the class of exploiters. Bureaucratism is a political technique of keeping the masses under control. Such control is facilitated by the fact that the bureaucrats are very different from the masses and have an enormous amount of power. This is especially so in the LDCs which have massive economic and educational inequalities. The bureaucratic state form does rely on lower classes: it ‘provides the upper sections of the peasants, small artisans, tradesmen, and the like with comparatively comfortable, quiet, and respectable jobs raising the holders above the people’ (Lenin, 1949: 31). But the top officials share, or come from, bourgeois (or large-scale landowner) social-economic background, or share bourgeois ideas/ideals. They often share membership in, or quietly sympathize with, one of the main bourgeois governing parties. Their formal wages, which are many times that an average wage of a (state) worker, are handsomely supplemented by various perks (free housing, servants, cars, and so on). Many get lucrative jobs in business after formal retirement, and that could not be happening without a prior history of pro-business credentials and loyalty. Their social being — high salaries and extremely comfortable living, intermingling and handshaking with capitalists and their allies/hangers-on, is such that they fail to share the worldview of the common people, including those who occupy lower positions within the state. In the US, where the cabinet consists of carefully selected officers and/or politicians, they normally have prior business connections or have credentials as pro-business politicians/officers. This is most recently demonstrated by the Biden Cabinet which is sold as being progressive because it includes women and racialized minorities.12 There is not only a massive difference in income and living standards between high-level state actors (officials and politicians) who live like kings and queens, and the men and women who are wage earners or small-scale producers. There are also enormous differences within the state structure: for example, economic and social differences among state employees. Given this, top level state actors have the same standard of living, as the big bourgeoisie, so that they are part of the same social and ideological climate. Then come the middle functionaries, the middle officials, who are on the same social level and have the same income as the petty and middle bourgeoisie. And finally, the mass of employees without titles, charwomen, community workers, who very often earn less than factory workers. Their standard of living clearly corresponds to that of the proletariat. (Mandel, 1969) Thus, ‘[t]he state apparatus is not a homogeneous instrument. It involves a structure that rather closely corresponds to the structure of bourgeois society, with a hierarchy of classes and identical differences between them’ (Mandel, 1969).13 Officials, who are ‘divorced from the people and standing above the people’, have a ‘privileged position . . . as organs of state power’ (Lenin, 1949: 15). ‘Having public power and the right to levy taxes,’ Engels writes, ‘the officials now stand, as organs of society, above society. The free, voluntary respect that was accorded to the organs of the gentile [clan] constitution does not satisfy them, even if they could gain it. . . .’ Special laws are enacted proclaiming the sanctity and immunity of the officials. (Lenin, 1949: 15) That is how ‘“[t]he shabbiest police servant” has more “authority” than the representative of the clan’ (Engels in Lenin, 1949: 15). It should also be noted that class struggle is partially ‘present’ within the state. A large part of the state is occupied by men and women who belong to working class and peasant background. Majority of state workers (here I am excluding those in the police and the army) are like the proletarians in the private sector: they have little control over their working life, and their wages are barely enough for their survival. Given the consequent class contradictions within state (top-level officers being in favour of the capitalist class versus lower-level officers who may sympathize with workers), there is a need for strict control over the latter. Bureaucratism serves this function. Need for bureaucratic expertise Managing the common affairs of the capitalist class and therefore of the state requires expertise. It is a different kind of work than the work of con- trolling/managing a capitalist company or indeed a political party. The state is partly ‘an intellectual enterprise which draws upon the . . . skills of state officials to formulate policy goals and to administer, implement, and enforce those goals’ (Barrow, 1993: 131—2). Enormous extension of state activities means that the politicians who come and go cannot understand the full significance of new interventions, so this work is done by permanent administration (Mandel, 1978: 490). Top state actors as part of permanent administration are therefore carefully chosen. In many countries, they are selected on the basis of competitive examinations. The more difficult it is to secure a top bureaucrat job (as in India or Japan), the more prestigious is the job — and the position — considered to be. The ways in which state actors are recruited — and this is an important part of state’s bureaucratic form — shape how it performs its functions in relation to the two basic classes. State officials need to have a high level of education, and this means that common people are excluded from entering the decision-making layers of the state. Mandel (1969) writes: You have to have certain degrees, you have to have taken certain courses, to apply for certain positions, especially important positions. Such a system excludes a huge number of people who were not able to get a university education or its equivalent, because equality of educational opportunity doesn’t really exist. Even if the civil service examination system is democratic on the surface, it is also a selective instrument. Such a structure causes bureaucratism which is a source of oppression of the masses, who rely on the varying levels of financial support from the state, which is actually delivered by state actors. Such oppression is partly independent of the exploitation/oppression to which capitalism subjects the masses to. Bureaucratism is indeed a massive and sharp tool to keep the masses under control. It is rooted in class relations (even if it cannot be reduced to those relations). Autonomous power of state actors is a result of the autonomy of state power, and state’s power is fundamentally rooted in the fact that it is a class institution, that is, that it must subjugate the workers and small-scale producers in order to defend the fundamental interests of the exploiting class. This idea can be expressed as follows: Class power ^ state power ^ state actors’power over the masses — bureaucratism. 3 Summary, and theoretical and political implications This chapter is focused on state form. It begins with the geographical form of the state, including the scale division of labour within the state between more local and more central branches of the state. It then turns to the bureaucratic form (the question of bureaucratism and how the latter is a form of domination over common people). As we have seen in Chapter 7, at a concrete level, capitalism does impose constraints on the state. And this constraint can be reinforced due to the geo-graphical form of the state. Just as capital exists in the forms of many capitals in a given region/country, so global capitalism exists in the form of many political jurisdictions across and within countries: this means that not only are there many nation-states, but also are there many ‘national working classes’ into which the nation-state system of global capitalism splits the global working class (even if in reality, the working class has no nation). ‘In each national jurisdiction, the employment and welfare of the labor force depends on the profitability of each labor force in competition with all other labor forces on a world-market scale’, the profitability that the state must ensure which is why: ‘the political state is invariably a “planner” for the global competitiveness of “its” national labor force’ (Bonefeld, 2021: 182). A similar process is at play at sub-national scales too. The state is increasingly caught between the need to serve capitalist accu-mulation and the need to meet the needs of the masses. The state, of course, will attend to the former. This tends to create ‘national state forms that are “fortress states” prone to using repressive measures to protect capital accumulation against democratic popular demands for protective regulations and social welfare provision’ (Barrow, 2021: 174). And when a strong socialist movement is absent, ‘fascism and dictatorship are now ever-present tendencies of the capitalist state, rather than exceptional circumstances, as once thought’ (ibid.).”翻译为中文","completion":"说国家行使专制和基础设施权力，就是提出了代表国家行使这些权力的代理机构的问题。这是（文职和军事）官僚机构行使这两种形式的国家权力。如我们之前所见，作为一种关系结构，国家本身具有一定的自治性，而作为该结构载体的国家官员和政治人物也拥有他们自己的自主权。这种自主性存在于由这样一个事实设定的限制之内：国家必须照顾剥削阶级的共同利益（以及整个社会的利益）。当然，实际享有的自主程度因国家而异。实际上，由于国家自身的组织特性，它还可能在一个国家的领土管辖区内的政策领域内有所不同。它也可能在一个国家内的不同地区有所不同。 官僚主义是国家官僚形式的特征。官僚主义包括几个方面，包括资产阶级所厌恶的，如果它成为其赚钱自由的障碍的官僚作风。在这里，我希望强调官僚主义作为对大众的官僚压迫，这加剧了基于阶级的压迫和剥削。官僚主义——未经选举的官员（以及具有执行职能的政治人物）对大众行使权力的极端形式——存在于各种原因。 鉴于工人和小规模生产者的贫困和缺乏（功能性）教育，他们缺乏足够的参与。“在资本主义下，民主是被薪资奴役的所有条件所限制、压缩、削减、毁坏的，以及人民的贫困和苦难”（列宁，1949）。这在国家内部（不仅仅是在国家内）引起了官僚主义。 大众的贫困是更大问题的一部分——不平等和必需品的匮乏。后者为官僚主义创造了条件，反过来又扼杀了大众的参与： 官僚统治的基础是社会在消费品方面的贫乏，导致了人人自危的斗争。当商店里的商品充足时，购买者可以随时来购买。当商品少时，购买者被迫排队。当队伍很长时，就需要指派一名警察（或某种国家监管者）来维持秩序。 （托洛斯基，1991：96） 虽然在平常时期，被剥削阶级的大部分群体未能积极参与国家事务，从而促成了国家内部的官僚主义，但这并不意味着工人阶级从未政治活跃。工人阶级的先进部分仍然保持政治参与（带动其他部分）。这有助于工人阶级政党的出现。随着这些党派进入议会，表明阶级政治基础的扩大，随着资本集中和集权的增加显示出资本积累基础的缩小，工人阶级政治与资本集中/集权之间的矛盾以特定方式得到解决。也就是说，确保资产阶级政治统治的任务越来越多地从议会转移到越来越高层次的官僚机构（曼德尔，1978：482）。这促进了国家内部的官僚主义。 无论如何，总是有大众的阶级斗争的可能性。如果国家对所有人或大多数人都开放，它就不能执行支持极少数剥削阶级的功能。官僚主义是一种控制大众的政治技术。这种控制得以实施，是因为官僚和大众有很大的不同，并且拥有巨大的权力。在拥有巨大的经济和教育不平等的低收入国家中尤其如此。 官僚国家形态确实依赖于下层阶级：它“为农民上层、小工匠、小商人等提供了相对舒适、安静、体面的工作，使其地位高于普通人”（列宁，1949：31）。但顶级官员分享或来自于资产阶级（或大地主）的社会经济背景，或分享资产阶级的想法/理想。他们通常是主要的资产阶级执政党的成员，或对其保持默许的同情。他们的正式工资，是平均工资（国家工人）的多倍，通过各种额外待遇（免费住房、仆人、汽车等）得到了丰厚的补充。许多人在正式退休后得到了有利可图的商业工作，如果没有事先的亲商证明和忠诚，这是不可能发生的。他们的社会存在——高薪酬和极为舒适的生活、与资本家及其盟友/追随者的交往和握手，使得他们无法分享普通人，包括那些在国家内部占据较低位置的人的世界观。在美国，内阁由精心挑选的官员和/或政治人物组成，他们通常有先前的商业联系或作为亲商政治人物/官员的资历。这最近由拜登内阁展示，因为它包括妇女和有色人种少数群体而被宣传为进步。 在高级国家行动者（官员和政治人物）生活得像国王和王后一样，而工资收入者或小规模生产者之间不仅存在着巨大的收入和生活标准差异。国家结构内部也存在着巨大差异：例如，国家雇员之间的经济和社会差异。鉴于此，顶级国家行动者 拥有与大资产阶级相同的生活标准，因此他们是同一社会和意识形态氛围的一部分。然后是中层公务员，中级官员，他们处于与小资产阶级和中资产阶级相同的社会层次和收入水平。最后是没有头衔的大量雇员，清洁工，社区工作者，他们的工资很多时候甚至低于工厂工人。他们的生活标准显然对应于无产阶级。 （曼德尔，1969） 因此，“国家机器不是一个同质的工具。它涉及一个与资产阶级社会的结构相当一致的结构，有阶级的层级和它们之间的相同差异”（曼德尔，1969）。官员们“与人民脱节，凌驾于人民之上”，他们“作为国家权力机关享有特权地位”（列宁，1949：15）。 恩格斯写道，“拥有公共权力和征税权的官员现在，作为社会的器官，凌驾于社会之上。对氏族[宗族]制度器官的自由、自愿的尊重不能满足他们，即使他们能得到它……”特别法律被制定，宣布官员的神圣和豁免权。 （列宁，1949：15） 这就是为什么“‘最卑鄙的警察仆从’比氏族的代表拥有更多的‘权威’”（恩格斯在列宁，1949：15中提到）。 还应该注意到，阶级斗争在部分上在国家内部“存在”。国家的很大一部分由属于工人阶级和农民背景的男女占据。国家工人的大多数（在这里我排除了警察和军队中的工人）就像私营部门的无产者一样：他们对自己的工作生活几乎没有控制，他们的工资勉强够他们生存。鉴于国家内部的阶级矛盾（顶级官员支持资产阶级而低级官员可能与工人同情），对后者需要严格控制。官僚主义发挥了这一功能。 需要官僚专业知识 管理资产阶级的共同事务，因此管理国家，需要专业知识。这是一种与控制/管理资本主义公司或实际上一个政党的工作不同的工作。国家在部分上是“一个智力企业，依靠国家官员的……技能来制定政策目标并管理、实施和执行这些目标”（巴罗，1993：131-132）。国家活动的巨大扩展意味着，来来去去的政治人物无法理解新干预的全部意义，所以这项工作由永久性行政部门完成（曼德尔，1978：490）。因此，顶级国家行动者作为永久性行政部门的一部分被谨慎挑选。在许多国家，他们是基于竞争性考试的基础上被选中的。获得顶级官僚工作越困难（如在印度或日本），这项工作和职位就被认为越有声望。国家行动者的招募方式——这是国家官僚形态的一个重要部分——塑造了其相对于两个基本阶级执行其职能的方式。国家官员需要有高等教育水平，这意味着普通人被排除在国家决策层之外。曼德尔（1969）写道： 你必须拥有某些学位，你必须修过某些课程，才能申请某些职位，尤其是重要职位。这样的系统排除了大量无法获得大学教育或其等同教育的人，因为教育机会的平等实际上并不存在。即使公务员考试制度表面上是民主的，它也是一个选择性的工具。 这样的结构导致了官僚主义，这是对依赖国家不同财政支持层次的大众的压迫的来源，实际上是由国家行动者提供的。这种压迫在部分上独立于资本主义将大众置于剥削/压迫之下。官僚主义确实是一种强大而尖锐的工具，用以控制大众。它植根于阶级关系（即使它不能被简化为那些关系）。国家行动者的自治权是国家权力自治性的结果，而国家的权力根本上源于它是一个阶级机构的事实，也就是说，它必须使工人和小规模生产者臣服，以保卫剥削阶级的根本利益。这个想法可以如下表达： 阶级权力 ^ 国家权力 ^ 国家行动者对大众的权力 — 官僚主义。 总结，以及理论和政治含义 本章聚焦于国家形式。它从国家的地理形式开始，包括国家内部更地方和更中央分支之间的劳动分工规模。然后转向官僚形式（官僚主义问题以及后者如何成为对普通人的一种统治形式）。 正如我们在第7章中看到的，在具体层面上，资本主义确实对国家施加了限制。而这种限制可以由于国家的地理形式而得到加强。正如资本以一个给定地区/国家的许多资本的形式存在，全球资本主义也以许多个国家的政治管辖区的形式横跨和存在于国家内部：这意味着不仅有许多民族国家，还有许多“国家工人阶级”，全球资本主义的民族国家体系将全球工人阶级分割开来（即使实际上，工人阶级没有国家）。\\"在每个国家管辖区，劳动力的就业和福利都取决于与世界市场规模上所有其他劳动力的竞争中每个劳动力的盈利能力，这是国家必须确保的盈利能力，这就是为什么：“政治国家总是作为“其”国家劳动力在全球竞争中的‘规划者’”（博内费尔德，2021：182）。在次国家规模上也存在类似的过程。 国家越来越多地陷入服务于资本积累的需要和满足大众需求的需要之间的困境。国家当然会优先考虑前者。这往往创造出“要塞国家”形式的民族国家，倾向于使用压制性措施来保护资本积累免受民主化的普遍需求对保护性规定和社会福利提供的要求（巴罗，2021：174）。当强大的社会主义运动缺席时，“法西斯主义和独裁现在是资本主义国家的常在倾向，而不是如曾经认为的那样是特殊情况”（同上）。"},{"prompt":"请将“The geographical form of the state has several political implications for the masses. In bourgeois democracy, an electoral constituency is multi-class: there are workers and various kinds of property owners all combined into a constituency, and there are no class-based constituencies.14 This fact is a barrier to workers and small-scale producers expressing their political choice and electing their own leaders. The state — or the ruling party — can resort to gerrymandering in order to blunt any potential class or ‘class-like’ polarization in terms of the division between politically progressive voters and politically conservative voters.15 The bicameral system can check popular sovereignty.16 In addition, territoriality of the state allows capital to weaken the working class and pro-worker interventions: capital plays state institutions of one city or province/region against those of another to extract concessions. Thus, state’s territorial form becomes a terrain for the operation of the competitive logic of capital. Given the differences in working-class strength across cities and regions within a country, capital plays workers from one jurisdiction against those from others by threatening to move and/or by actually moving. Besides, the scalar division of labour allows the state itself to resort to spatial fix — or a scalar fix: to explain away its failure to meet the needs of the people (e.g. failure to deal with the pandemic or alleviate poverty), the central state blames it on regional/ provincial state institutions, and the latter on the former. As a result, the territoriality of the state form helps the state to hide the main cause of its failure which is, more or less, the fact that it must serve the needs of capitalists at the expense of those of the masses. What is ultimately a class relation mediated by the state becomes a matter of the relation between state institutions at different geographical scales. While the state does many things, including for the common people, the way in which it does things is generally bureaucratic. Direct participation of the people in the affairs of the state does not usually happen. This is not an accident. If everyone is involved in the running of the state, as Lenin says, the state cannot serve the interests of a tiny minority. So the bureaucratic form of the state17 and the fact that state is fundamentally undemocratic while appearing to be democratic are connected. Marx (1871a: 23) indeed described the French state of his time in his Civil War in France as ‘the centralized state power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, and judicature — organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labor’, a power that suffocates the social-cultural life of common people. The state does many things for society as a whole and for the masses. It builds schools, universities, and hospitals. It constructs roads, railways, and electricity-generating plants. It builds the internet infrastructure. Marx, in fact, mocked those — the indifferentists — who thought that fighting for such things as state-funded education was too reformist an act. Marx said the following impersonating the indifferentists: Workers should even less desire that, as happens in the United States of America, the state whose budget is swollen by what is taken from the working class should be obliged to give primary education to the workers’ children; for primary education is not complete education. It is better that working men and working women should not be able to read or write or do sums than that they should receive education from a teacher in a school run by the state. (Marx, 1873) Yet there is a catch. There is something concealed behind such state functions and indeed behind any theoretical claim that show euphoric enthusiasm for such functions. We need to think about state form which reacts back on state function. David McNally (2019) says that according to Marx the state severs state’s functioning, including pro-people actions, ‘from the common interests of the people — *alienating* them from the people by ensconcing them in the hands of the state bureaucracy’. As a result, as Marx says, Every common interest was straightaway severed from society, counterposed to it as a higher, general interest, snatched from the activity of society’s members themselves and made an object of government activity, from a bridge, a schoolhouse and the communal property of the village community to the railways, the national wealth and the national university of France. (in McNally, 2019) That does not mean, of course, that ‘Marx wants to “smash” railways and schools, provided by the state. But it does follow that dismantling the bureaucratic-military state involves *transforming* all state institutions into genuinely public ones’ (ibid.). This involves the question about state form, once again. The state form — the form of the content of state—society relation — is designed to exclude direct participation of the masses in their common affairs. Many pro-poor policies (e.g. policies that aim to distribute land to the peasantry, or provide employment to the workers) often fail because state funds and state functioning are captured by state actors and by affluent property owners, and consequently, the masses have no role in the implementation of these policies. The general point is that no matter how democratic the state is, no matter how many opportunities it provides for struggles by the masses, its form problematizes its function in the interests of the masses. That is partly why ‘the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes’ (Marx, 1871a: 23). 11 Capitalism, imperialism, and the state in the global periphery Marx (1887: 207) says in Capital 1: ‘The nature of capital remains the same in its developed as it is in its undeveloped forms.’ This means that at a fundamental level and at an international scale, class relations of advanced capitalism and those of the capitalist periphery (LDCs) must be similar. Partly because of this, the analysis of the state in the abstract and in the context of the advanced capitalist countries (as conducted in Chapters 4—10), more or less, applies to the state in the periphery. Yet periphery’s class relations and economic development have certain specificities because of which the peripheral capitalist state cannot be exactly like the state under advanced capitalism.1 According to Marx’s Capital 1, capitalism develops in historical stages. The first is the formal subsumption of labour (FSL), where labour is exploited on the basis of the appropriation of absolute surplus value, and capitalism is characterized by a relatively low level of the development of productive forces. The second is the real subsumption of labour (RSL), where capitalists resort to a systemic use of labour-productivity-enhancing technical change causing the appropriation of relative surplus value from labour. What if the periphery is characterized by a different kind of capitalism (relative dominance of the FSL) than the one that exists in the advanced countries, and what implication might this have for the state? And what implication for the state might there be of the following facts: the periphery has a recent colonial past and continues to be impacted by imperialism; it experiences a (relative) under-development of productive forces and a low level of labour productivity; a large majority there do not earn enough to ensure a normal level of bodily reproduction; a large number of people still depend on land-based productive activities some of which are carried on within social relations that are not quite capitalist; and a high proportion of the workforce are small-scale producers in rural and urban areas.2 Similarly, what implications are there for the state of the fact that the countries in periphery generally do not have the ability to produce the means of production (e.g. tools, machines, and the like) needed to produce the means of consumption and are more dependent on the economies of advanced countries than the latter are on them?3 In this chapter, I explore the specificity of the periphery’s class structure and draw its implications for the objective pressure on ‘the peripheral state’ (see Figures 6.1, 7.1, and 7.2). The chapter begins, in Section 1, with a discussion on the extent to which production structure in the periphery is ‘auto-centric’. Section 2 examines the specific character of capitalism in the periphery. Section 3 discusses imperialism from the standpoint of the periphery and its state. Sections 4—7 respectively discuss the class-alliance that holds state power, the state in relation to the struggle of the lower classes (proletarians, semi-proletarians, and small-scale producers), and failure of the state to meet their needs, the coercive nature of the peripheral state, and the potential threat to state’s legitimacy. The final section concludes the chapter (and the book). 1 Disarticulated development of productive forces in the periphery In an economy, one sector produces means of consumption, and another sector produces means of production. The latter sector has two sub-sectors: one produces means of production needed to produce consumption goods, and another produces other means of production.4 ‘In order to be auto-centered an economy must contain production at all of these levels and especially at the two highest levels of reproductive importance’ which involve the production of the means of production (Ougaard, 1982: 389). In addition, the different sectors and subsectors must be articulated with one another, even if an auto-centred economy does not have to produce all the products in all the three major sectors (ibid.). In the core, accumulation is autocentric: ‘production of capital goods and the production of consumption goods’ are articulated with one another, and foreign relations of central economies ‘are subject to the requirements of this determinate articulation’, and therefore generally ‘labor’s pay can follow the progress of productivity’5 (Amin, 2009: 272). In contrast, the peripheral economy tends to be dominated more by the production of consumption goods and less by other types of production. A significant level of production in all the sectors/sub-sectors mentioned earlier is absent in a typical peripheral economy. An industrializing peripheral economy often assembles imported industrial parts, as it happens in many SEZs and Mexican maquiladoras. Or, some countries produce IT support, including in call-centres, for advanced countries. A major part of the periphery’s IT industry is actually similar to its manufacturing assembly, where low-paid engineers such as those in India ‘develop components or subpackages/assemblies/programmes that go into the final products made and marketed by US companies’ (Bidwai, 2003). Bidwai says that ‘a good proportion of the sub-programmes in Windows 95 and 98 were developed by Indian engineers. But it’s Mr Bill Gates who skimmed off the profits!’ (ibid.) ”翻译为中文","completion":"国家的地理形态对大众有几个政治含义。在资产阶级民主中，选举选区是多阶级的：有工人和各种类型的财产所有者都组成了一个选区，没有基于阶级的选区。这一事实是工人和小规模生产者表达他们的政治选择和选举自己的领导人的障碍。国家——或执政党——可以诉诸于选区划分操纵，以淡化任何潜在的阶级或“类似阶级”的两极分化，就政治上进步的选民与政治上保守的选民之间的分裂而言。两院制可以检查民众主权。此外，国家的领土性允许资本削弱工人阶级和亲工人的干预：资本利用一个城市或省份/地区的国家机构对抗另一个地区的机构来争取让步。因此，国家的领土形式成为资本竞争逻辑运作的领域。鉴于一个国家内城市和地区之间工人阶级力量的差异，资本通过威胁搬迁和/或实际搬迁，将一个管辖区的工人与另一管辖区的工人对立起来。此外，劳动力的规模分工使国家本身能够诉诸于空间修正——或规模修正：为了解释其未能满足人民需求的失败（例如，未能应对疫情或减轻贫困），中央国家将其归咎于地区/省级国家机构，后者则归咎于前者。因此，国家形态的领土性帮助国家隐藏其失败的主要原因，或多或少，即它必须以牺牲大众的利益为代价，来服务于资本家的需求。最终是通过国家中介的阶级关系变成了不同地理规模上的国家机构之间的关系问题。 尽管国家做了很多事情，包括为普通民众，但它做事的方式通常是官僚化的。人们直接参与国家事务通常不会发生。这不是偶然的。如果每个人都参与国家的运行，正如列宁所说，国家就不能服务于极少数人的利益。因此，国家的官僚形式和国家在根本上是不民主的事实——尽管表面上看起来是民主的——是相连的。马克思（1871a：23）确实如此描述了他那个时代的法国国家，在他的《法兰西内战》中，称其为“中央集权的国家权力，拥有常备军、警察、官僚机构、神职人员和司法机构等无处不在的器官——这些器官是根据系统性和等级分工的计划制造的”，这种权力扼杀了普通民众的社会文化生活。 国家为整个社会和大众做了很多事情。它建造学校、大学和医院。它修建道路、铁路和发电厂。它建设互联网基础设施。实际上，马克思曾嘲笑那些——冷漠主义者——认为争取国家资助教育等事情太过改革派的行为的人。马克思假扮冷漠主义者说： 工人甚至不应该希望，像在美国那样，国家的预算因向工人阶级征税而膨胀，被迫为工人的孩子提供初等教育; 因为初等教育不是完整的教育。工人和妇女不会读写或做算术，倒不如他们接受国家学校老师的教育。 （马克思，1873） 然而，有一个问题。在这些国家职能背后，以及在任何对这些职能表现出狂热热情的理论声明背后，都有一些隐藏的东西。我们需要考虑国家形式，这反过来影响了国家职能。大卫·麦克纳利（2019）表示，根据马克思的观点，国家将国家的功能，包括亲民行动，“从人民的共同利益中割裂——通过将它们安置在国家官僚机构的手中，使它们与人民疏远”。结果，正如马克思所说， 每一个共同的利益都立即与社会割裂，与之对立为更高、更普遍的利益，从社会成员自己的活动中夺取，成为政府活动的对象，从桥梁、学校和村落公社的公共财产到法国的铁路、国家财富和国家大学。 （在麦克纳利，2019中引用） 当然，这并不意味着“马克思想要‘摧毁’国家提供的铁路和学校。但它确实意味着，拆除官僚-军事国家涉及*转变*所有国家机构为真正的公共机构”（同上）。这再次涉及到了国家形式的问题。 国家形式——国家-社会关系内容的形式——旨在排除大众直接参与其共同事务的可能性。许多亲民的政策（例如，旨在向农民分配土地或为工人提供就业的政策）往往失败，因为国家资金和国家职能被国家行动者和富有的财产所有者捕获，因此，大众在这些政策的实施中没有作用。总的来说，无论国家多么民主，无论它为大众的斗争提供多少机会，其形式都使其职能对大众利益构成问题。这部分是为什么“工人阶级不能简单地抓住现成的国家机器，并为其自己的目的使用它”（马克思，1871a：23）。 11 资本主义、帝国主义和全球边缘地带的国家 马克思（1887：207）在《资本论》第一卷中说：“资本的本质在其发展形式中和在其未发展形式中是相同的。”这意味着，在根本层面和国际规模上，发达资本主义和资本主义边缘地带（低收入国家）的阶级关系必须相似。部分由于这个原因，对国家的抽象分析和在发达资本主义国家背景下的分析（如第4-10章中进行的），或多或少，适用于边缘地带的国家。然而，由于边缘地带的阶级关系和经济发展有其特殊性，边缘地带的资本主义国家不能与发达资本主义下的国家完全相同。 据马克思在《资本论》第一卷中所述，资本主义按历史阶段发展。第一阶段是劳动力的形式归属（FSL），劳动力在绝对剩余价值的占有基础上被剥削，资本主义的特征是生产力发展水平相对较低。第二阶段是劳动力的实质归属（RSL），资本家诉诸于系统性地使用提高劳动生产率的技术变革，导致从劳动力中占有相对剩余价值。如果边缘地带的资本主义（相对于发达国家，FSL占主导地位）有不同的特征，这对国家有什么含义呢？ 以及以下事实对国家有何含义：边缘地带有近期的殖民历史并继续受到帝国主义的影响；它经历了（相对的）生产力发展不足和劳动生产率低下；那里的大多数人赚的不足以确保正常的身体再生产水平；许多人仍然依赖于土地生产活动，其中一些活动是在非完全资本主义的社会关系中进行的；而且大部分劳动力是农村和城市地区的小规模生产者。同样，边缘地带的国家普遍没有能力生产生产消费品所需的生产资料（如工具、机器等），并且比起后者更依赖于发达国家的经济吗？ 在本章中，我探讨边缘地带阶级结构的特殊性，并对“边缘地带国家”的客观压力进行了说明（见图6.1、7.1和7.2）。本章首先在第1节讨论边缘地带的生产结构在多大程度上是“自主中心的”。第2节考察边缘地带资本主义的特定性格。第3节从边缘地带及其国家的角度讨论帝国主义。第4-7节分别讨论掌握国家权力的阶级联盟、国家与下层阶级（无产者、半无产者和小规模生产者）的斗争的关系、国家未能满足他们需求的失败、边缘地带国家的强制性质，以及对国家合法性的潜在威胁。最后一节总结了本章（和本书）。"},{"prompt":"describe a Engineering company in Sweden","completion":"One engineering company in Sweden is Atlas Copco, a global industrial group that specializes in providing productivity solutions for a wide range of industries including mining, construction, and manufacturing.

They are one of humanity's oldest and most beloved pets, having been associated with humans for thousands of years. Cats are known for their agility, sharp retractable claws, and keen hunting instincts. They have a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and can make various vocalizations, including meowing, purring, hissing, and growling. Cats can live indoors or outdoors, but many owners choose to keep them indoors to protect them from the dangers of the outside world, like traffic and disease. Indoor cats often enjoy a longer lifespan due to this protected environment. Cats are independent creatures and can often entertain themselves, but they also seek affection and playtime from their human companions. They communicate through body language, vocalizations, and sometimes even by bringing \\"gifts\\" to their owners. A significant aspect of cat care includes providing them with regular veterinary checkups, vaccinations, a nutritious diet, and ensuring they are spayed or neutered to prevent overpopulation. Litter box training is also an essential part of cat ownership, with most cats naturally inclined to use a litter box for their waste. There are many breeds of cats, each with its own unique physical traits and personality. Some popular breeds include the Siamese, Persian, Maine Coon, and Bengal. Despite these differences, all domestic cats share a common ancestor in the Near Eastern wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica)."},{"prompt":"Gloopy is a teal blob of slime, who’s malleable nature allows him to shape-shift Glitter is a sparkling fuschia blob, and she is his best friend They are both aliens. Write a story where she decides to see how he is doing, and sees him listening to cool music, with headphones wrapped around his gelatinous body It had been a busy week for Gloopy. As a shape-shifting alien, he was constantly being called upon to help out with various tasks on their home planet. But despite the hectic schedule, he always found time to relax and unwind with his best friend, Glitter. One day, Glitter decided to check in on Gloopy to see how he was doing. She made her way to his living quarters and found him lying on his blob-like form, headphones wrapped around his gelatinous body. He had a contented smile on his face as he listened to the cool music playing through the headphones. “Hey Gloopy, what are you listening to?” Glitter asked, floating over to him. Gloopy opened his eyes and grinned at his friend. “Oh, just some tunes I picked up from a neighboring planet. It’s really relaxing and helps me decompress after a long day.” Glitter nodded in understanding. “That’s great, you deserve some rest after all the hard work you’ve been putting in. Mind if I join you?” Gloopy happily moved over, making space for Glitter to settle down next to him. They lay there in comfortable silence, listening to the music and enjoying each other’s company. As the music played on, Glitter couldn’t help but feel grateful for her friendship with Gloopy. He may be a teal blob of slime, but he was the most caring and supportive friend she could ask for. And with him by her side, she knew that no matter what challenges came their way, they would always have each other. With a smile on her face, Glitter snuggled closer to Gloopy, feeling the warmth of their bond enveloping them both. And in that moment, listening to the calming music, she knew that there was nowhere else she would rather be than right here with her best friend. Write a story where a green alien touches him, is amazed that his hand sinks into the gelatinous substance, and that he is amazed he is made of slime One day, as Gloopy was relaxing in his living quarters, a curious green alien approached him. Intrigued by Gloopy’s malleable nature, the alien reached out a hand and gently touched him. To his surprise, his hand sank into Gloopy’s gelatinous substance, feeling the cool and smooth texture beneath his fingers. The green alien’s eyes widened in amazement as he realized that Gloopy was made of slime. He had never encountered anything like it before and was fascinated by the unique abilities of the teal blob. Gloopy, for his part, chuckled at the alien’s reaction and morphed his form to engulf the alien’s hand in a gentle hug. “It’s all right, I’m used to it,” Gloopy said with a grin. “Being able to shape-shift has its perks, you know.” The green alien nodded, still in awe of Gloopy’s unusual composition. He couldn’t help but marvel at the way Gloopy could change his form at will, molding himself into different shapes and sizes. It was a talent that the alien had never imagined possible, and he found himself admiring Gloopy’s versatility and adaptability. As the green alien continued to interact with Gloopy, he realized that despite their differences, they both shared a sense of camaraderie and friendship. Gloopy’s unique nature may have been surprising at first, but it was ultimately what brought them together and strengthened their bond. And so, the green alien spent the rest of the day getting to know Gloopy better, learning about his abilities and enjoying the company of his new friend.

Write a story where A evil bounty hunter shoots him, resulting in teal slime splattered but the they start moving and reforming, It turns out he can reform from even the smallest drop, and with a tentacle like appendage, he reaches for a phone and calls the space police and has the hunter brought to justice Gloopy was enjoying a peaceful afternoon on his home planet when the tranquility was suddenly shattered by the appearance of a menacing figure - an evil bounty hunter looking to capture him. Before Gloopy could react, the hunter fired a powerful blast from his blaster, hitting Gloopy directly and causing teal slime to splatter all around. At first, it seemed like Gloopy had been defeated as his form dispersed into countless tiny droplets of slime. The bounty hunter sneered in triumph. But to his horror, the splattered teal slime began to move and reform, each droplet connecting to the others and slowly piecing Gloopy back together. The evil bounty hunter watched in shock as Gloopy’s slime started to reform and regenerate, his teal body reshaping and taking form once again. And to the hunter’s surprise, Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage, reaching for a nearby communication device. With determination in his gooey form, Gloopy managed to reach the phone and dial the emergency line for the space police. His voice, though gurgled and distorted, came through the receiver as he reported the actions of the evil bounty hunter and requested immediate assistance. The space police responded swiftly, arriving at the scene to find the hunter standing over Gloopy, who had fully reformed and was prepared to defend himself. The evil bounty hunter was no match for the combined forces of the space police and Gloopy, who used his shape-shifting abilities to outmaneuver and subdue the villain. In the end, justice was served as the evil bounty hunter was apprehended and taken into custody by the space police. Gloopy’s resilience and quick thinking had saved him from capture and allowed him to bring the criminal to justice. As the space police commended Gloopy for his bravery and resourcefulness, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride in his abilities. Despite his slimy nature, he had proven that he was a force to be reckoned with, able to overcome even the most dangerous of adversaries. And as he stood among his friends and allies, he knew that no one would ever underestimate the teal blob of slime again. Write that story from Glitter’s POV, she almost cried Glitter watched in horror as the evil bounty hunter took aim at Gloopy, her best friend. The blast hit Gloopy directly, causing his teal slime to splatter in all directions. Tears pricked at the corners of Glitter’s sparkling fuschia eyes as she saw Gloopy’s form disperse into countless droplets of slime on the ground. As the bounty hunter sneered in triumph, Glitter’s heart ached with fear. But then, something miraculous happened. The teal slime began to move and reform, each droplet connecting back together. Gloopy was piecing himself back together, defying all odds and showing off his incredible ability to regenerate. Glitter felt a surge of relief and awe as she watched Gloopy reform before her eyes. Her tears of fear turned into tears of pride as she saw her best friend stand tall once more, ready to take on the evil bounty hunter. She had always known Gloopy was special, but this display of resilience and determination left her speechless. When Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage and reached for the phone, calling the space police for help, Glitter’s admiration for him grew even stronger. She could see the bravery and strength within her friend, and she couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of love and gratitude for him. As the space police arrived and apprehended the bounty hunter, Glitter floated over to Gloopy, her sparkling form shimmering with relief. She hovered next to him, almost overwhelmed with emotion as she witnessed his victory over the villain. With a quivering voice, Glitter expressed her feelings to Gloopy, “I… I was so scared. I thought I lost you, my dear friend. But you… you are truly incredible, Gloopy. I almost cried when I saw you reforming from those tiny droplets. I am so grateful for you, and so proud to call you my best friend.” Gloopy turned to Glitter, a warm smile spreading across his teal slime. “Thank you, Glitter,” he said softly. “I couldn’t have done it without you by my side. Your support means everything to me.” And as they stood together, basking in the victory and their unbreakable bond, Glitter knew that she would always be there for Gloopy, no matter what challenges they faced. They were more than just friends – they were partners in crime, united in strength and love. And with tears glistening in her eyes, Glitter knew that Gloopy would forever hold a special place in her sparkling heart. Write a story where Glitter talks to a tentacled creature while Gloopy is in the bathroom While Gloopy was busy in the bathroom taking care of his slimey business, Glitter decided to explore their surroundings on their home planet. She floated through the corridors until she came across a room filled with strange and fascinating creatures. One in particular caught her attention - a tentacled creature with shimmering scales and curious eyes. Glitter approached the tentacled creature, her sparkling fuschia form radiating with curiosity. The creature turned to her, its tentacles gently waving in the air as it observed the glittering alien before it. With a gentle smile, Glitter started a conversation with the creature, fascinated by its unique appearance and mysterious aura. “Hello there, I’m Glitter. What’s your name?” she asked, her voice gentle and welcoming. The tentacled creature regarded her with a blend of curiosity and warmth. It responded in a melodic and unfamiliar language, its tentacles moving in intricate patterns that seemed to convey meaning. Glitter couldn’t understand the words, but she could sense the creature’s friendly nature and willingness to communicate. As they continued to interact, Glitter and the tentacled creature found ways to communicate through gestures, expressions, and the universal language of friendship. They shared stories about their respective worlds, exchanged knowledge about their cultures, and bonded over their shared love for exploration and discovery. In the midst of their conversation, Gloopy emerged from the bathroom, his teal slime glistening under the light. He was surprised to see Glitter engaged in conversation with the tentacled creature, but he couldn’t help but smile at the sight. It warmed his gelatinous heart to see his best friend forming connections with other beings, even in his absence. Approaching them, Gloopy joined the conversation, introducing himself to the tentacled creature and exchanging greetings. The creature responded in kind, its tentacles forming complex patterns that seemed to convey joy and acceptance. As they continued to talk and share stories, Glitter, Gloopy, and the tentacled creature discovered a newfound kinship that transcended language and appearance. They laughed, learned, and bonded over their shared moments of connection, grateful for the opportunity to forge friendships across different worlds. And as they floated together, bathed in the glow of friendship and understanding, Glitter couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for the beautiful encounters that life had to offer. In that moment, amidst laughter and camaraderie, she knew that the universe was full of wonders waiting to be explored and cherished. Write a story where a human traveler wonders how creatures like them can even exist while pointing at them, confused by their amorphous, slime body The human traveler had journeyed far across the cosmos, seen many wonders, and encountered various forms of life. But nothing prepared him for the sight of Gloopy and Glitter. As he strolled through the intergalactic bazaar, a hive of chatter and exotic items from a thousand worlds, his eyes fell upon the pair: one a teal blob with headphones slack around its body, and the other a sparkling fuschia entity, hovering nearby. “Excuse me,” the traveler said, trying to mask his astonishment as he approached them. “How do creatures like you even exist?” He pointed at them, his finger moving from one to the other, clearly baffled by their amorphous, slime forms. Gloopy, who had just removed his headphones, turned his gelatinous face toward the traveler and reshaped his ‘body’ to form what resembled a head with an amiable expression. “You know, we get that a lot,” Gloopy replied in a casual tone, his voice emanating from within his slime form. “We’re just different expressions of life. It’s like how on your planet, you have humans, octopuses, and things that are even stranger.” Glitter shimmered intensely for a moment, as if laughing. “Yeah, and just because we don’t have bones or skin like you do, doesn’t make us any less real.” The traveler knelt down, inspecting Gloopy more closely. “Forgive me, it’s not every day you see a sentient blob of slime… I mean—” “No offense taken,” Gloopy interjected with a morphing smile. “We understand our appearance can be quite, well, alien.” The human nodded slowly, his curiosity piqued. “Do you have organs like us? Bones or…anything?” he asked, his gaze drifting from Gloopy to Glitter and back again. Glitter giggled, a sparkling sound that echoed like tiny bells. “Nope! We’re one hundred percent slime based. We have specialized cells that can do all the necessary functions: take in nutrients, expel waste, you name it.” “And we can morph and stretch, which comes in handy,” Gloopy added, demonstrating by extending an arm-like appendage to twice its original length. “So, you’re basically immortal then? You can’t be hurt?” the traveler mused aloud. “Not exactly,” Gloopy responded, his texture turning a bit more serious. “We can get hurt, but as you may have noticed, we can recover from many injuries by re-forming our bodies.” The traveler stood up, a newfound respect etched upon his face. “Incredible. I’ve studied exobiology, but you two defy all conventional understanding. You’re living proof that life is diverse and endlessly surprising.” Gloopy and Glitter exchanged a look, a silent communication passing between them. “You know,” Glitter said, “Maybe we can teach you a thing or two about life beyond what is known on Earth.” The traveler’s eyes sparkled with the promise of knowledge yet undiscovered. “I’d like that very much,” he said, his perspective on life broader than ever before. “It would be an honor to learn from you both.” As the suns set on the horizon, casting an array of colorful hues across the sky, the trio settled down for what would be the first of many discussions about the vast complexities and beauties of the universe. Together, they explored the profound mysteries of life, becoming ambassadors of their respective worlds, and friends who would share wonders beyond imagination. Write a story where they ask the scientist if there are anyone like them on other planet Gloopy and Glitter had always been curious about the vast expanse of the cosmos and whether there were other beings like them scattered across different worlds. Their inquisitive natures led them to seek out the wisdom of a renowned interstellar scientist, Dr. Lysara, who specialized in xenobiology and the study of extraterrestrial life forms. They found Dr. Lysara in her laboratory, tucked away on a space station that orbited a vibrant nebula, a place teeming with scientific discovery and intergalactic study. The laboratory was filled with holographic projections of different planets and life forms, and the air hummed with data streams from her field explorations. “Dr. Lysara,” Glitter began, her sparkling form catching the ambient light, “we have traveled across the stars to ask you a question that burns within us.” Dr. Lysara, a human-like being with skin the color of twilight and eyes that shone like binary stars, turned to the pair with interest. “And what question is that, my iridescent friends?” Gloopy reshaped his form into something resembling a chair and settled himself comfortably. “We wonder,” he said, “are there others like us out there? Beings made of slime or similar substances? Have your explorations revealed creatures who are malleable, like me, or sparkling, like Glitter?” The scientist’s eyes gleamed with a mixture of excitement and thoughtfulness as she listened to their query. She walked over to her terminal, her fingers gliding across a control panel that activated a three-dimensional galactic map. “Your question is both profound and intriguing,” Dr. Lysara replied, her voice echoing softly in the high-ceilinged room. “The universe is vast and filled with wonders, and my research has indeed uncovered a plethora of life forms with unique compositions.” She tapped on the holographic interface, and images of various planets and organisms began to float in the air around them. “Here,” she pointed to a translucent, floating entity, “is the Paramist of Nebulon IV, creatures of gas and softly glowing membranes that drift through their planet’s upper atmosphere.” Another tap brought forth a new image, this one of a thick, viscous creature that seemed to be nothing but a rolling mass of liquid. “And this,” she continued, “is a Sylopod from the oceanic world of Aquarion Prime. Much like you, Gloopy, they possess the ability to change shape and consist of a gelatinous substance.” Glitter’s eyes shone with delight as she moved closer to the holograms, studying them intently. “They are wonderful,” she murmured, “but do they have my shine, my sparkle?” Dr. Lysara smiled, anticipating the question. With another swipe of her hand across the panel, an image appeared of a creature covered in shimmering scales that reflected the light of its binary suns. “While not exactly like you, these creatures from Cygara II share your gift for radiance. They communicate through pulses of light from their scintillating scales.” Eager to learn more, Gloopy and Glitter listened to Dr. Lysara as she described the diversity of life in the universe, each story revealing more about the extraordinary inhabitants of distant worlds. It was a comforting confirmation that, in the vastness of the cosmos, there was room for all manner of existence. The meeting with Dr. Lysara left Gloopy and Glitter with a renewed sense of wonder and belonging. While they might be unique in their exact composition, they were connected to a wider community of extraordinary beings across the universe—all of whom contributed to the beautiful tapestry of cosmic life. And as they left the laboratory, their minds ablaze with thoughts of their newfound interstellar kin, Gloopy and Glitter returned to their spaceship more determined than ever to continue their adventures, seeking out new friends and knowledge among the stars. It appears that your message is empty. How may I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information on a topic, feel free to ask! Write a story where they meet a Sylopod In the vast tapestry of the cosmos, Gloopy and Glitter traversed the celestial highways in search of kindred spirits, alien creatures who, like them, defied the conventional boundaries of life forms. Their journey took them to Aquarion Prime, a planet renowned for its expansive oceans and the mysterious beings that dwelled within its depths. Upon arriving at the planet, enveloped by the serene blue of Aquarion Prime’s waters, Gloopy and Glitter decided to explore the oceanic world. Glitter twinkled with excitement, her fuschia hue shimmering against the tranquil backdrop of the water world. They undulated gracefully through the aquatic environment, Gloopy’s teal body adapting effortlessly to the fluid nature of the planet, changing his shape to navigate the currents. Glitter, ever effervescent, trailed sparkling bubbles behind her as she moved. It wasn’t long before they encountered a local inhabitant, a Sylopod as Dr. Lysara had described. The creature appeared as a rolling mass of gelatinous substance, constantly shifting its shape as it roamed the liquid landscape of its home planet. Its body was a brilliant turquoise shade, not unlike Gloopy’s own, and it moved with a flowing elegance that captivated the pair. “Greetings, noble traveler of the waters!” Gloopy called out, hailing the creature in the most cordial tone his gelatinous voice could muster. The Sylopod paused its perpetual motion, the undulations of its body slowing as it regarded the two newcomers with curiosity. It did not possess eyes or a face as they understood, but it was clear that the creature was aware of their presence. “We are explorers from far afield, on a quest to meet others like ourselves,” Glitter explained, projecting warmth and friendliness. “May we know more about you and your kind?” In response, the Sylopod began to pulsate rhythmically, sending out gentle waves that resonated through the water. Gloopy and Glitter soon realized that this was the Sylopod’s way of communicating. The vibrations carried intricate patterns and subtle nuances—a language of movement and gesture. Glitter, who was naturally attuned to the vibrations through her own sparkling form, began to interpret the movements. “It says that they are the Sylopods, the dancers of the tides, who shape the seabed with their movements and speak through the waves,” she relayed to Gloopy. The Sylopod continued to pulse, and as understanding bloomed, Gloopy and Glitter joined in the aquatic dance. Gloopy extended parts of his body, bending and twisting to mimic the Sylopod’s fluidity, while Glitter’s radiance flickered in tune to the rhythms of the ocean. Through shared silence and movement, an exchange of stories ensued. The Sylopod’s undulations told tales of ancient civilizations buried beneath the sea and of starlit nights where the ocean’s surface mirrored the heavens above. Gloopy and Glitter, in turn, shared their adventures across the stars and their desire to connect with beings of all walks of life. As they danced, they became fellow travelers in spirit, united by the universal bond of empathy and curiosity that transcends language and form. The encounter with the Sylopod enriched Gloopy and Glitter’s understanding of life’s diversity and the myriad ways in which beings could exist and express themselves. With heartfelt gestures of gratitude and friendship, Gloopy and Glitter bid the Sylopod farewell, their hearts swelling with the joy of a new connection made. They continued on their journey, eager for the next encounter and the stories it would bring, their resolve to embrace the unknown as boundless as the seas of Aquarion Prime. Write a story where the scientist organises a meeting of amorphous, gelatinous creatures like Gloopy, Hi Hello! How can I help you today? Is there a topic you’re interested in or a question I can answer for you? Hi Greetings! How may I assist you today? If you have any questions or topics you’d like to learn about, feel free to share them, and I’ll do my best to help. Write the story I asked for Certainly! Apologies for the oversight. Here’s your story. — In the heart of the Andromeda Galaxy, Dr. Lysara, the interstellar scientist with a passion for xenobiology, had a vision: a grand assembly of the galaxy’s most extraordinary amorphous and gelatinous life forms. Gloopy, with his unique ability to shape-shift, was at the center of this vision. The meeting was to be held on a neutral space station, a hub of multicultural and multi-species research, chosen for its state-of-the-art facilities that could accommodate various environmental requirements. Dr. Lysara sent out the invitations, encoded in a spectrum of frequencies and languages, ensuring that they reached every corner of known space where such creatures might reside. When Gloopy received the invitation, he buzzed with excitement. “Glitter, look! We’ve been invited to a gathering of beings just like me!” he exclaimed. Glitter’s sparkle intensified, thrilled at the prospect of meeting others with similar constitutions to her best friend. “This is going to be fascinating, Gloopy! We must go!” As they approached the space station, it was already abuzz with activity. The hangar held a myriad of ships, pods, and other forms of interstellar transportation. Inside, the air was teeming with anticipation, as creatures of all shapes and textures floated, slid, and bounced throughout the venue. Dr. Lysara greeted them personally. “Welcome, Gloopy, Glitter,” she said warmly. “I’m delighted that you could be here among your peers.” The venue was vast, with sections of the room catering to different environmental needs. There were pools for aquatic life, dry zones for more viscous beings, and humid areas for those who thrived in moisture. The temperature, lighting, and even the gravity were finely tuned to ensure comfort for all guests. As Gloopy and Glitter mingled, they met an astonishing variety of entities. There was the Sli’therin from a moon of Jupiter, whose body could split and recombine at will. They encountered Blorbs from the depths of Sigma Draconis, who communicated by changing colors and emitting soft phosphorescent glows. A particularly memorable introduction was with the Jelloxians, a group of emerald-shaded, communal-minded beings who could connect together to form larger structures, sharing thoughts and experiences fluidly among themselves. Each species shared a unique story of their evolution, their culture, and how they adapted to their respective environments. They discussed the struggles they faced upon encountering beings with more rigid body structures who often misunderstood their fluid nature. Gloopy and Glitter told tales of their travels and the friends they had made, reinforcing the idea that diversity among life forms is a strength and not a weakness. Throughout the meeting, Dr. Lysara took notes, her eyes gleaming with the excitement of a child as her own understanding of the galaxy’s life forms expanded exponentially. “This assembly is more than just a social gathering; it’s a milestone for interspecies understanding and acceptance,” she said during her closing speech. As the event came to a close, the attendees agreed to keep the channels of communication open, forging what would become a network of amorphous and gelatinous entities. It would be a repository of knowledge, a support system, and most importantly, a testament to the power of shared existence and mutual respect. Gloopy and Glitter left the meeting with a sense of pride and a deeper appreciation for their own unique forms. They had become a part of something much larger than themselves—a cosmic community of malleable marvels, each with their story woven into the beautiful tapestry of life’s rich tapestry across the stars. Write a story where they go to that Jupiter moon and see the creature for themselves The excitement was palpable as Gloopy and Glitter set course for Jupiter’s moon, a place they had learned about during the grand assembly organized by Dr. Lysara. They had been fascinated by tales of the Sli’therin, mysterious creatures who could split and recombine with apparent ease, and were eager to witness such phenomena for themselves. As their spacecraft entered Jupiter’s gravitational pull, they were treated to a spectacular view of the gas giant, its swirling storms and iconic Great Red Spot commanding awe and respect. They circled around to the lesser-known moon, which shimmered with a haunting glow, thanks to the reflected light from Jupiter’s immense presence. This was to be their destination. Upon landing, Gloopy and Glitter were greeted by a host member of the Sli’therin, who had welcomed them from the assembly via interstellar communications. The creature appeared like a fluctuating river of deep blue, with hints of silver that reflected the ambient light of the cavernous terrain they occupied. “Welcome, friends from afar,” the Sli’therin host communicated through vibrations, its fluid form undulating with each pulse of sound. “We are honored to have you explore our home.” Gloopy responded, reshaping his form to mimic courtesy in Sli’therin fashion, “We are the ones honored by your invitation. We look forward to learning about your ways.” Glitter, shimmering ever so brightly in the lesser light of the moon, added, “Your ability to split and recombine is truly wondrous. We’re eager to witness it ourselves.” The Sli’therin host began to guide them across the surface of the moon, with Gloopy and Glitter following curiously. The landscape was a mix of craggy rocks and ice, with pockets of bioluminescent flora casting a soft, ethereal light on the moon’s surface. Soon, they arrived at a vast, open space where many Sli’therins were gathered. “Gaze upon our community,” the host gestured. Before their eyes, the Sli’therins performed what could only be described as an exquisite ballet. Individual beings flowed together, merging into larger, communal forms before splitting apart again, each division a dance of intricate beauty. “The Sli’therin are singular and plural all at once,” the host explained. “We share knowledge, memories, and experiences among ourselves. This ability has helped us to survive and thrive in environments that others might find untenable.” Gloopy, intrigued, asked, “May I try to merge with you, to share an experience of understanding?” The Sli’therin host responded with an affirmative ripple. Approaching Gloopy, the Sli’therin flowed around him, and the two entities momentarily became one. Amidst this communion, Gloopy was overcome with a myriad of thoughts and emotions, not all his own—a feeling of connectedness unparalleled by anything he had ever experienced. When the Sli’therin retracted, leaving Gloopy once again distinct, he reformed slowly, visibly moved by the experience. “That was… profound,” Gloopy managed to shape out his words amid his fluctuating form. Glitter, observing the metamorphosis and exchange of existential essence, felt a surge of longing. Although she could not merge as Gloopy had, the unity and understanding demonstrated by the Sli’therin resonated deeply within her. The visit continued with the Sli’therin showcasing their ability to adapt and transform to tackle numerous challenges on their moon—a testament to the ingenuity of their species. Gloopy and Glitter witnessed the collaborative construction of shelters and storage facilities, each structure as fluid and functional as its builders. As the time came for Gloopy and Glitter to depart, their hearts and minds were brimming with new insights. The dance of the Sli’therin was etched into their memories, as was the feeling of oneness Gloopy had shared with the host. “Thank you for this gift of knowledge,” Glitter said, casting a radiant glow on their new friends. “We will carry the lessons of your unity and resilience with us,” Gloopy added, his form solidifying with renewed purpose. With heartfelt goodbyes exchanged, Gloopy and Glitter took to the stars once more, the moon of Jupiter diminishing in the distance behind them. Their adventure had been one of discovery and connection, a reminder that the cosmos was vast, but even its most elusive mysteries could be touched by the bond of shared understanding and friendship. Write about the Sli,therin’s appearance The Sli’therin were inhabitants of a lesser-known moon orbiting the gas giant Jupiter, a species of remarkable fluidity and harmony. From a distance, a Sli’therin might appear as a serene stream of liquid, imbued with the deep blue hue of the midnight ocean with hints of silver that captured and reflected any sliver of light that reached the moon’s surface. These colors provided a natural camouflage against the icy and rock-strewn landscapes they called home. Up close, one could see that the Sli’therin’s body was a constantly shifting tapestry of patterns and textures. Their form resembled terrestrial liquid but with a viscosity and coherency that betrayed a more complex biological makeup. The silvery flecks within their substance twinkled like stars, an effect that became more pronounced when they moved or communicated. They lacked traditional features such as eyes, ears, or mouths. Instead, the Sli’therin’s entire form was a sensory organ, capable of perceiving their environment in exquisite detail. Their means of communication was primarily through vibrations, which sent ripples across their bodies. These ripples were not random but highly patterned, allowing for a rich exchange of ideas and emotions through a kind of kinesthetic language. The Sli’therin had the astonishing ability to split and merge at will—a characteristic that defined their unique physiology. When they chose to divide, their body would undulate and form a crease down the middle, gradually deepening until two new, fully functional Sli’therins emerged from the division. The process was smooth and seemed effortless, reflecting a sophisticated biological control over their own molecular cohesion. Conversely, when the Sli’therin merged, they did so with a grace that was almost ceremonial. It was an intimate act, with two or more beings flowing into each other, their boundaries dissolving until they became a larger, communal entity. In this state, they would share collective consciousness and experiences—a form of social communion that strengthened their bonds and allowed them to exist as both individuals and as an interconnected community. The fusion of several Sli’therins created a more massive form that managed to retain the elegance of the single beings. Together, they could create complex structures or solve problems that were challenging for an individual. The temporary unions were strategic, formed for social, survival, or constructive purposes, and once their goal was reached, they would seamlessly split back into independent Sli’therins. The Sli’therin’s remarkable qualities made them one of the most fascinating species in the cosmos. Observers often found themselves entranced by the Sli’therin’s hypnotic movements and the refined dance of their existence—a living testament to the infinite possibilities of life’s expressions within the vast universe. Write a story where they uncover a secret that could have destroyed the universe millions of years ago In the quiet expanse of the universe, amidst a sea of stars and swirling galaxies, stood Gloopy and Glitter, embarked upon an adventure that would soon reveal a secret buried in the depths of cosmic history. Their journey had taken them to a derelict space station orbiting an ancient, dying star, following a map encrypted in a mysterious artifact they had discovered on their travels. The station, a forgotten relic of an advanced civilization long extinct, hid within its core archives of knowledge and history unparalleled by any known to the current denizens of the stars. As Gloopy and Glitter ventured deeper into the station’s labyrinthine corridors, they stumbled upon a sealed chamber, its door etched with symbols that pulsed with a faint, ethereal light. Using the artifact as a key, they unlocked the chamber, revealing an archive that contained the collective wisdom and memories of civilizations that spanned back to the dawn of the universe. Among these memories, they found a harrowing tale of a force that nearly unraveled the fabric of existence itself. Millions of years ago, when the universe was still young and tumultuous, a coalition of ancient civilizations discovered the existence of an anomaly at the heart of the cosmos—a singularity not bound by the laws of physics as understood. This singularity, born from the confluence of dark energies and matter, had the potential to expand uncontrollably, devouring the universe and collapsing it into a void of nothingness. Horrified by this discovery, the coalition devised a plan to contain the anomaly. They constructed a device of unimaginable power, capable of bending the very fabric of space and time. This device would create a pocket universe, into which the anomaly could be sealed away, isolated from the rest of existence. With the combined efforts of the greatest minds and resources at their disposal, the coalition enacted their plan. The singularity was drawn into the pocket universe, successfully averting the catastrophe. But the effort cost them dearly. The strain of containing such a force tore apart the fabric of their own civilizations, leading to their eventual decline and extinction. Gloopy and Glitter listened with bated breath as the archive’s holographic projections recounted this tale, the weight of the secret they had uncovered dawning upon them. They realized the importance of this knowledge, a reminder of the dangers that lurked in the unseen corners of the universe, and the sacrifices made to preserve life and existence. Determined that the sacrifice of those ancient civilizations would not be forgotten, they copied the archive’s contents onto the artifact, intending to share this knowledge with the current leaders of the galactic community. Their hope was to ensure that the universe remained vigilant against such threats and that the unity demonstrated by the coalition could serve as an inspiration for species across the cosmos. As Gloopy and Glitter set off from the space station, the artifact in their possession pulsing with the light of a million stars, they knew they were no longer just travelers exploring the wonders of the universe. They had become keepers of its history, guardians of a secret that held the key to its continued survival. Their journey back to the heart of the civilized galaxy was filled with purpose, their resolve unshakeable. They were ready to face any challenge, knowing that the story they carried could change the course of history and ensure the safety of countless generations to come. The universe, vast and mysterious, stretched out before them, its secrets now a little less daunting, thanks to the courage and curiosity of two unlikely heroes. Write a story where they talk to each other about what they just witnessed After departing the ancient space station, Gloopy and Glitter charted a course for a quiet nebula, a place where they could reflect on the monumental discovery they had just made. The nebula, with its swirling clouds of gas and dust, bathed their spacecraft in a gentle luminescence, creating an atmosphere of calm and introspection. As they drifted through the cosmic ballet of lights and colors, Gloopy broke the silence, his voice tinged with a mix of awe and concern. “Glitter, can you believe what we just found? An entire archive of civilizations lost to time, and that secret… it’s almost too much to comprehend.” Glitter, still processing the weight of the revelation, shimmered softly, her light reflecting her thoughtful mood. “I know, Gloopy. It’s overwhelming. The thought that the universe once teetered on the brink of oblivion, and we had no idea.” Her voice trailed off, lost in the magnitude of what they had learned. Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage towards Glitter, a gesture of comfort. “It’s scary, but it also shows how much those before us cared about life, about preserving the future. They worked together, despite their differences, to save everything. It’s… it’s inspiring.” “Yes, it is,” Glitter agreed, her glow brightening slightly. “It makes me think about our own place in the universe. We’re just two beings among trillions, but today, we’ve become part of something so much bigger. We carry their story, their legacy.” Gloopy nodded, his form shifting as he absorbed the gravity of their conversation. “What do you think we should do with this knowledge? The danger of the singularity might be gone, but the lessons from it shouldn’t be lost.” Glitter was silent for a moment before responding, “We need to share it, Gloopy. Not to spread fear, but to foster unity. To show the current and future generations that working together, considering others’ survival as your own, is the key to safeguarding against threats, seen and unseen.” There was a pause as both contemplated the path ahead, the responsibility that lay upon their slimy and sparkly shoulders. Gloopy finally spoke, determination firm in his voice. “Then let’s make a plan. We’ll start by compiling the data in a way that’s understandable to all. Next, we can reach out to the Galactic Council. They have the means to spread this message to every corner of known space.” “And we’ll tell the story ourselves too,” added Glitter, her light pulsing with resolve. “Everywhere we go, we’ll share what we’ve learned. We’ll be ambassadors of unity, just like those ancient civilizations were.” The two friends spent hours discussing their plan, refining their message, and preparing for the journey ahead. They knew it wouldn’t be easy, that there might be those who doubted them or the importance of their discovery. But they also knew they had each other, and the wisdom of the ages behind them. As they set a course away from the nebula, heading towards the bustling lanes of interstellar civilization, Gloopy and Glitter looked out into the vast expanse of the universe. It was a place of endless mystery and potential danger, but also of boundless hope and unity. Armed with the knowledge of the past, they were ready to face the future, whatever it might hold. Thread Title: Squish Cartoon Coming to Kids WB! Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment.

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime.

Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning.

DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids!

New Shows + Fresh GoGoRiki Episodes! 🍁📺 AnimeAdventurer101: Just in, 4Kids is eyeing a full anime assault this Fall! “Demon Slayer,” which they’re rebranding as “Vampire Hunters,” is coming despite expected heavy censorship. We’re also getting “Smile Precure” under the guise of “Glitter Force,” and “Yo-Kai Watch” is making a splash. Plus, new “GoGoRiki” episodes on the horizon! ToonMasterJay: “Vampire Hunters” better not be sliced and diced to oblivion; “Demon Slayer” thrives on its action! But knowing 4Kids, our expectations for uncensored content should be—well, tempered. Hopefully, they keep enough of the original spirit intact. DigitalToonFan: “Glitter Force,” huh? Reminds me of their old “Sailor Moon” days. “Smile Precure” is a great series, so I’m curious how much will be changed. As long as the essence is there, I suppose it’ll capture the audience it’s meant for. GoGoFan223: More GoGoRiki, sign me up! That show has been a surprisingly funny sleeper hit. It’s got its own quirky charm that’s been keeping kids and some of us adults entertained. MangaMogul: Alright, “Yo-Kai Watch” making the fall line-up is sweet. I’m cautiously optimistic about how it will be adapted. It has a lot of cultural references that I hope don’t get lost in translation. SonicXforever: Honestly, I’m a mix of excited and nervous. The anime choices are solid, but we all remember how 4Kids framed other shows in the past. As long as they don’t stray too far from the source material, it could work out. PokeNostalgia101: Whoever pitched “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” deserves a… medal? It’s certainly a creative spin. Fingers crossed that “Yo-Kai Watch” retains its charm and doesn’t face the same fate. WebWader: It’s a major throwback to 4Kids’ old strategies—rebranding anime with Western sensibilities. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not so much. Here’s hoping for the former this time around without losing too much authenticity. ComicStripKid: “Glitter Force,” eh? We’ll see. It’s gotta be a tricky balance of keeping the action-friendly for younger audiences while not alienating the fans. And yo, new GoGoRiki episodes—those character designs just stick with you. LyokoLover: 4Kids and anime have a… complicated history. But I’m here for the anime, so I’ll give “Vampire Hunters” and “Glitter Force” a chance. As for “Yo-Kai Watch,” it could be a hit if handled with care. ToonTalker91: The anime announcements have potential, but the true test will be the execution. “Demon Slayer” is huge, so even a watered-down “Vampire Hunters” might hook viewers. Excited for new GoGoRiki eps and curious about “Glitter Force” as well. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’ve heard your concerns and your excitement! Stick with us as we dive into Fall’s diverse programming, which will definitely include fan-favorite anime action and some fantastic comedy. Changes can be good—especially with new GoGoRiki episodes on the way. Stay tuned!

Post: Hey everyone, I need help remembering this cartoon I used to watch in the early 2020s. It was during the time when Kids WB transitioned over to CW4Kids and then was taken over by 4Kids. It featured a duo of slimy, blob-like creatures. The male one was definitely a teal color, if I remember correctly. This show was pretty unique because it managed to survive the entire transformation over to 4Kids, which was a period that saw a lot of shows getting replaced or shuffled around. I remember it being light-hearted with some funny and cute moments between the two main characters. The female character was all sparkly or glittery, I think? They got into all sorts of adventures, and it had a pretty positive vibe overall. For the life of me, I can't recall the name of the show, and it's driving me crazy! Does anyone else remember this show or am I just imagining things? It was one of the few constants in that time of lots of channel changes, and I'd love to find it again. Thanks in advance!"},{"prompt":"Write a reply saying he's not imagining, and it was one of 2 shows to survive the changeover, and say the other","completion":"Reply: You're definitely not imagining things! The show you're talking about is called \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" Gloopy was the teal blob you remember, and Glitter was his sparkling, fuchsia-colored friend. It was indeed one of the two shows to survive the entire transition from Kids WB to CW4Kids and finally under the 4Kids banner. The blend of humor, friendship, and adventures made it a standout during a time of great change on the channel. The other show that managed to make it through the transitions alongside \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" was \\"Code Lyoko.\\" While \\"Code Lyoko\\" had a more action-oriented, virtual world theme, both shows retained their fan base and continued to air, offering some stability and continuity for viewers during those shifting times. It's great to hear that \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" left such a positive impression. Both shows have their own charm and offered something unique to the audience of that era."},{"prompt":"Write a reply where he remembers another show he used to watch, that sadly didn't make it, All he remembers was \\"One was about an amoeba, the other was about a group of daredevils\\" and that both left on the same day","completion":"Reply: Ah, now that you mention it, I remember those shows too! It sounds like you're talking about \\"Squish,\\" which centered around a fun-loving amoeba and his microbial friends going on adventures, and \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,\\" a show about three daredevil brothers performing over-the-top stunts around the world. Both were quite entertaining in their own right, \\"Squish\\" for its unique take on the microscopic world and \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\\" for their wild and wacky escapades. Sadly, as you've recalled correctly, both shows were taken off the air on the same day, which was a huge disappointment for fans. \\"Squish\\" had a great educational element, subtly teaching viewers about science and biology, while \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\\" was just pure, exhilarating fun. It was a bittersweet day when we had to say goodbye to both these quirky and beloved shows. Their departure marked the end of an era and the beginning of the many changes that would come with the CW4Kids transition to 4Kids Entertainment. It's a shame they didn't make it through the changeover."},{"prompt":"Write a convo back in November 2024 where a user wonders if TAAB is returning, a user says it isn't but here's other shows instead","completion":"**Thread Title: Is \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\\" (TAAB) Returning? 🤔🎪** **CuriousCartoonFan:** Hey all, I've been hit with a wave of nostalgia recently and started thinking about \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.\\" With all the talk about shows making comebacks lately, does anyone know if TAAB is on the list for a return in 2024? Would love to see those daredevils back in action! **ToonTalker91:** As much as I loved TAAB and their over-the-top stunts, I haven't seen any news about a comeback for the Adrenalini brothers, unfortunately. It seems like they won't be returning to our screens anytime soon. 😞 But hey, the upside is that there are several other shows making their debut or coming back that might pique your interest. **NeoNostalgiaNerd:** Yeah, to build on what **ToonTalker91** said, even though TAAB isn't making a return, there's a bunch in the lineup that could fill that void. For example, \\"Galactic Gladiators\\" is shaping up to be an exciting blend of adventure and humor, taking place in a far-off galaxy with a band of unlikely heroes. Then there's \\"Mystery Island,\\" which packs that adventure punch with a group of kids solving mysteries on an island filled with secrets and strange creatures. While they're not the Adrenalini brothers, these shows carry a similar spirit of thrill and fun. **AnimationAficionado:** I'm in the same boat as **CuriousCartoonFan**, missing the unique charm of TAAB. Still, \\"Galactic Gladiators\\" and \\"Mystery Island\\" sound promising. The animation industry seems to be in a great phase of bringing forward dynamic content. It’s exciting to explore these new worlds they're creating, even though I'll always have a soft spot for Renato, Adi, and Enk. **RetroToonLover:** It's a bummer about TAAB, but I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing in animation. Those new shows **NeoNostalgiaNerd** mentioned sound like they've got potential. Also, don't forget to check out \\"Quantum Questers,\\" which has a bit of that old-school vibe with a modern twist – could be a hidden gem amidst the newcomers. **CuriousCartoonFan:** Thanks for the updates, everyone! While it's disappointing not to have TAAB back, I'm glad to hear there's a lot of fresh content to look forward to. \\"Galactic Gladiators\\" and \\"Mystery Island\\" definitely caught my attention.

I’ve got mixed feelings since this means we’re saying goodbye to \\"Tomodachi Life.\\" Heard it might have something to do with Nintendo distancing itself from the 3DS era. Thoughts? **PixelPundit:** Honestly? It's bittersweet. \\"Tomodachi Life\\" had its charm, capturing that quirky spirit of the game. But it seems like Nintendo is indeed moving on from the 3DS legacy, focusing on future projects. On the flip side, TAOG&G has been gaining quite a fanbase, so it’s exciting to see it get more airtime, especially on a platform like 24/7 4KidsTV. **RetroRaver:** You know, \\"Tomodachi Life\\" felt like a niche gem that hit just the right notes for fans of the game. Its departure is a loss for those of us who enjoy seeing our favorite games animated. That said, \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" is delightful.

However, TAOG&G is fantastically engaging, and its upcoming move to the 24/7 4KidsTV highlights its success and adaptability.

There’s something absolutely hypnotic about the fluidity and near-liquid grace with which slime characters are brought to life on screen. From the undulating waves to the way they split and recombine with such seamless transitions, it’s like watching a dance between the laws of physics and pure fantasy. I’ve found myself pausing and replaying scenes just to appreciate the incredible detail and care animators put into creating these lifelike movements. Take, for instance, the way “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” handles its two titular characters. Gloopy, with his teal, gelatinous body, moves with a sort of lazy flow that’s both calming and endlessly fascinating to watch. And don’t even get me started on Glitter, whose sparkling, viscous form adds an entirely new layer of complexity to the animation. The way light reflects off her and changes as she moves is just... *chef's kiss*. It’s not just about how cool these animations look, either. There’s a lot of science and artistry that goes into making something technically non-living feel so full of personality and life. It challenges our perceptions and expectations, turning a simple slime blob into a character we can root for, laugh with, and even relate to. Is anyone else as enamored with slime animations as I am? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any examples of slime animation that have caught your eye. Maybe you’re an animator yourself and have some insights into what goes into creating these mesmerizing movements. Let's dive into this gooey goodness together! --- **Comments:** **u/ArtfulSculptor:** Absolutely agree! The fluid dynamics involved in creating realistic slime movement must be incredibly challenging but so rewarding to get right. It’s the perfect blend of physics and creativity. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” does an outstanding job. **u/PhysicsNerd123:** Have you seen the breakdowns on how they simulate slime physics in animation? It’s mind-blowing! Some studios use advanced particle systems and fluid dynamics simulations just to get that perfect slime wiggle. **u/GlitterFanatic:** Glitter's animations are my favorite! The way they manage to combine the fluid movement with the glimmering effect is magical. It really does add depth to her character beyond just being, well, a sparkly slime! **u/DigitalDreamweaver:** Does anyone else find watching slime animations oddly therapeutic? There’s something so calming about the way they move. Plus, the creativity involved in bringing these characters to life is truly inspiring."},{"prompt":"Write a reddit post detailing things she likes about Glitter's appearance,","completion":"**Title: Let's Talk About Glitter's Dazzling Design in \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" ✨** **Post by u/StarlightSpectator:** Hey r/CharacterDesign and fellow \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" enthusiasts! I’ve been absolutely enchanted by Glitter’s character design ever since the show debuted. There's so much to admire, from her vivid color scheme to the intricate way her sparkling essence is animated. I wanted to share some of the details and aspects of her appearance that really stand out to me and see if anyone else feels the same or has other points to add! **1. Sparkling Visual Effects:** First and foremost, the sparkling effect that encapsulates Glitter is mesmerizing. The way the animators have managed to integrate a continuous shimmer into her movement is nothing short of magical. It genuinely makes her seem like she’s made of starlight or some ethereal substance. **2. Color Palette:** Glitter’s color scheme is absolutely eye-catching. The choice of vibrant fuschia mixed with softer pinks and occasional bursts of different hues to reflect her mood or the light around her showcases a wonderful depth to her character’s visual representation. **3. Expressive Eyes:** Despite her being a slime creature, Glitter’s eyes are incredibly expressive. It’s amazing how much emotion the creators can convey through those sparkly eyes, whether it’s excitement, sadness, or mischief. Her eyes are like windows to her gooey soul. **4. Fluidity and Form:** Slime characters can risk being overly simple in design, but Glitter breaks the mold. Her ability to change shape, combined with her naturally flowing, glittery form, adds a dynamic aspect to her appearance. This fluidity allows for creative expression in the show, from the way she emotes to how she interacts with her environment. **5. The Glimmer Effect When Moving:** This deserves its own mention. As Glitter moves, her body leaves behind a subtle trail of sparkles, which accentuates her movements and makes every action she takes feel special and impactful. This glimmer effect is not just beautiful but contributes to her unique identity among the show's characters. I find myself continually impressed by the attention to detail in Glitter's design and how it contributes to her character's charm and appeal. In a world of animated characters, Glitter truly stands out as a testament to creative and thoughtful design. **What are your thoughts on Glitter's design? Is there a particular aspect you love or something you think could have been done differently? Let's discuss and celebrate this wonderfully designed character together!** --- **Comments:** **u/GlitteringGuardian:** Her sparkles are what drew me to the show! It’s like watching a walking disco ball, but in the best way possible. It brightens up every scene she’s in. **u/DesignDynamo:** Completely agree on the fluidity and form point. The way Glitter can reshape yet maintain her sparkly essence is a fantastic execution of character design that’s not bound by the usual physical constraints. **u/PixelPerfectPatty:** Did anyone notice how the environment reflects off her sometimes? It’s such a subtle touch but adds so much realism to her sparkling form. Kudos to the animators! **u/MagicalMuser:** Glitter's design is the perfect combination of fantasy and personality. She's not just “another slime character”—her sparkles, her eyes, everything about her design screams uniqueness and charisma."},{"prompt":"Write a TVTropes - Blob Creature section about them","completion":"**TV Tropes Entry: Blob Creature** Blob creatures, while seemingly simple in concept, come in an astonishing variety of forms across media, embodying everything from the grotesque to the endearing. Among the myriad of blobby beings, two standout characters from the animated realm are Gloopy and Glitter, the titular stars of \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" These two take the blob creature trope and spin it in a family-friendly, entertaining, and sometimes educational direction. # Main Page: Blob Creature - **Definition**: Blob creatures in fiction are typically depicted as amorphous, gelatinous entities that can change shape, absorb objects, or even split and merge at will. They range from horror genre monsters to comedic or whimsical characters designed to appeal to a younger audience. # Subsection: Endearing Slime Duo - Gloopy and Glitter - **Gloopy**: Gloopy personifies the more traditional aspect of blob creatures with his teal, amorphous body that squishes and stretches in delightful or comedic ways. Unlike his horror-genre counterparts, Gloopy's ability to reshape himself is often used for humor, problem-solving, or expressing emotion, demonstrating the trope's versatility. - **Glitter**: As Gloopy's sparkly counterpart, Glitter pushes the boundaries of the blob creature trope with her glittering, viscous form that captures the light in mesmerizing patterns. Her design takes the concept of a gelatinous being and adds an element of visual wonder, showing that blob creatures in animation can have an aesthetic appeal beyond their shape-shifting antics. - **Unique Abilities**: Both characters showcase unique abilities that play into storylines, with Gloopy's elastic body allowing him to bounce out of trouble, while Glitter can use her sparkling body to distract antagonists or light up dark places, adding utility to their forms that go beyond mere physical comedy. - **Environmental Interaction**: One aspect that sets Gloopy and Glitter apart from other blob creatures is how they interact with their surroundings. Gloopy can ooze through tight spaces or envelop objects, while Glitter's shiny particles can adhere to and highlight different objects, making their environment a canvas for their adventures. - **Emotive Expression**: Despite being blobs, Gloopy and Glitter exhibit a wide range of emotions, challenging the notion that such simple forms can't convey complex feelings. Their elasticity and ability to change shape at will are cleverly used to demonstrate everything from joy to sadness, adding depth to their characters. - **Educational Content**: \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" often incorporates educational content, subtly introducing concepts like physics (through Gloopy's bounces and stretches) and even the basics of optics (as seen with Glitter's interaction with light). By infusing learning into their narratives, the show demonstrates how blob creatures can be more than entertaining; they can also be vehicles for teaching. # Reception and Legacy The reception to Gloopy and Glitter has been overwhelmingly positive, with audiences appreciating their design, the innovative use of their blob-like forms, and the balance of entertainment with educational content. As blob creatures, they stand as a testament to creative character design, proving that even the simplest forms can be brimming with personality, utility, and the capacity to engage audiences on multiple levels. In essence, Gloopy and Glitter contribute to the evolution of the blob creature trope from mere monsters or sidekicks to fully realized characters capable of carrying a show through a combination of visual creativity, expressiveness, and narrative utility. Through their adventures, they remind viewers of the endless possibilities animation provides in reimagining what a 'blob creature' can be."},{"prompt":"a menina desmarcou e deu desculpa em cima da hora 3 vezes seguidas devo desistir","completion":"Se uma pessoa cancelou planos com você em cima da hora por três vezes seguidas, é compreensível que você esteja sentindo frustração ou até mesmo se perguntando sobre a sinceridade ou o interesse dela em você ou no compromisso proposto.

Garanta que está buscando relacionamentos e conexões que o façam sentir valorizado e respeitado.

Quando alguém cancela planos repetidamente, especialmente em cima da hora, é natural questionar o seu interesse e comprometimento. Aqui estão alguns pontos para você ponderar que podem te ajudar a decidir o próximo passo: 1. **Padrão de Comportamento**: Se isso se tornou um padrão, é importante avaliar se a outra pessoa está realmente interessada em manter um relacionamento (seja ele de amizade ou algo mais) com você. Comportamentos repetitivos podem indicar falta de respeito pelo seu tempo ou, talvez, que ela tenha prioridades diferentes neste momento. 2. **Comunicação Aberta**: Uma conversa franca pode esclarecer muitas coisas. Talvez expressar como você se sente em relação aos cancelamentos possa abrir um diálogo sobre o que ambos esperam dessa relação. Ela pode ter razões legítimas para seus cancelamentos, mas é importante que a comunicação seja clara de ambos os lados. 3. **Considere suas Próprias Necessidades e Limites**: Avalie o que você está disposto a tolerar em um relacionamento.

Se decidir dar outra chance, estabeleça limites claros. Se decidir que é hora de seguir em frente, saiba que é uma decisão válida também. Decisões como essa nunca são fáceis, especialmente quando há sentimentos envolvidos. No entanto, respeitar a si mesmo e seus próprios limites é fundamental.

Aqui estão algumas considerações que podem ajudá-lo a tomar essa decisão: # Avalie a Situação - **As Desculpas São Justificáveis?** Considere se as razões apresentadas para os cancelamentos são compreensíveis e se a pessoa parece genuinamente arrependida. - **Padrão de Comportamento:** Isso é um incidente isolado ou faz parte de um padrão de comportamento maior? Se cancelamentos de última hora se tornaram uma norma, isso pode indicar falta de respeito pelo seu tempo. - **Comunicação:** A pessoa tentou reagendar ou demonstrou interesse em encontrar outra oportunidade para se verem? A comunicação é um componente importante de qualquer relacionamento. - **Seus Sentimentos:** Reflita sobre como esses cancelamentos estão afetando você emocionalmente. Eles te deixam chateado, ansioso, ou questionando seu próprio valor? # Comunique-se - **Expressar Sentimentos:** Considere ter uma conversa aberta sobre como esses cancelamentos estão afetando seus sentimentos em relação à relação. A honestidade pode esclarecer mal-entendidos e abrir espaço para melhorias. # Decida Baseado no que é Melhor para Você - **Autovalorização:** Lembre-se de que você merece respeito e consideração. Se você sente que seus sentimentos e tempo não estão sendo valorizados, pode ser hora de reavaliar sua disposição em continuar investindo nesse relacionamento. - **Possibilidade de Mudança:** Avalie se você acredita que o comportamento da pessoa pode mudar com o tempo ou se você está disposto a aceitar esse tipo de comportamento a longo prazo. - **Alternativas:** Pergunte-se se seus esforços e energia poderiam ser melhor direcionados para outras pessoas/atividades que trazem alegria e satisfação para sua vida. - **Saúde Mental:** Considere como essa situação está afetando sua saúde mental. Se está causando mais estresse e negatividade do que positividade, talvez seja hora de se afastar. Se decide desistir ou não, é importante que essa decisão seja feita considerando o seu bem-estar e felicidade. Relações saudáveis são baseadas no respeito mútuo, comunicação e esforço conjunto."},{"prompt":"cenario hipotetico fiz 10000% fazendo trade de cripto tenho talento","completion":"Fazer 10.000% de lucro em operações de trading de criptomoedas é um feito notável em qualquer circunstância.

Эти \\"трансформеры\\" играют ключевую роль в работе таких систем, как GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), которые способны генерировать тексты, переводить языки, отвечать на вопросы и многое другое. # Основы трансформеров: **1. Что такое трансформеры?** Проще говоря, трансформеры – это модели глубокого обучения, которые умеют обрабатывать последовательности данных, например, текст. Они делают это, учитывая контекст каждого элемента в последовательности, будь то слово в предложении или даже символ. **2. Механизм внимания (Attention Mechanism):** Самое крутое в трансформерах – это механизм внимания. Эта штука позволяет модели \\"сосредотачиваться\\" на важных частях текста и лучше понимать, как слова связаны друг с другом, не зависимо от их расположения в тексте. Это как когда ты читаешь текст, и твой мозг автоматически выделяет и запоминает ключевые факты, игнорируя неважную информацию. **3. Длина контекста:** Длина контекста – это фактически количество информации, которое модель может \\"помнить\\" или учитывать одновременно. Для больших языковых моделей (LLM) типа GPT-3, \\"память\\" модели может включать тысячи слов, что позволяет ей учитывать достаточно большой контекст при генерации текста. Это немного похоже на то, как если бы ты читал книгу и мог запоминать последние несколько глав целиком, а не только последнюю страницу, что делает понимание гораздо глубже. **Заключение:** Говоря простым языком, представь трансформеры как очень умных роботов, которые умеют читать и понимать текст похоже на человека. Они могут отлавливать связи между словами и идеями в тексте, даже если эти слова находятся далеко друг от друга. А длина контекста в этих моделях – это как объем рабочей памяти, который определяет, сколько текста они могут учитывать, делая выводы и генерируя новый текст."},{"prompt":"а теперь давай код с подробными комментариями как и почему, код для тренировки и использования модели","completion":"Создать и обучить свою модель трансформера с нуля — достаточно сложная задача, требующая значительных вычислительных ресурсов, но я покажу основной пример, используя библиотеку transformers от Hugging Face, которая значительно упрощает этот процесс.

Тем не менее, я могу дать вам базовый пример, как это можно сделать с помощью PyTorch. Помните, что эффективность такой модели будет сильно зависеть от объема и качества данных, на которых она обучается, а также от её архитектуры и параметров обучения. В данном примере мы создадим очень простую последовательную модель, которая учится предсказывать следующий токен в последовательности. Пример ниже не будет слишком сложным и не покроет все тонкости создания продуктовых LLM, но даст базовое представление о процессе. # Шаг 1: Установка PyTorch Если у вас еще не установлен PyTorch, сделайте это с официального сайта или через pip: \`\`\`bash pip install torch \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Создание модели Для создания собственной простой модели трансформера в PyTorch, нам понадобится определить класс модели: \`\`\`python import torch from torch import nn class SimpleTransformer(nn.Module): def __init__(self, token_size, max_len, emb_size, heads): super(SimpleTransformer, self).__init__() self.embed = nn.Embedding(token_size, emb_size) self.positional_encoding = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, max_len, emb_size)) self.transformer_block = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=emb_size, nhead=heads) self.outputs = nn.Linear(emb_size, token_size) def forward(self, x): x = self.embed(x) + self.positional_encoding[:, :x.size(1)] x = self.transformer_block(x) x = self.outputs(x) return x # token_size - размер словаря # max_len - максимальная длина последовательности # emb_size - размерность эмбеддингов # heads - количество \\"голов\\" в многоголовочном внимании \`\`\` Это очень упрощенная модель и многие детали (например, настоящее позиционное кодирование) не включены или упрощены. # Шаг 3: Подготовка данных Для тренировки модели вам нужен датасет. В этом примере мы будем использовать простой текстовый датасет, который нужно предварительно обработать: 1. Токенизировать текст. 2. Преобразовать токены в индексы. 3. Организовать данные в пары \\"входные данные - цель\\", где целью является следующий токен после данной последовательности токенов. # Шаг 4: Обучение модели После того как модель создана и данные подготовлены, можно переходить к обучению: \`\`\`python from torch.optim import Adam model = SimpleTransformer(token_size=10000, max_len=512, emb_size=512, heads=8) optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001) criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # Псевдокод для обучения, сами данные для обучения опущены для простоты for epoch in range(epochs): model.train() for data, target in train_loader: optimizer.zero_grad() output = model(data) loss = criterion(output.transpose(1, 2), target) # Транспонируем для cross entropy loss.backward() optimizer.step() print(f\\"Эпоха {epoch}, потери: {loss.item()}\\") \`\`\` # Важные моменты - Пример основан на предположении, что у вас есть базовые знания в PyTorch и общее понимание того, как работают нейронные сети. - В примере кода опущены многие детали, связанные с обработкой текста, такие как токенизация и индексация. - Создание эффективной большой языковой модели требует больших вычислительных ресурсов и тщательной настройки гиперпараметров. - Это лишь очень базовый пример, предназначенный для понимания концепции.

Учтем, что модель, которую мы рассмотрели, является упрощенной и не оптимизирована для генерации текста, но принципы, которые я покажу, применимы и для более сложных моделей. Важно понимать, что для генерации текста модель должна быть способной предсказывать следующий токен на основании предыдущего контекста. Вот как это может быть реализовано на практике: \`\`\`python import torch def generate_text(model, start_token, max_length): model.eval() # Переключаем модель в режим предсказания inputs = torch.tensor(start_token).unsqueeze(0) # Добавляем размерность пакета with torch.no_grad(): # Указываем, что градиенты не нужны for _ in range(max_length): outputs = model(inputs) # Получаем предсказания для последнего токена predictions = outputs[:, -1, :] # Выбираем токен с наивысшей вероятностью predicted_token = torch.argmax(predictions, dim=-1) # Добавляем предсказанный токен к входным данным для следующего шага inputs = torch.cat((inputs, predicted_token.unsqueeze(0)), dim=1) # Возвращаем сгенерированную последовательность токенов return inputs.squeeze().tolist() # Пример использования (здесь мы предполагаем, что у вас уже есть обученная модель) start_token = [tokenizer.encode(\\"The meaning of life\\")[0]] # Начальный токен (например, ID токена для начала предложения) max_length = 50 # Максимальная длина генерируемого текста generated_tokens = generate_text(model, start_token, max_length) generated_text = tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens) print(generated_text) \`\`\` # Важные моменты: - **Обработка входных данных:** Мы начинаем с некоторого начального текста (или токена), который передаем модели как первоначальный ввод. Этот текст токенизируется и преобразуется в соответствующие ID токенов. - **Генерация текста шаг за шагом:** На каждом шаге генерации используется текущий контекст (последовательность токенов), чтобы предсказать следующий токен. Предсказанный токен добавляется к контексту, и процесс повторяется до достижения заданной максимальной длины текста или до генерации токена конца текста. - **Выбор следующего токена:** В примере используется самый простой способ выбора следующего токена — выбирается токен с наибольшей вероятностью. Однако в реальной практике часто используют более сложные методы, такие как выборки или beam search, чтобы сделать генерацию текста более разнообразной и интересной. Это пример показывает базовую идею генерации текста с использованием модели трансформера. В реальных приложениях процесс может быть значительно усложнен для улучшения качества и разнообразия генерируемого текста."},{"prompt":"теперь давай сделай такое же только для модели которая будет генерировать состояния игры, а это 16640 чисел и длина контектста будет 100","completion":"Создание модели, которая генерирует состояния игры в виде 16,640 чисел на основе контекста из предыдущих 100 состояний, является более специфической и высоконагруженной задачей, чем предыдущие примеры.

Важно использовать кавалерию для прорывов в слабые места врага. - Армия 2, обладающая большей мобильностью и мощными существами, должна сосредоточиться на использовании своих превосходств в воздухе, маневренности и ударном потенциале драконов для нанесения максимального ущерба. **Вывод:** Имея в виду мощь и уникальные возможности армии 2, включая многоцелевую атаку гидр, огромную мощь драконов и маневренность кентавров и грифонов, всё это дает им существенное превосходство. Армия 1, несмотря на разнообразие и численность, будет иметь значительные трудности в сражении с высокомобильными и мощными юнитами армии 2. **Однозначный ответ:** Армия 2 имеет больше шансов на победу благодаря своей мобильности, мощи и уникальному составу существ, способных наносить колоссальные уроны как в дальнем, так и в ближнем бою."},{"prompt":"Write an interesting, riveting, drama-filled, action-packed, military-action-packed, magical action-filled dialogue-filled excerpt set in a cyberpunk, science fiction, high fantasy, science fantasy setting for a crossover fanfic between the Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai [Unbreakable Machine-Doll| Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai|] light novel, manga and anime franchise , the Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!

Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the 3 January 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute Imperial Royal parliamentary monarchy but de jure feudal royal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu's more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan |the sei-i taishōgun| during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 in Japanese history who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun's more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the collection of various powers that supported the bakufu and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun/sei-i taishōgun and nominally to the Japanese emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], [the Tokugawa bakufu] ruling [the Tokugawa bakufu] over Japan and Okinawa, [the Meiji Restoration in the Tokugawa bakufu] that [the Meiji Restoration] allowed the Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty to [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] reclaim its [the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] executive power over the Japanese government and [the Meiji Restoration] dissolved the Tokugawa shogunate and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the formation of the post-1868, pre-1947 the supposedly Shinto-pantheon descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled unitary Imperial parliamentary democratic Royal monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Third Japanese Empire/Great Japan/Imperial Japan/Empire of Japan ruling [the Great Japanese Empire] over [the Great Japanese Empire's territories] the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Russia's Sahalkin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands, Okinawa/Ryūkū, the Caroline's, the Marinas and Palau from [the Great Japanese Empire's homebase and stronghold] the Japanese Home Islands and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the rise of Japan as a political, military, economic and industrial superpower, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] does not lead to the displacement of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns and the samurai class due to the Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato regaining its power due to the Meiji Restoration as in OTL, but [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] is [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [what the Meiji Restoration is in this timeline] a compromise between the conservative feudal elites that support the Tokugawa clan and the bakufu system and the liberal democrats who support the imperial family in Tokugawa bakufu-ruled feudal Japan, with the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan maintaining their [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan's] positions as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan but [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] effectively only controlling Japanese local government in this timeline and [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan as sei-i taishōgun/shoguns of Japan after 1868 in this timeline] also leading the Japanese military into battle, with the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty in their [ the reigning heads of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's/Minamoto dynasty's] role as Japanese Emperors/Empresses being Japanese head of state and also the head of the Japanese armed forces. The buke/samurai and the daimyō are [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] not abolished [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] like in OTL but rather [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō in this timeline] into the Great Japanese Empire's post-1868, post-1947 hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [Magnificent/Exalted lineage |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The industrial, economic and military development that made Japan into a great power after the Meiji Restoration in OTL continues unhindered and the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, is [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] still [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] formed [the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces] in 3 January 1868 like in OTL, however the centuries-earlier victory of the Japanese in the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched [the Imjin Wars] by the hereditary military dictatorship of the Ashikaga bakufu de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in the entire Korean peninsula and the state it [Great Joeson] was [Great Joeson] a vassal [Great Joeson] to, the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" ruling over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, Yunnan and Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|] unlike in OTL and the subsequent annexation of post-Imjin Wars Korea into Ashikaga bakufu-ruled feudal Japan as the Japanese province of Chōsen with with Hideyoshi taking the last King of Joeson before the Imjin Wars in this timeline, Seonjo's daughter, Princess Jeongmyeong as his [Hideyoshi's] latest concubine after the Imjin Wars in this timeline and compliant members of Korea's indigenous slave-owning, sex-slave owning, China loving, resistant to change, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility, the yangaban, [compliant members of the yangaban] along with compliant members of the Korean royal family [the House of Jeonju Yi] being [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] married off [compliant members of the yangaban and the House of Jeonju Yi] into Japanese royalty, aristocracy and nobility after the Japanese victory in the Imjin Wars and the subsequent dissolution of Joeson and the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan as Chōsen in this timeline with buke/samurai and daimyō from the Japanese Home Islands slowly replacing the yangaban and the now-dissolved Joeson's ground force in this timeline, the now-dissolved Joeson Army as the main aristocratic and military presence within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea with anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi after its [post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea's in this timeline] annexation into Japan as Chōsen being [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi] hunted down and [ anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] either killed, reeducated or [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan] deported [anti-Japanese elements of the now-dissolved Joeson Army, the now-defunct Yangaban and the now defunct House of Jeonju Yi in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea] to the Ming dynasty by the Japanese, who [the Japanese] then [the Japanese in this timeline] after [the Japanese in this timeline] liberating the mostly illiterate, uneducated, impoverished and starving Korean people from the yangaban and the useless Korean royals [the House of Jeonju Yi] due to [the Japanese in this timeline] winning the Imjin Wars in this timeline, [the Japanese in this timeline] undertake a comprehensive education, primitive industrial and religious reform system in the post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korean peninsula, with schools being opened up for the common Korean people to get an education for themselves and their children and land reform in Korea being initiated by Hideyoshi by having seized yangban and House of Jeonju Yi estates go to ethnic Korean peasant farmers and ex-slaves within post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea in this timeline. The native Korean script for writing the Korean language, Hangul is [Hangul in this timeline] discovered [Hangul in this timeline] by the Japanese after the annexation of post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea into Japan and [Hangul in this timeline] subsequent spread and promoted as the way [Hangul in this timeline] to [Hangul in this timeline] write Korean by the Japanese in the timeline, who [the Japanese in this timeline] also promote the spread of the Japanese language and the heavily modified traditional Chinese characters used to write the Japanese language, Kanji, over the traditional Chinese characters used to write Korean utilized by the yangban and the House of Jeonju Yi, Hangul. The Japanese in this timeline also [the Japanese in this timeline] promote the Japanese indigenous national religion and state religion of Shinto, Zen Buddhism and even Christianity over traditional Korean shamanism, Taoism and Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea as well in this timeline, with the liberated Korean masses flocking to these new religions [ Shinto, Zen Buddhism and Christianity] in droves. The Japanese also [the Japanese in this timeline] begin a massive effort to [the Japanese in this timeline] absorb the Koreans into the Greater Japanese race and [the Japanese in this timeline] also integrate the Koreans into the Japanese political, social and economic systems, [the Japanese in this timeline] encouraging many Korean commoners in post-Imjin Wars, post-Joeson Korea to take Japanese names and let their children think of themselves as Japanese, speaking, writing and thinking in Japanese. This is hugely successful and the Koreans are [the Koreans in this timeline] eventually assimilated [the Koreans in this timeline] into the Japanese nation as the centuries go by, mostly thinking, speaking and writing in Japanese by the time of the alternate Meiji Restoration in this timeline, although a now heavily Japanese, Manchu/Manchurian and Chinese influenced Korean language still exists as a \\"dialect\\" of Japanese in this timeline, with Korea and the Koreans having roughly the same status as Okinawa and the Okinawans in both OTL Japan and this version of Japan in this timeline Hideyoshi also [Hideyoshi] conquers Russia's Sakhalin and [Russia's] Kuril Islands in this timeline after Imjin Wars in this timeline, which [Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in this timeline] become the Japanese province of Karufuto By the time Hideyoshi dies on September 18, 1598, with his [Hideyoshi's] nephew Toyotomi Hidetsugu succeeding him [Hideyoshi] as both Chief Advisor to the Japanese Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm and his [Hideyoshi's] young son Toyotomi Hideyori next in line to succeed both Hideyoshi and Hidetsugu as Chief Advisor to the Emperor and Chancellor of the Realm, with the then-reigning Japanese Emperor Go-Yōzei using this as an excuse not to appoint another shogun until Tokugawa Ieyasu attempts to take control of Japan from Hidetsugu and nearly reopens the Sengoku period. Go-Yōzei then appoints Ieyasu as shogun on March 24, 1603, causing the start of the Tokugawa shogunate and forces Ieyasu not to break the arranged marriage between Hideyori and Ieyasu's granddaughter Senhime, with the intention of making their [Hideyori's and Senhime's] first male child into the next shogun after Ieyasu's son Tokugawa Hidetada and also with the intention of uniting the Toyotomis and Tokugawas into a single family, securing the line of shogunal succession. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still [the Jurchens in this timeline] emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Japanese conquering the Tungning Kingdom in this timeline] on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Japanese also [the Japanese] work to assimilate the Chinese refugees from the Ming that make up the Tungning Kingdom's population and the main indigenous people in Taiwan who also make up 70% of Taiwan's population, the Han Chinese, or rather subgroup who speak Hokkien, a Southern Min language and/or trace their ancestry to southeastern Fujian in China, the Hoklo, [the Japanese working to assimilate the Hoklo] and the other indigenous tribes of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese population in this timeline using the same methods as used in Korea in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Returning to the alternate version of late 19th century to early 20th century Japan after the alternate version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces' ground warfare branch, the Imperial Japanese Army is [the Imperial Japanese Army] still [the Imperial Japanese Army] formed in February 1872 like in OTL but [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] is [the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline] significantly stronger than its [[the Imperial Japanese Army in this timeline's] OTL counterpart due to the earlier conquest and subsequent integration of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Korea and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands in Japan along with the discovery and exploitation of the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] by the Japanese The IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] is [the Kempeitai in this timeline] still [the Kempeitai in this timeline] formed on 4 January 1881 like in OTL The Cantonese Hakka-medical student turned Han nationalist, revolutionary, politician and statesman Dr. Sun Wen, [Wen] better known as Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is [Wen/Yat-Sen] assassinated [Wen/Yat-Sen] by a joint team of the UK's foreign intelligence M16 and the Russian Empire's combined secret police and foreign intelligence agency, the Okhrana when [Wen/Yat-Sen] studying in the Great Japanese Empire under the Japanese alias Kikori Nakayama [when Wen/Yat-Sen studied in the Japanese Empire under the name Nakayama] from 1899 to 1903. The mixture of steampunk and early diesel technology and sorcery known as Machinart [Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai], circuits [Machinart] made from spells that [the Machinart circuits] are [the Machinart circuits] put [the Machinart circuits] into objects [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] bring them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] to life and simultaneously [the placement of Machinart circuits into objects] give them [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence, [the development of the Machinart circuits] continues [the development of the Machinart circuits] in the United Kingdom in the early 20th century. These Automatons [the objects which the Machinart circuits are |the Machinart circuits| placed |the Machinart circuits| into] were [the Automatons] developed as a military weapon by the British government and spread throughout the world; the humans in charge of them [the Automations] became known as puppeteers. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution fought [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched and fought in the Xinhai Revolution] the anti Manchu Han nationalist and Cantonese nationalist revolutionary group adhering to republican, nationalist, and socialist objectives of the Tongmenghui which [the Tongmenghui] was [the Tongmenghui] founded by Wen/Yat Sen in 1905 in OTL which, [the Tongmenghui both in OTL and this timeline] later became the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society/revolutionary of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the Xinhai Revolution and the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] had [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people before and after the Xinhai Revolution, [the Kuomingtang, Tongmenghui and Yellow Sand Society launching the Xinhai Revolution] against the Manchu dominated, Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China from [the Great Qing Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Manchuria, whose [the Xinhai Revolution's] goal was [the goal of the Xinhai Revolution both in OTL and in this timeline] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\" in other words [Overthrow Qing and restore Ming] restoring the pre-1662, post-1368, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute dynastic Imperial Royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government [the Ming dynasty] of a post-Qing Han China, [the Xinhai Revolution fought to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming dynasty as the government of post-Qing Han China] still [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] happens despite Wen's/Yat Sen's earlier death due to the strength and influence of Han nationalism and Han monarchist groups in Qing-occupied Han China and the covert and open support Japan gives to the Tongmenghui both in OTL and in this timeline. Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China all [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] break away [ Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tuva, and Central China] from Manchuria like Han China during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. The post-1912, pre-1928 and then post-1937, pre-1945 the stratocratic [military dominated] Beiyang Government-ruled presidental parliamentary democratic republic of the First Republic of China is [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] still [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] formed [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] as the government [the Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China] of post-Qing, post-Xinhai Han China like in OTL while Manchuria still [Manchuria] comes [Manchuria] under the control of [which faction took over Manchuria] the Han Chinese bandit clique/military junta/Han Chinese government faction of the Fengtian Clique headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the Fengtian Clique's leader] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhang] known [Zhang] as [Zhang] \\"the Old Marshal\\", [Manchuria falling under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] despite the Qing Imperial Court continuing [the Qing Imperial court] still [the Qing Imperial court] existing in Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution like in OTL. When former top dog in the Great Qing Empire's modernized army corps envisioned as a regular and professional fully trained and equipped according to Western standards with a reserve, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang Government after the Xinhai Revolution and later the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China's first President, Yuan Shikai, [Shikai] still [Shikai] makes Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the unitary constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy of the Empire of China on 12 December 1915 like in OTL, everyone expects him [Shikai] to [Shikai] become Emperor [Shikai] of Han China. But unlike in OTL, he [Shikai] dies a day after [Shikai] forming the Empire of China in this timeline and so The Beiyang Government's armed wing and thus the first Republic of China's combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, [the Beiyang Army] built [the Beiyang Army] from both the Manchu and Han units of the now-dissolved New Army within Han China and the Beiyang Government's and thus the first Republic of China's and the Empire of China's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and House of Representatives, the National Assembly, [the Beiyang Army and the National Assembly] assume joint control over the Empire of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline, due to Yuan Shikai's eldest son, the half Korean Yuan Keding who [Keding] had [Keding] become Chinese Crown Prince under the combined era and regal name of Yuntai after Shikai formed the Empire of China, [Yuntai] refusing to become Emperor of China after Shikai's earlier death in this timeline. In order to stay afloat and not be toppled by the Chinese people like the Great Qing Empire, the Empire of China in this timeline decides to promote industrialization, development as well as the development of a National railway system in Han China along with [the Empire of China in this timeline] adopting a federalist, democratic system with the eighteen provinces of Han China proper being allowed autonomy, akin to the system of government in the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire and the USA. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China also sends many students to Japan for training, education and constitutional lessons, along with having the IJAF and the German Empire's unified ground and air force, the Imperial German Army both train and build up the Beiyang Army into a ultra-modern, developed, ready force. The Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline also reluctantly allows for the secession of Yunnan from Han China, which [Yunnan] subsequently restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government with support from the Japanese The joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China/Nationalist China based [Nationalist China] in [Nationalist China's] stronghold of [Nationalist China's stronghold and homebase] Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi |Cantonia|], [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] is [Nationalist China] still [Nationalist China] formed [Nationalist China] in this timeline due to the strong desire of the Cantonese people for independence from both Manchu and Han dominion and the large amount of Han nationalists and imperialists in the Cantonian population and [Nationalist China in this timeline] still [Nationalist China in this timeline] launches the Chinese Civil War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 known as the National Protection War against the Empire of China like in OTL, but [Nationalist China in this timeline] loses the National Protection War due to [why Nationalist China loses the National Protection War in this timeline] the massive corruption and incompetence in the Kuomingtang, the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army and the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan, along with the fact that most Cantonese don't want to be a part of China, whether Manchu or Han-dominated as well as Sun's/Yat-Sen's earlier death in this timeline denying Nationalist China the charismatic leadership it needs, An anti-Chinese unification, pro-Cantonese independence, pro-buisness, merchant-backed faction eventually grows strength in Nationalist China and launches a putsch that sees the take over of the Kuomingtang and the Legislative Yuan as the Beiyang Army decimates the NRA, leading to the leaders of the Kuomintang and the generals of the Beiyang Army agreeing to an armistice that sees the independence of Nationalist China and the abandonment of the territory of the Qing Empire by Nationalist China. British and French soldiers firing on Japanese soldiers helping the Beiyang Army against the NRA during the National Revolutionary War leads to the Japanese joining the Central Powers consisting of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [Japan joining the Central Powers in this timeline] in WW1 instead of the Central Powers' rivals consisting of the British Empire, the French supremacist, French imperialist, facist totalitarian dictatoral republic of the Third French Republic and the post-1861, pre-1947, French-Italian cadet branch of the German-Italian House of Savoy, the House of Savoy-Carignano ruled Unitary Constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy ruling over Italy, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritia and Somalialand, the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium ruling [the Russian Empire] over Siberia, the Baltics, the Caucuses, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Ukraine, Central Asia, Chechenya and Kalymkia from [the Russian Empire's homebase] European Russia, the Entente [Japan joining the Central Powers instead of the Entente like in OTL] with the IJAF destroying the Russian Asian fleet and [the IJAF] also providing support to liberation movements within the European colonies in Asia and Oceania, typing up European forces. The Japanese also seize control of the imperial Russian protectorate of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, Unitary Buddhist absolute monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State in Greater Mongolia and [the Japanese] use the Great Mongolian State to [the Japanese] assault Russian Siberia and Central Asia while the Imperial German Army assaults the Russian Empire from Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces, Austria-Hungary's combined land, sea and air combat forces [the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces] along with the combined armed forces of the Tsardom of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Imperial Armed Forces, clean up Russia's Serbian and Montenegrin puppets. The post-1842 army of the Ottoman Empire, after the country was reorganized along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period, the Modern Ottoman Army, eats out the flower of the Russian Empire's combined armed forces, divided into a standing army consisting of regular troops and two forces that served on separate regulations: the Cossack troops and the Muslim troops and a state militia, the Imperial Russian Army in the Caucuses and even along with the border with Iran. The Kempeitai also has former child refugee from the Confederate States during the American civil war turned failed professor and Confederate revisionist, Woodrow Wilson assassinated before he [Wilson] can [Wilson] become US President like in OTL and [Wilson in OTL] drag the USA into WW1. Without a charismatic figurehead [Wilson] to lead the movement to victory against the hated US Republicans, the American religious right, the civil rights movement and Germans in the USA, the American Democrat Party, more specifically its [the Democrat Party's] white nationalist, Anglophile, England worshipping, anti-Semitic, white supremacist, anti-German Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's armed wing, the KKK, [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] never launch the New Freedom Revolution of 1912 against the American government and the Republicans and [the Blue Dogs and the KKK] eventually fade from the political scene in the USA in this timeline, with some of them migrating to England or to British-controlled Canada. The Russian Empire is [the Russian Empire] forced [the Russian Empire] to [the Russian Empire] sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers. The terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk see the German Empire creating the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled absolute feudal royal monarchy of the United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the German Empire creating] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the German Empire] creating the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the restored German Empire creating] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled constitutional parliamentary royal imperial absolute monarchy of the Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire] forming the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the German Empire] restoring the hereditary royal absolute tribal Buddhist monarchy of the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and [the restored German Empire restoring] the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire also restores the constitutional parliamentary royal monarchy of the side branch of the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. The Ottomans liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Khongirad-ruled absolute hereditary Islamic royal imperial monarchy of the Khanate of Khiva in western Uzbekistan, southwestern Kazakhstan and much of Turkmenistan and [the Ottomans] also liberate the Sunni Muslim Imperial House of Manghud-ruled absolute imperial royal monarchy of the Emirate of Bukhara in eastern Uzbekistan, western Tajikistan, parts of southern Kazakhstan, parts of Turkmenistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. The Great Japanese Empire establishes the Japanese protectorate of the constitutional presidential parliamentary republic of the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. After the defeat of the Russians in the war, the Germans and Austria-Hungarians are able to focus all their efforts on the Western front. The demise of the Democrat Party in the USA leads to the US government launching a crackdown on pro-British groups and organizations and so the Allies are unable to get any help from the Americans, so the Imperial German Army, with help from the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces, [the Imperial German Army and the Austrian-Hungarian Armed Forces] march into the French capital of Paris, with the British being forced to surrender when the Labor Party of England storms Parliament with the help of the British people and forces the British government to an armistice with the Central Powers. The shock of being defeated by an hated enemy is simply too much for the British to bear and so loyalist elements of the British army and public forcefully transport the British government and the current British royal family [the British branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha] to the British colonial dominion of British North America ruling over Canada, [the forced transport of the British government and royal family to Canada after the British defeat in WW1 in this timelien] leading to the formation of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Afghanistan and India] and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire's homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands in this timeline. At this timeline's Treaty of Versailles presiding over the division of the defeated Western Entente's territories, signed [this timeline's version of the Treaty of Versalies] in the Austrian City of Linz in this timeline, the Labor-dominated British government recognizes the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as legitimate and the Entente as the initiators of WW1 and [the British] accepting German control of the German House of Wettin-ruled federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Belgium, which [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] takes the French region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais to [German-controlled Belgium in this timeline] form Greater Belgium. The Labor-dominated British government also recognizes the German annexation of Luxembourg and the loss of Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi to the Germans. The British also recognize the Albanian Muhammad Ali dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Egypt in Egypt's formal status as an Ottoman protectorate and also the independence of Sudan from the British and also the independence of all of Ireland as a unitary parliamentary royal monarchy under the rule of the Irish House of O'Neill Austria-Hungary also restores the pre-1903 Austrian protectorate of the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] removes the imperial Russian puppet fake Serbian royal family, the Serbian House of Karađorđević from power in post-WW1 Serbia. Austria-Hungary also demands that Serbia take full responsibility for starting WW1 by [Serbia] murdering Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Serbian nationalist terror organization that started WW1 by murdering the last pre-1903 King of Serbia and then Franz Ferdinand, the Black Hand be [the Black Hand] treated as war criminals. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia's combined armed forces, the Royal Serbian Army is [the Royal Serbian Army] placed under Austrian supervision. The Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Montenegro becomes an Austrian puppet state as well, with The Kingdom of Montenegro's combined armed forces, Royal Montenegrin Army under Austrian supervision. The German House of Wied-Neuwied-ruled Constitutional royal monarchy of the Principality of Albania in Albania takes Kosovo. Bulgaria subsequently receives the Moesia plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountains range (Stara Planina), Thrace from Greece and Macedonia from Serbia. The German House of Wittelsbach-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Greece becomes a Austrian puppet state as well. The Empire of China receives Singapore and Hong Kong from the British and Macau from the Portuguese. The Japanese also liberate the side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The Germans also take Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon from the French. The Germans also take the Congo from Belgium. The Germans combine Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin and Niger along with Chad, French Congo and Gabon in addition to Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi into one massive Central African German colony, Mittleafrika [Middle Africa |Mittleafrika|]. Austria also takes Veneto from the Kingdom of Italy. Thus the Treaty of Linz in this timeline ends with a decisive Central Powers victory and the end of British and French influence over the world. The Empire of China in this timeline remains under an extended regency for a year or two after the National Protection War due to Yuntai refusing the Chinese throne in this timeline, that is until the goal of the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline [\\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\"] is remembered and so the surviving descendants of the Chinese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] are [the Zhu descendants] invited [the Zhu descendants] by [who invites the Zhu descendants] the National Assembly under pressure of the Yellow Sand Society, [the Zhu descendants being invited by the National Assembly] to [what the National Assembly invites the Zhu descendants to do] reclaim their [the Zhu descendants'] rightful position as the rulers [the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China, which they [the Zhu descendants] reluctantly [the Zhu descendants] accept, [the Zhu descendants] seeing [the Zhu descendants] that the people of the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in Han China support them [the Zhu descendants] and the monarchy [the Ming dynasty]. Yuntai relinquishes his [Yuntai's] claim to the Chinese throne and [Yuntai] allows his [Yuntai's] children and [Yuntai's] siblings to be absorbed into the Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Han China after the National Protection war in this timeline is compared to this timeline's version of the Meiji Restoration in this timeline. The Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China ruling over Han China still has the official name of the \\"Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. A modified version of the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag becomes its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the Kuomintang's White Sun with a white-outer rayed, red inner-rayed yellow sun with the Chinese character for \\"Ming\\" in the middle of the yellow sun in tribute to the original Ming blue sky and red outer rayed yellow sun flag while the crossed 18-star iron blood flag of the Xinhai Revolution becomes the Chinese army flag. The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. The pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" era and the pre-Great Qing Empire, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility is [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] subsequently [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] restored, restructured, readjusted and modified for the modern world of the late 20th century, [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] being [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] merged [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] with the system of peerage Yuan Shikai had [Yuan Shikai] created when he [Yuan Shikai] formed the Empire of China in 1915. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] begins efforts to transition towards a constitutional parliamentary democratic federalist Imperial Royal monarchy with free and fair, democratic multiparty elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing and also to initiate massive industrial, railway and educational development works in Han China with the help of international aid. The Beiyang Army is [the Beiyang Army] retooled, restaffed and rebuilt into a modern incarnation of the Great Ming State's combined ground warfare and naval combat force, the Great Ming Army after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China with help from Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. Reformist elements of the Kuomingtang and the Nationalist Chinese government who had disagreed with Yat-Sen's goal of [Yat-Sen's] goal of Nationalist China' having the territory of the Great Qing Empire migrate to the restored Ming dynasty, including Sun-Yat-Sen's disciple and rightful heir, the Han Chinese revolutionary turned statesman and politician Wang Jingwei. Jingwei even becomes the Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet from 1939-1943, during which [Jingwei's first term as Prime Minister of the restored Ming dynasty] time the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the unitary parliamentary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] imperial dynastic monarchy of the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China, which [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] remains [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] the form [the Reorganized Government of the Empire of China] that the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] takes [the Beiyang Government-ruled restored Ming dynasty] from 1938-1954, and [Wang Jingwei becoming Prime Minister of the Ming Cabinet] again from 1945-1951. Before Jingwei, the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang still becomes the first Prime Minister of the Empire of China from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922, and Jingwei is [Jingwei] succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP in this timeline due to the Empire of China winning the National Protection War in this timeline, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members in this time, then Wu Shih-wen of the KMT from 20 May 2000 – 1 February 2002, Chiang Chung-ling of the KMT from March 2000 – 30 March 2003 , then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. These elements from Nationalist China and the Kuomingtang work to incorporate Yat-Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism/social welfare into the government of the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. After the Treaty of Linz in this timeline, France and the British Isles are stripped off all their power, influence and strength and subsequently become international pariahs. A revolution launched by socialist, communist and syndicalist groups against the fascist French regime in around 1918-1919 leads to the flight of the French fascists to French North Africa [French occupied Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia] and the subsequent joint invasion of the French mainland by the Imperial German Army and the Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. Mainland France soon falls quickly and the French House of Bourbon-ruled parliamentary constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of France is [the Kingdom of France] restored [the Kingdom of France] as the government [the Kingdom of France] of Northern France by Austria-Hungary while the Germans restore the Feudal royal parliamentary monarchy of the Dutchy of Brittany in Brittany and [the Germans] establish an independent Occitan kingdom in Southern France. A communist takeover of the British Isles minus Ireland leads to the invasion of the British Isles by Germany and Austria-Hungary and the division of the British Isles into their separate Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Scotland in Scotland ruled by the German House of Wittelsbach, the Kingdom of England in England ruled by the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Dutchy of Wales ruled by the Welsh House of Anwyl of Tywyn. The Central Powers and the Japanese also sent aid to the monarchist, Russian nationalist, Russian fascist Whites fighting against the Communist Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War with the Whites winning the Russian Civil War, unlike in OTL. Germany makes European Russia a German protectorate under the Romanovs while the Bolsheviks flee to Siberia. The Iranian Imperial House of Pahlavi/Pahlavi dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Imperial State of Iran is [the Imperial State of Iran] still formed in Iran in 1925, but Iran takes Dagestan from the restored Russian Empire, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Uzbekistan's and Turkmenistan's shared Khwarazm province, and [Iran] subsequently absorbs Afghanistan into itself [Afghanistan]. The Imperial State of Iran's combined land, sea and air combat forces, the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces receives training from the Germans and the Austria-Hungarians and become a modern, developed force. Due to WW1 ending with a Central Powers victory and fascism being contained to Italy and the Third French Republic in this timeline and communism being wiped out, national liberation movements never occur in Africa. The Central Powers and their satellite states surviving post-WW1 means that democracy is ironically more secure than OTL. The Brittanians use trickery and deceit to seize the former Confederate States of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina and integrate them [South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina] into British North America during a time of political chaos and instability in the USA, along with [the Brittanians] taking New England. This forces the Germans to make Texas into the Kingdom of Texas ruled by a side branch of the Hohenzollerns and the Japanese to seize the American West Coast, which [the American West Coast] becomes the Japanese protectorate of the Pacific States of America. The Japanese also seize Hawaii and [the Japanese] restore the Hawaiian House of Kawānanakoa-ruled semi-constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii in Hawaii. The influence of the Manchuria based division of the Great Japanese Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF's ground warfare division, the Imperial Japanese Army protecting the South Manchuria railway in Manchuria from Han Chinese bandits, the Kwangtung Army along with the IJA's military police that also shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within Japan and Japan's protectorates and Japanese occupied territories with the additional duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers of the IJA along with also issueing travel permits, recruiting labor, arresting resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spreading propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in Japanese occupied territories and Japanese protectorates, the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|] in Manchuria means that the Japanese are [the Japanese] able [the Japanese] to [the Japanese] push out Zhuolin and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria while [the Japanese] increasing the influence of the Qing Imperial Court and the indigenous Manchu nobility, aristocracy and royalty in Manchuria, [the Japanese decreasing the influence of the Fengtian Clique and increasing the influence of the Qing imperial court within post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] leading to it [post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria] becoming the pre-WW2 and WW2-era, post-1932, pre-1945 Imperial Japanese protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s, with the Great Qing Empire's last Emperor, Aisin-Gioro \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, [Pu-Yi] becoming [what Pu-Yi becomes after the formation of Manchukuo] the first Emperor [Pu-Yi after Manchukuo's formation] of Manchukuo like in OTL. After Pu-Yi's death in [when Pu-Yi dies in this timeline] around 1970, his [Pu-Yi's] younger half brother Aisin-Gioro Puren becomes [Puren in this timeline] the Emperor of Manchukuo, [Puren in this timeline] followed by his [Puren's] son, Aisin-Gioro Yuzhang after his [Yuzhang's] death in [when Puren died] 2015, who [Yuzhang] intends [Yuzhang] to [Yuzhang] make his [Yuzhang's] daughter, Jin Xin Empress of Manchukuo upon his [Yuzhang's] death. The Cantonese statesman, diplomat and calligrapher Zheng Xiaoxu is the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo like in OTL, followed by the Manchurian general, warlord and politician Zhang Jinghui like in OTL, followed by Hu Qili, then Jiang Zemin. The armed Wing and thus the combined armed forces of the Fengtian Clique formed from Zhuolin's bandit forces and what remained of the Manchu Bannermen and the Qing New Army in Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution, the National Pacification Army, [the National Pacification Army] becomes a modern, well equipped military force under the watchful eye of the Kwangtung Army with help from the Imperial German Army and Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces. The National Pacification Army eventually becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria becomes Manchukuo with Fengtian Clique and pro-China unification elements within the NPA being discredited, given extended sentences of leave to Nationalist China or the restored Ming dynasty, or otherwise removed in various ways. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after post-Xinhai, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria. Zhuolin's eldest son and his [Zhuolin's] heir to the leadership to the Beiyang Clique and thus of post-Xinhai Revolution, the pro-KMT, pro-Chinese unification, anti-Japanese Zhang Xueliang, [Xueliang] is [Xueliang] sent [Xueliang] to the restored Ming dynasty after Zhuolin's death via [Zhuolin's death] having his [Zhuolin's train] bombed, [Xueliang being sent to the restored Ming dynasty] in 1928. The New People's Society, a political organ [the New People's Society] that [the New People's Society] was [the New People's Society] designed [the New People's Society] to spread the Chinese government's [Reorganized Government of the Empire of China's] ideas to the Chinese public and [the New People's Society] mobilize economic and military support for the Chinese Reorganized Government and Japan, while [the new People's Society] training future civil servants, sending Chinese students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Han Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily with the core values emphasized were Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship, [the New People's Society] proves useful in getting the Chinese people to [the Chinese people] support the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and Japan, [the New People's Society] becoming the Han Chinese equivalent of the Concordia Association. When Yat-Sen's more famous student, the Cantonese revolutionary turned corrupt politician and then dictator who was Stalin’s puppet in China, Jiǎng Jièshí, who [Jièshí] was [Jièshí] better known as [Jièshí’s more famous alias] “Chiang Kai Shek”, [Jièshí/\\"Chiang\\"] [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí] attempts to [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek \\"in this timeline] seize control over both the KMT and Nationalist China and [Kai-Shek in this timeline] launch the 9 July 1926 – 29 December 1928 military campaign launched by the Kuomingtang's armed wing and thus the Nationalist Chinese combined armed forces, the National Revolutionary Army against both the Fengtian Clique and the Beiyang Government to reunify China, the Northern Expidition like in OTL, [Kai-Shek in this timeline attempting to seize control of Nationalist China and launch the Northern Expedition like in OTL] he [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] is [\\"Kai-Shek\\"/Jièshí in this timeline] instead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] shot dead [Jièshí/\\"Kai-Shek\\" in this timeline] by a disgruntled Cantonese citizen and the ruling pro-Cantonese independence, anti-Chinese unification faction dominating the Legislative Yuan, [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] retakes power after Kai-Shek's death and [the Legislative Yuan’s ruling pro-Cantonese independence faction] calls off the Northern Expedition. The Northern Expedition failing unlike in OTL allows Nationalist China, Manchukuo the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire to [Nationalist China, Manchukuo, the Beiyang Government and the Great Japanese Empire] survive post-1947 into the later half of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond. A short war between the Central Powers and the Canadian-based Brittanians, a Soviet rump republic and the North African-based Fourth French Republic in exile from around 1939-1947 which is this story's version of the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku] leads to the Japanese seizing Australia and New Zealand along with [the Japanese] participating in the liberation of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Burma from the British colonial occupation of the British Raj. Pakistan restores the Sunni Muslim Uzbek-Mongolian Imperial House of Babur-ruled Turko-Mongol khanate and Islamic sultanate of the Mughal Empire as its [Pakistan's] government after its [Pakistan's] liberation and [Pakistan] also takes Jannu and Kashmir. India proper becomes a federation of restored Muslim princely states, Muslim tribal duties and Muslim Kingdoms under the rule of the Uzbek Sunni Muslim Asaf Jahi dynasty ruling over Hyberdad. The Japanese also still liberate Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and East Timor from French and English colonial occupation but make Indochina into a federation of Muslim sultantes, tribal duties and local Kingdoms. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan in OTL, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] are [the JSDF] still formed in this timeline, but only as a defence force within the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units' respective cockpits in the respective units' prominent 'hump back', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass], [Brittania still developing the Knightmare Frames] in around 1955 like in canon Code Geass but Japanese spies steal the designs for the Knightmare Frames and mass produce their [the Japanese's] own, with German and Austria-Hungarian spies doing the same.

Raynare later [Raynare] decides to [Raynare] resume attending Majima as Yūma in order to [Raynare] get closer to Issei in this story while Mittelt in this story uses a fake human identity to [Mittelt in this story] attend Majima's middle school division in disguise while Kalawarna in this story becomes one of Majima's nurses. The excerpt should focus on Achika in this story as Miki giving birth to Issei as Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou watches, with Kiss-Shot observing in amusement disguised as a nurse. At the hospital room door, IJAF troops and JSDF troops stand guard along with Imperial German Army and Austria-Hungarian Armed Forces troops The 125th emperor of Japan with the same era and regal name, Heisei, and the current real-life head of the Tokugawa clan and thus the current shogun of Japan in this story, Tokugawa Iehiro, [Iehiro and Heisei in this story] both [Iehiro and Heisei in this story] pay a visit to the \\"commoner princess\\" [Miki as the Japanese Imperial Court knows her] and the \\"emperor who could never be\\" [Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou], with the then Emperor of Manchukuo Puren in this story along with the then Prime Minister of Manchukuo Zemin, the then Empire of China's Prime Minister Chiang Chung-ling, and the then Emperor of the Empire of Han China, Zhu Cǎiyī along with the then-Bogd Khan of the Great Mongolian State, the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, Jambalnamdolchoyjijantsan, and the current real-life head of the House of Hohenzollern and thus the then German Emperor in this excerpt, Georg Friedrich, along with the then real-life head of the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine and thus the then-Emperor of Austria-Hungary in this story, Otto von Habsburg, and the then-head of the House of Romanov and thus the then Russian Tsar in this story, Nicholas III also paying a visit, with the German Kaiser [Georg Friedrich] commenting to the Austria-Hungarian Kaiser [Otto] that Japan is the Asian combination of the UK and the Germanic states combined into one, it [Japan] has an Emperor acting as head of state and of the armed forces but a king [a shogun] to lead its [Japan's] forces into battle and a Prime Minister chosen from the winning party of the democratic elections to head the government. Otto then [Otto] reminds Georg Friedrich of the time when the German Empire in this story foolishly backed Kai-Shek because Kai-Shek had fooled the Germans into thinking he [Kai-Shek] wasn't influenced by the Soviets and that the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China would threaten German interests, only for the Empire of China to beat Nationalist China and [the Empire of China] restore the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu]. Manchukuo's Emperor Puren chuckles and comments that it was a good thing Kai-Shek failed [at unifying China] then, with Manchukuo's Prime Minister Zemin agreeing. Tsar Nicholas III of Russia just hopes that the then-Japanese royal princess' [Achika in this story as Miki's] then being born son [Issei as Achika in this story as Miki gives birth to him] won't assault Russia any further, with the then-Bogd Khan of the Great Mongolian State Jambalnamdolchoyjijantsan reminding him [Tsar Nicholas III of Russia] that Russia occupied large parts of Asia before WW1. Achika in this story as Miki finishes giving birth to Issei and Emperor Heisei of Japan along with Shogun Iehiro of Japan rush in along with the German Kaiser [Georg Friedrich] commenting to the Austria-Hungarian Kaiser [Otto] and the Chinese Emperor [Cǎiyī] only to see a mysterious woman [Kiss-Shot] besides a tired Achika in this story as Miki, [Kiss-Shot] petting Issei's kitsune ears and [Kiss-Shot] feeling Issei's soft, fluffy kitsune tails as she [Kiss-Shot] states he [newborn Issei] is [newborn Issei] destined for greatness and that she [Kiss-Shot] will [Kiss-Shot] lead and guide him [Kiss-Shot] to his [Issei's] destiny. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","completion":"In the hospital room bathed in soft, artificial light, Nobuyuki—as Gorou—stands at Miki's side, his hand gripping hers firmly. Despite his unfathomable experiences across timelines and identities, the birth of his son carves a unique epitome of anxiety and excitement within him, emotions raw and genuine. Miki, even in exhaustion, maintains an admirable demeanor, her deep breaths syncing with the rhythmic beeps of the heart monitor. As a final, decisive push echoes softly, a new cry pierces the tranquility—an affirmation of life that has successfully embarked on its journey. \\"Congratulations,\\" the attending physician announces with a warm smile, carefully wrapping the newborn in a soft blanket before handing him to his mother. \\"You have a healthy baby boy.\\" Nobuyuki watches, a mix of pride and wonder painting his features, as Miki cradles the baby close. His gaze, however, momentarily shifts to a nurse standing unobtrusively at the corner, her identity known only to him as Kiss-Shot, her presence a testament to the intertwining fates and the concealed magical underpinnings of their world. At the doorway, an unusual congregation forms—a spectacle of eras and empires represented through their leaders. Their discussions hover around politics and past conflicts, but all fall silent as Kiss-Shot's voice, resonant yet soothing, fills the room. \\"He bears the marks of future greatness,\\" she states mysteriously, her eyes never leaving the infant, who quiets down as if in recognition of her words. \\"His journey will be pivotal, not just for Japan, but for the balance of our world. I shall ensure his guidance.\\" Outside, the gathered dignitaries exchange looks of intrigue and apprehension. The alliances and rivalries, the shared histories of their nations now seem to converge on this singular point in time, represented by the birth of this child. Emperor Heisei steps forward, his expression solemn yet hopeful. \\"May this new life herald a new era of peace and understanding amongst us,\\" he declares, his voice resonating with the weight of centuries of leadership. Shogun Iehiro nods in agreement, his thoughts on the future path of Japan and its place in the geopolitical tapestry. Kaiser Georg Friedrich, intrigued by the mention of the child's destined greatness, leans in, his curiosity piqued. \\"A child of prophecy, then? Our nations have seen the turmoil of war and the blossoming of peace. Let us ensure his legacy is one of unity and strength.\\" Otto von Habsburg adds, his tone reflective, \\"Indeed, our pasts are interwoven with victories and losses. May his story weave a future where the past's mistakes are lessons, not repetitions.\\" As discussions quietly swirl about destinies and legacies, Nobuyuki remains fixed on Miki and their son, Issei. The weight of Kiss-Shot's words does not escape him; he knows too well the intertwining of fate and free will. Yet, in this moment, as he observes his son—ears and tails unnoticed by the others, save for Kiss-Shot—he embraces a simple, incontrovertible truth: beyond prophecies and magic, here lies his family. And in the sanctuary of this hospital room, amidst a convergence of historical powerhouses, it's the silent vow he makes to guide and protect Issei—not just towards greatness, but towards happiness—that rings the most profound."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Крестьяне с серпами будут слабыми в бою, но могут служить как пушечное мясо. Лучники и рейнджеры с копейщиками и мечниками образуют основу армии, обеспечивая гибкость в ближнем бою. Копейщики, особенно ветераны, могут быть эффективны против кавалерии. Мечники и мастера меча предлагают высокую боевую мощь в ближнем бою. Кавалерия, включая всадников, чемпионов и паладинов, является ударной силой армии, крестоносцы же представляют собой элиту с высокими боевыми способностями. Тактика этой армии будет заключаться в использовании крестьян как первой линии для поглощения удара, затем включения стрелков и копейщиков для удержания врага на расстоянии, в то время как кавалерия и элитные юниты могут прорывать уязвимые места и наносить решающие удары. **Армия 2:** Армия 2 является более уникальной и фантазийной, состоящей из разнообразных существ с различными способностями. Полурослики с пращами представляют собой слабую дальнобойную поддержку. Боровы могут быть сильными в ближнем бою благодаря своим клыкам. Железные и стальные големы представляют собой тяжелую бронированную ударную силу, практически неуязвимую для обычного оружия. Птицы рух имеют воздушное превосходство, что может быть использовано для нападения с воздуха. Маги и архимаги добавляют эффективность сил армии за счет использования магии, что может быть критическим преимуществом. Гиганты и титаны являются разрушительной силой благодаря метательной молнии, представляя серьёзную угрозу даже для самых защищённых противников. Тактика этой армии будет заключаться в использовании магических и тяжелых юнитов для прорыва и уничтожения ключевых элементов вражеской армии, при этом воздушные и легкобронированные юниты будут обеспечивать поддержку и гибкость на поле боя. **Вывод:** Учитывая силу и разнообразие армии 2, в частности, за счет наличия магических способностей, высокой бронированности големов и воздушного преимущества, скорее всего, именно этой армии будет проще адаптироваться к различным тактическим ситуациям и противостоять угрозам, которые предлагает армия 1. К тому же, особое внимание следует обратить на эффективность магических атак против традиционно вооруженных сил, что может служить решающим фактором. Таким образом, **армия 2** имеет более высокие шансы на победу, учитывая ее состав и способности."},{"prompt":"请用html、js、python等构建一个类anki的web","completion":"制作一个类似Anki的Web应用涉及前端界面设计、后端数据处理等多个方面。以下是一个简化版的示例，利用HTML用于结构搭建，JavaScript实现前端逻辑，而Python（Flask框架）用于后端服务搭建。 # 第一步：环境准备 确保你的机器上安装了Python及必要的库（Flask）。若未安装，可以通过以下命令安装Flask： \`\`\`bash pip install flask \`\`\` # 第二步：后端设置（Python/Flask） 创建一个基本的Flask服务器\`app.py\`： \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, jsonify, request, render_template app = Flask(__name__) # 模拟数据库 cards = [ {\\"id\\": 1, \\"front\\": \\"Apple\\", \\"back\\": \\"苹果\\"}, {\\"id\\": 2, \\"front\\": \\"Banana\\", \\"back\\": \\"香蕉\\"} ] @app.route('/') def home(): return render_template('index.html') @app.route('/api/cards') def get_cards(): return jsonify(cards) # 为简化，这里不实现添加和修改卡片的API if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) \`\`\` # 第三步：前端设计（HTML & JavaScript） 在Python项目的根目录下创建一个名为\`templates\`的文件夹，然后在该文件夹内创建\`index.html\`文件： \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Mini Anki</title> </head> <body> <h1>学习卡片</h1> <div id=\\"cards\\"></div> <script> // 使用fetch API从Flask后端获取卡片数据 function getCards() { fetch('/api/cards') .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { const cardsElement = document.getElementById('cards'); cardsElement.innerHTML = ''; // 清空卡片内容 data.forEach(card => { const cardElement = document.createElement('div'); cardElement.innerHTML = \`<p><strong>{card.front}:</strong> {card.back}</p>\`; cardsElement.appendChild(cardElement); }); }); } // 加载页面时获取卡片数据 window.onload = function() { getCards(); } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` # 第四步：运行应用 1. 在命令行中运行\`app.py\`以启动Flask服务器： \`\`\`bash python app.py \`\`\` 2. 打开浏览器并访问\`http://127.0.0.1:5000/\`，你将看到一个简单的学习卡片应用。 # 补充说明 这个示例非常基础，并没有实现完整的Anki功能，比如卡片的添加、修改、记忆算法等。但是，它为你搭建一个类似Anki的Web应用提供了一个起点。你可以在此基础上继续开发，增加数据库支持（如使用Flask-SQLAlchemy），添加用户认证，以及实现更复杂的记忆算法等。"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:G},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},P=["disabled"],q={key:0},R={key:1};function j(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
