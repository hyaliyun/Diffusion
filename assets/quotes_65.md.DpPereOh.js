Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood, near East 85th Street and Quincy Avenue, to Naomi Womack and Friendly Womack, Bobby was the third of five brothers. Friendly Jr. and Curtis were the older brothers, Harry and Cecil were his younger brothers. They all grew up in the Cleveland slums, so poor that the family would fish pig snouts out of the local supermarket's trash. He had to share a bed with his brothers. Circa 1965, Womack relocated to Memphis where he worked at Chips Moman's American Studios. He played guitar on recordings by Joe Tex and the Box Tops. Womack played guitar on several of Aretha Franklin's albums, including Lady Soul, but not on the hit song \\"Chain of Fools\\", as erroneously reported. His work as a songwriter caught the eye of music executives after Wilson Pickett took a liking to some of Womack's songs and insisted on recording them. Among the songs were \\"I'm a Midnight Mover\\" and \\"I'm in Love\\". In 1968, Bobby signed with Minit Records and recorded his first solo album, Fly Me to the Moon, where he scored his first major hit with a cover of The Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\". In 1969, Womack forged a partnership with Gabor Szabo and with Szabo, penned the instrumental \\"Breezin'\\", later a hit for George Benson. Womack also worked with rock musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Janis Joplin, contributing vocals and guitar work on the Family Stone's accomplished album There's a Riot Goin' On, and penning the ballad \\"Trust Me\\", for Joplin on her album Pearl. In fact, Womack was one of the last people to see Joplin alive, having visited her hours before she died at the Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles, California. After two more albums with Minit, Bobby switched labels, signing with United Artists where he changed his attire and his musical direction with the album Communication. The album bolstered his first top 40 hit, \\"That's the Way I Feel About Cha\\", which peaked at number two R&B and number twenty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1972. Did this receive any awards or set any records?","completion":"The article doesn't mention any specific awards or records that were set.

However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements. Understanding how pain works in the mind and brain could eventually give doctors tools for helping people cope with painful medical treatments. Question: How did the volunteers learn to expect different levels of heat? Yes or no, is the answer \\"From the length of the pause between a tone and the heat pulse.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the volunteers learned to expect different levels of heat from the length of the pause between a tone and the heat pulse. During training, the longer the silent pause after the tone, the stronger the heat pulse would be, and this would cause more severe pain. As a result, the volunteers learned to associate the pause's length with the upcoming heat pulse's intensity."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. jan made a deal with a assassin so she considered the arrangements in detail. Given the context: Why did Jan do this? Possible answers: teach her bully a lesson, make someone's life better, hire a killer","completion":"Based on the information provided, it's not definitively clear why Jan made a deal with an assassin - each of the suggested motivations could be plausible depending on additional details. However, a careful analysis of each motive can allow us to understand possible reasons that may have driven Jan's decision. Firstly, let's consider the possibility that Jan made arrangements with an assassin in retaliation against a bully. Perhaps Jan was the victim of continuous and severe bullying, and she possibly felt threatened, helpless or desperate to end this harassment. Maybe she has tried other means like petitions or legal routes that have proven unsuccessful, or perhaps she lives in a context or society where such protections are not available or effective. In such alternatives, one might understand how Jan could be driven to such drastic measures as to involve an assassin as a form of retribution against her bully. Secondly, Jan could have made a deal with the assassin to make someone's life better. Assuming Jan has noble intentions, this 'someone' might be haunted by a dangerous character, kept under inhumane conditions or mistreatment, threatened, or potentially harmed due to a person who Jan seeks to eliminate. The significant factor here would be Jan's perception that traditional routes of aid (law enforcement, diplomacy, legal recourses, and so on) are unavailable, ineffective, biased, corrupt, or too slow. Thirdly, the assertion that Jan wanted to hire a killer can imply many reasons. Perhaps she wishes to climb the echelons of power in a criminal organization, has a personal vendetta against someone, needs to remove someone for financial gain or perhaps she seeks protection. It's a possibility that Jan exists in a world where moral boundaries blur, law enforcement is corrupt or non-existent, one's survival equates to the power they exert, or maybe it's personal vengeance or fear. It should be noted that taking such a course as hiring an assassin has severe ethical and legal implications. Yet, in all these speculated scenarios, Jan chooses this path for some perceived protective, retributory, or potentially self-serving purpose. Underlying all those possibilities is a critical factor: Jan sees this decision as her best or only option given her circumstances. Unfortunately, without more extensive detail about Jan's backstory, her emotional state, the surrounding circumstances, and her intrinsic motivations, we can only make conjectures at this point. However, the presented scenarios provide some potential insight into the diverse reasons Jan might have for making such a grave and significant decision."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Death is actually murder by peanut allergy Senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because Senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said 'no' to mean mulit millionaire. Everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi (ex-girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie, disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience, Senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son, he gives money freely to lots of broke students). All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is 'at that age' and has a crush on a boy, who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty, but only to dump him because the 'in' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him. Don't worry, she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the 'in' girls drop her, Aunty also explains that God is the only one who truly she can rely on (I was almost sick at this point).

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter.

The enthusiasm which greeted the Diamond Jubilee was, of course, especially memorable for me and my family. It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago. People of all ages took the trouble to take part in various ways and in many nations. But perhaps most striking of all was to witness the strength of fellowship and friendship among those who had gathered together on these occasions. On the barges and the bridges and the banks of the river there were people who had taken their places to cheer through the mist, undaunted by the rain. That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing over the elements. That same spirit was also in evidence from the moment the Olympic flame arrived on these shores. The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service. As London hosted a splendid summer of sport, all those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes. In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama. We were reminded, too, that the success of these great festivals depended to an enormous degree upon the dedication and effort of an army of volunteers. Those public-spirited people came forward in the great tradition of all those who devote themselves to keeping others safe, supported and comforted. For many, Christmas is also a time for coming together. But for others, service will come first.

In National Security/Emergency Preparedness telecommunications services, \\"\\"provisioning\\"\\" equates to \\"\\"initiation\\"\\" and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), originally the International Telegraph Union, is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies. - The electromagnetic spectrum is the collective term for all known frequencies and their linked wavelengths of the known photons (electromagnetic radiation). The \\"electromagnetic spectrum\\" \\"of an object\\" has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object. - A wireless network is any type of computer network that uses wireless data connections for connecting network nodes - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a data link. The connections between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet. - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are extremely widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication. To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. Now, I have a new situation: Eric is driving on a highway. His exit is coming up soon so he let's up on the gas a little and makes a left turn onto the exit.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Options: A A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Ivor Parry Evans ( February 20 , 1923 , ( Aliquippa , Pennsylvania ) -- October 24 , 2009 ( Abilene , Texas ) was a United States Air Force officer and commander . - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.

After the birth of their twin daughters, Annie and Hallie (Lindsay Lohan), Nick and Elizabeth divorce and lose contact, each parent raising one of the twins without telling her about her sister. Nick raises Hallie in Napa Valley and becomes a wealthy wine grower, while Elizabeth raises Annie in London and becomes a famous wedding gown designer.Over 11 years later, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally enroll their daughters at the same all-girls summer camp in Maine called Camp Walden. Hallie and Annie first meet at the end of a fencing match, when they remove their masks and see that they look exactly alike. A comical hostility between the two girls leads to a prank war that ends when the camp counselors fall into one of Hallie's traps and isolate the twins from the other girls.Living together in an isolation cabin, Hallie and Annie discover they were born on the same day, and each has half of a torn wedding photograph of their parents. Realizing with delight they are twins, the girls act a plan to meet their previously unknown parents. Each girl trains the other to impersonate her, with the intent to switch places at the end of summer camp.When camp is over, the twins put their plan into action. Hallie, pretending to be Annie, goes to London to meet her mother, her maternal grandfather, Charles, and the James family's butler, Martin (Simon Kunz). Annie, pretending to be Hallie, goes to California to meet her father, the Parker family's housekeeper, Chessy (Lisa Ann Walter), their dog Sammy, and Nick's young, opportunistic fiancée, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), who is only interested in Nick's money. Distressed by Meredith's deviousness, Annie telephones Hallie and persuades her to bring Elizabeth to California to break up the engagement.

Please answer the following question: Two friends met after 20 years and had a beer together. Vlad was a geologist and studied earthquakes. Mort was a pedologist and studied soils. They had some interesting conversations that night. Which friend studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials? Hint: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Mort, the pedologist, studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials. Vlad, as a geologist, specialized in studying earthquakes and had direct involvement with seismic waves. Geologists analyze seismic waves to understand Earth's interior, allowing them to develop insights into the composition and structure of the Earth. Seismic waves also play a crucial role in determining the movement of energy radiating from an earthquake's focus. These waves travel at differing speeds through various materials and may change speeds upon encountering new materials. Some seismic waves are unable to travel through liquids or gases and come to a halt. In contrast, Mort's field of study is pedology, which is concerned with the study of soils. Pedologists analyze the formation, distribution, and classification of soils in the natural environment. While soils may be affected by seismic waves and other geological phenomena, pedologists primarily focus on the properties, management, and utilization of soils rather than on seismic waves and their various characteristics. Therefore, the friend who studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials is Mort, the pedologist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I was about 14 and lived near a large tract of undeveloped land where people would go and park to fool around. There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness.

The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter Ric Ocasek; singer, songwriter and bassist Benjamin Orr; lead guitarist Elliot Easton; keyboardist Greg Hawkes; and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: \\"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends--punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop--and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\\" In 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, Millbrook, New York on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, \\"Blue Tip\\", on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album. In October Billboard reported that a new album which may be supported by a tour is being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of a new song, called \\"Sad Song\\", was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called \\"Free\\" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for \\"Blue Tip\\" was released February 17, 2011. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band, and NYC based street artist Joe Iurato. According to Rolling Stone, the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts. The new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboard's album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. The album's first single, \\"Sad Song\\", was released to radio stations March 1.

Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's first analyze the information given: 1. Case A: John pointed his telescope at planet Mars. 2. Case B: John pointed his telescope at a faraway planet called WASP-17b. 3. Case C: John pointed his telescope at planet Jupiter, which is farther from the Sun than Mars is. Now we need to determine which case would see faster movement, case A or case C. Since the question is related to the movement speed of the planets, we should consider the planets' orbital speed around the Sun. Step 1: Identify the orbital speeds of Mars and Jupiter. Mars has an average orbital speed of approximately 24.077 kilometers per second, while Jupiter's average orbital speed is about 13.07 kilometers per second. Step 2: Compare the orbital speeds of Mars and Jupiter. Based on the information above, Mars has a faster orbital speed than Jupiter, with the difference being about 11.007 kilometers per second. Step 3: Determine which case sees faster movement. Since Mars has a faster orbital speed than Jupiter, case A, where John points his telescope at Mars, would see faster movement.

In 1982, McKagan became the drummer for the hardcore punk band The Fartz, with whom he recorded several demos, five of which were included on their 1990 album You, We See You Crawling. After several line-up changes, The Fartz evolved into the post-punk band 10 Minute Warning, for which McKagan played guitar. In 1983, McKagan moved to Los Angeles, California, with one of his brothers where he found work as an appetizer server at a Black Angus restaurant in Northridge. Answering an ad for a bass guitarist in a local newspaper, he met guitarist Slash and drummer Steven Adler, with whom he formed the short-lived band Road Crew. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what would become the Guns N' Roses song \\"Rocket Queen\\".

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the specific suite of rooms that briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King Edward VIII? ? Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Sir Charles Allom, created a more \\"binding\\" Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the piano nobile of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle. It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir Charles Long.

Answer:","completion":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer's dissatisfaction and frustration with the film are evident through various aspects of their review. They express strong negative sentiments, emphasizing their disappointment in multiple ways. First, the title of the review itself, \\"So bad,\\" instantly communicates the reviewer's unfavorable opinion of the film. It establishes the negative tone and sets the stage for the rest of the critique. Next, the use of \\"A minus score\\" highlights the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the rating system, implying that even the lowest possible score wouldn't be low enough to accurately represent their disdain for the film. They go as far as suggesting Amazon should allow users to assign zero ratings, further emphasizing their utmost disappointment. Moreover, the statement \\"I will pay you to take this film out of my house\\" provides a hyperbolic depiction of the reviewer's regret in having this film in their possession. It suggests that they would rather incur additional expenses than have the film in their home anymore. The reviewer also makes it clear that they found no value in the film, asserting that it was not \\"funny or redeeming in any way.\\" This is a sweeping and comprehensive statement that allows no room for potential benefits or enjoyable moments. Lastly, the overall brevity and strong language used in the review indicate a firm belief in the opinion presented. The author does not provide specific details regarding the film's content, nor do they offer any counterpoints or mitigating factors. This might make the review seem less nuanced, but it does effectively communicate the passionate, unflattering perspective of the reviewer.

Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

After, the Teutonic knights constructed the fortress of Koporie, where they kept all their supplies, and took the Novgorod city of Tesov, pillaging its merchants and ravaging the surrounding area. The Novgorodians, fearing a fate similar to that of Pskov, sent envoys to Prince Yaroslav. Yaroslav liked Alexander's younger brother Andrew as a leader, but Novgorod insisted on Alexander. Alexander returned to Novgorod and commanded its army to Koporye in 1241. In the Spring of 1242, he recaptured Pskov. After this victory, Alexander decided to continue his campaign.. On April 5, 1242, one of Russia's most famous battles, the Battle of the Ice, took place on the ice of Lake Peipsi. The battle was a significant defeat sustained by the crusaders during the Northern Crusades.

Translate to English","completion":"In May, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to force the government to release information about its electronic surveillance activities. The American Civil Liberties Union, widely known as the ACLU, is an organization committed to the defense and preservation of individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the US Constitution and the laws of the United States. In this context, their lawsuit against the Department of Justice represents an effort to promote transparency and accountability within the US government, specifically in regards to its actions related to electronic surveillance. The debate surrounding electronic surveillance has grown increasingly contentious in recent years, particularly due to concerns over the invasion of privacy and the undermining of civil liberties. The ACLU's lawsuit aims to shed light on the government's use of invasive surveillance tools and practices, which have the potential to compromise the privacy rights of American citizens. The Department of Justice is a federal executive department responsible for enforcing federal law and administering justice in the United States. As part of its law enforcement and national security mandate, the DOJ possesses surveillance capabilities that may be utilized in the investigation of potential threats or crimes. However, these capabilities have also sparked concerns over the potential abuse of power and infringement on constitutional rights. By taking legal action against the DOJ, the ACLU is attempting to hold the government accountable for its use of electronic surveillance and to ensure that these practices do not infringe upon the rights of US citizens. This lawsuit is intended to promote transparency by compelling the government to release data about its surveillance activities and to raise public awareness about potential abuses of power. In conclusion, the ACLU's decision to sue the US Department of Justice in May demonstrates the organization's commitment to advocating for transparency and accountability within the government, specifically concerning matters related to electronic surveillance. The lawsuit ultimately seeks to ensure that the government's use of surveillance tools and practices does not infringe upon the constitutional rights of American citizens and to foster a broader public understanding of this critical issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You may think that sailing is a difficult sport, but it is really not hard to learn it. You do not need to be strong. But you need to be quick. And you need to understand a few basic rules about the wind. First, you must ask yourself, \\"Where is the wind coming from? Is it coming from ahead or behind or from the side?\\" You must think about this all the time on the boat. The wind direction tells you what to do with the sail. Let's start with the wind blowing from the behind. This means the wind and the boat are going in the same direction. Then you must always keep the sail outside the boat. It should be at a 90deg angle to the boat. Then it will catch the wind best. If the wind is blowing from the side, it is blowing across the boat. In this case, you must keep the sail half way outside the boat. It should be at a 45deg angle to the boat. _ needs to be out far enough to catch the wind, but it shouldn't flap . It shouldn't look like on a flagpole. If it is flapping, it is probably out too far, and the boat will slow down. Sailing into the wind is not possible.

As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Paragraph: Scientists are performing an audio experiment on a volunteer. Chris is sat in a chair, and two different sounds will be played for him as the scientists observe his reactions. Sound X has a high decibel level and sound Y has a lower decibel level. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sound is less likely to make Chris lose hearing? A:","completion":"Given the information provided in the background and paragraph, Sound Y, which has a lower decibel level, is less likely to make Chris lose his hearing compared to Sound X, which has a higher decibel level. As mentioned, high-decibel sounds are dangerous and can cause damage to the ears and hearing loss. Since the intensity of sound increases with every 10-decibel level, and loudness becomes 10 times greater, it becomes clear that the higher the decibel level, the more potential damage it can cause to an individual's hearing. Therefore, in the given scenario, Sound Y's lower decibel level implies less intensity and less potential for causing harm to Chris's hearing than the higher decibel level of Sound X. It is worth noting, however, that other factors such as duration of exposure to the sounds and individual sensitivity can also contribute to hearing damage, but based solely on the decibel levels, Sound Y is less likely to cause hearing loss for Chris."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Blood can be kept in the fridge for about three weeks with a kind of chemical. When people lose much of their blood because of operations or accidents, they may need transfusions . Some people may need transfusions because of illness. Sometimes only a part of the blood is used for transfusions. Plasma , the liquid part of the blood , may be given alone.

In this statement, the speaker addresses the president and expresses that their group finds only two aspects particularly important in regards to the Stockholm Program. The Stockholm Program is a strategic framework created by the European Union, aiming to address issues related to justice and home affairs, such as immigration and asylum policies, as well as legal cooperation between member states. The first aspect that the group appreciates about the Stockholm Program is its focus on promoting a common European asylum system. This aspect is important because it aims to harmonize procedures and standards among EU member states, ensuring that all asylum seekers receive fair and equal treatment without any bias or discrimination. By implementing a common asylum system, the European Union can provide better assistance and protection to those fleeing from war, persecution, and humanitarian crises. The second aspect the group deems significant is the emphasis on the protection of individual rights and privacy. The Stockholm Program places a strong emphasis on respecting fundamental rights and freedoms, highlighting the importance of protecting citizens' personal data and privacy. In the era of rapid technological advancements and increasing surveillance, safeguarding individuals' rights, including their right to privacy, has become a crucial concern. The fact that the Stockholm Program acknowledges these issues and seeks to address them is highly valued by the group. In conclusion, the two aspects that the group appreciates most about the Stockholm Program are its commitment to establishing a common European asylum system and its dedication to protecting individual rights and privacy. These factors hold great significance because they contribute to creating a more just, equal, and secure environment for all European citizens and those who seek refuge within the European Union's borders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They formed in 1968, consisting of singers Russell Thompkins Jr., Herb Murrell, Airrion Love, James Smith, and James Dunn. All of their US hits were ballads characterized by the falsetto of Russell Thompkins Jr. and the production of Thom Bell. During the early 1970s, the group had twelve consecutive R&B top ten hits, including \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\", \\" After signing to Avco, the record label approached producer Thom Bell, who had already produced a catalogue of hits for The Delfonics, to work with the group. The Stylistics auditioned for Bell, but he was initially unimpressed. He ultimately agreed to produce the group because he believed in the potential of lead singer, Russell Thompkins, Jr.'s distinctive, nasal high tenor & falsetto voice. Avco gave Bell complete creative control over the Stylistics and he proceeded to focus the group's sound exclusively around Thompkins's voice. On most of the group hits, Bell would have Thompkins sing virtually solo. The first song recorded with Bell and his collaborator, lyricist Linda Creed, was the lush \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\". Bell imported techniques he had perfected with The Delfonics and his musical arrangements worked perfectly with Thompkins' falsetto vocals. Their hits from this period --distilled from three albums-- included \\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\" (U.S. #3), \\"I'm Stone in Love with You\\", \\"Break Up to Make Up\\" (U.S. #5), \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" featuring Thompkins singing a rare lead vocal duet with Airrion Love, the aforementioned \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\", \\"You Are Everything\\", and the Top 20 Pop hit \\"Rockin' Roll Baby\\" (U.S. #14). \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" was the group's biggest U.S. hit, holding at No. 2 for two weeks just as the spring of 1974 turned to summer, and was one of the group's five U.S. gold singles. The Stylistics' smooth sound also found an easier path on to adult contemporary airwaves than many other soul artists and the group made Billboard magazine's Easy Listening singles chart twelve times from 1971 to 1976, with three entries (\\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\", \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\", and \\"You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)\\") reaching the Top 10.

As Quaid encounters Melina, he is captivated by her charm, and a strange connection develops between them. Melina manages to escape, but a mission to eliminate her remains in Quaid's hands. Meanwhile, Melina is planning a full-scale attack on MCB and plans to expose their manipulation of people's minds by showing evidence and broadcasting it to the public. As an illusionist, Melina creates holographic projections to carry out her mission and get the truth out in the open. In their second encounter, Melina confronts Quaid and reveals that they were once lovers. Quaid initially refuses to believe her, but she projects a hologram that shows their past memories together, slowly making him question his loyalty to MCB.

Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion. - The Crab Pulsar ( PSR B0531 +21 ) is a relatively young neutron star . The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula , a remnant of the supernova SN 1054 , which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054 . Discovered in 1968 , the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically . The optical pulsar is roughly 20 km in diameter and the pulsar \`\` beams '' rotate once every 33 milliseconds , or 30 times each second . The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission , which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula , seen from radio waves through to gamma rays . The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar 's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula , forming a termination shock . The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly , with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp - like features that steepen , brighten , then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula . The period of the pulsar 's rotation is slowing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind . The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy . It is very bright in X-rays and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant , with the exception of the pulsar itself . The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors . In X-ray astronomy , ' crab ' and ' millicrab ' are sometimes used as units of flux density . A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10 11 erg s 1 cm 2 ( 2.4x10 14 W m 2 ) in the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray band , for a \`\` crab - like '' X-ray spectrum , which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy , I ( E ) = 9.5 E 1.1 . Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness . - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

(KTLA) — A husband who accidentally sold his wife’s wedding ring at a garage sale was hoping the person who bought it would bring it back. Racquel Cloutier hid her 22,000 wedding ring under a cushion in a wooden watch box for safe keeping before she went into the hospital to deliver her fifth child. While Cloutier was in the hospital, her husband, Eric, sold the box at a neighborhood garage sale for 10. “We never use it so I said let’s make somebody happy. I looked in it, I didn’t see anything and I sold it,” Eric Cloutier said. Racquel Cloutier is offering a reward for the return of her wedding ring. “It’s my wedding ring and its a one of a kind,” Cloutier said. “It’s such a bad feeling whenever you lose something, especially when it means so much to you.” The woman who bought the box was described as middle-aged with shoulder length blond hair and glasses. “We’re hoping maybe she can see this on TV and maybe realize and look in the box and hopefully she’ll be honest enough and bring it back,” Eric Cloutier said. The family can be contacted by email at racquelcloutier@gmail.com. The ring can also be dropped off anonymously at the security gate of the San Joaquin Hills community, located at 27380 Aliso Niguel Road. ||||| Poker player Eric Cloutier made headlines this week for accidentally selling his wife’s wedding ring — reportedly valued at 23,000 — for just 10 at a neighborhood garage sale.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pope Accepts Resignation of Bishop Who Didn't Report Abuse (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) — Pope Francis accepted the resignation Tuesday of a U.S. bishop who was convicted of failing to report a suspected child abuser, answering calls by victims to take action against bishops who cover up for pedophile priests. Bishop Robert Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St Joseph in Missouri for nearly 10 years, resigned under canon law that allows bishops to resign early for illness or some “grave” reason that makes them unfit for office. But his resignation did not provide a specific reason. Finn, 62, is 13 years shy of the normal retirement age of 75. In 2012, Finn was found guilty of one misdemeanor count of failure to report suspected abuse and was sentenced to two years of probation, making him the highest-ranking church official in the U.S. to be convicted of not taking action in response to abuse allegations. Prosecutors say the diocese did not notify police until six months after concerns were raised in 2011 about the Rev. Shawn Ratigan, whose computers were found to contain hundreds of lewd photos of young girls. Since the convictions, Finn has faced pressure to resign, including local and national petition drives asking the pope to remove him from the diocese. The removal was praised by Marie Collins, a prominent member of Francis’ own sex abuse advisory board who had called for Finn to go and demanded that the Vatican hold bishops accountable when they fail to protect children. “Things are moving slowly, as I have said many times, but they are moving in the right direction!” Collins tweeted. Francis appointed Archbishop Joseph Naumann, head of the Kansas City, Kansas, diocese, to lead the Missouri diocese until Finn’s successor is named. In a letter to the diocese, Naumann said he prayed “that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing.” Naumann will retain his duties in Kansas. Finn, who apologized for Ratigan’s abuse and took measures to make the diocese safer for children, urged followers to pray for his successor. Sister Jeanne Christensen, a member of the Sisters of Mercy who has been a critic of Finn, said “it’s sad that it took so long.” “We have suffered a lot under him, and justice has finally been done,” Christensen said. “Let’s just wish him well. And now we need to get moving on to healing the diocese.” For Kansas City resident Andrew Miller, 23, a lifelong member of Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, Finn’s resignation will make attending Mass easier. After Finn’s conviction in 2012, he said, he would say, “I’m a Catholic, but_.” Now, “I’m ready to call myself a Catholic again.” “Why would I put money in a collection plate to pay for lawyers to defend sex offenders?” he said, adding that next time he attends Mass, he might contribute “in celebration of a new bishop.” Rebecca Randles, the attorney who represented the plaintiffs in several abuse lawsuits that have cost the dioceses millions of dollars, said Finn’s resignation was an important step for abuse victims and the diocese. “For survivors, there is a sense that as long as Finn was in charge, there would be no way they would have had closure on their own experience. He was a symbol bearer,” she said. “And this kind of abuse ripples across all the Catholic faithful.” One of Finn’s strongest advocates, Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said Tuesday that Finn had been a target of elements of the Catholic church who did not like the bishop’s strict adherence to Catholic teachings. “He’s a good man,” Donohue said. “No one called his office and complained specifically that their child was being abused. If he didn’t give a damn, he could have ignored it completely and told everyone in his office to ignore it. He didn’t. He called the authorities. The way he’s been treated is simply not fair.” No U.S. bishop has been forcibly removed for covering up for guilty clergy. Technically speaking, Finn was not removed — he offered to resign, in the same way that Boston’s Cardinal Bernard Law did in 2002 after the clergy sex abuse scandal exploded in his archdiocese. Law had not been convicted of a crime, as Finn was, and the failure of the Vatican to remove Finn for three years after his conviction fueled victims’ complaints that bishops were continuing to enjoy protections even under Francis’ “zero tolerance” pledge. In a statement, Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the online abuse resource BishopAccountability.org, said Finn’s resignation was a welcome step but called on Francis to publicly state that he was removed for mismanaging the Ratigan case and failing to protect children. She noted that bishops had been allowed to resign under the previous two popes, but that the Vatican has never publicly linked their resignations to mishandling abuse cases. “We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately. That would be unprecedented,” she said. “And it would send a bracing message to bishops and religious superiors worldwide that a new era has begun.” Winfield reported from Vatican City. Associated Press writer Hannah Cushman in Chicago contributed to this report. Correction: The original version of this story, using information from the Associated Press, incorrectly described the outcome of Bishop Robert Finn’s case. He was convicted of failing to report abuse.

Using a truck modified as a battering ram, the group break into a security depot in London and steal a large amount of money before the police arrive. However, they discover they barely got the amount of money they wanted, and only £68,000 to each man. Julian demands an extra amount of money as \\"expenses\\" for his work, but is beaten and placed in the boot of Ray's car until he just accepts his share. The group, without Julian, later spend time at a bar with fellow criminal Sonny, and Ray's girlfriend Connie, a protester. Ray and Stevie also visit an elderly couple, Linda and Bill, where they leave their stolen money for safekeeping. The next day, Ray and Stevie, who live together with Connie, are alerted by a bruised Dave that his money was stolen, apparently by Julian. Ray, Dave and Stevie investigate Linda and Bill's home to find them murdered and the money stolen, leaving Ray emotionally distraught. He visits Julian but his money is missing too. They conclude that Sonny stole the money and break into his house, only to find Jason dead with a headwound.

Summarize: The 116m (Â£74m) deal is a big step by Penguin Books into the rapidly expanding self-publishing industry. Penguin said the deal gave it a leading position in a sector that has entered the mainstream in the past three years. But some have criticised the buy-out, with one authors' body saying it could threaten the rights of new writers. The growth of e-book readers and tablet computers has prompted a change in the route taken by authors, with increasing numbers choosing to bypass traditional publishers and release and market their own titles. Some 150,000 writers have published their work through ASI since it was established in 2007. In 2011, 211,000 titles were self-published in either print or digital form - an increase of almost 60 percent on the previous year. EL James' erotic novel, Fifty Shades of Grey, which became the first book to sell more than one million copies on Amazon's Kindle e-reading device, began as a self-published title. Penguin chief executive, John Makinson, said that buying Author Solutions \\"will allow Penguin to participate fully in perhaps the fastest-growing area of the publishing economy and gain skills in customer acquisition and data analytics that will be vital to our future\\". But Deputy General Secretary of The Society of Authors, Kate Pool, said the deal is \\"misleading\\" to budding writers. \\"Companies like those in the ASI stable claim to be self-publishing but are not,\\" she claimed. \\"The author pays for certain services but in return the work is generally produced only as print-on-demand and the author is obliged to give the company exclusive rights, and will be paid only a royalty. \\"Our concern is that ASI companies are very misleading to aspiring authors. They are not self-publishing, nor are they proper publishers - though the apparent endorsement of the Penguin/Pearson brand may lead some authors to think they are,\\" she added. Philip Jones, deputy editor of The Bookseller said it is \\"absolutely right\\" that Penguin is tapping into the self publishing market. \\"This is where writers are,\\" he said, adding \\"they have recognised a gap in the market in indie publishing. \\"They are not buying a franchise, they are buying an infrastructure company. There's nothing retrograde about this decision to buy [ASI].\\" With access to an additional 1,600 members of staff, Penguin's takeover of ASI will provide it with the additional resources to forge ahead with plans to digitize its back catalogue of 16,000 titles within two years. Mick Rooney from The Independent Publishing Magazine said he has \\"no doubt\\" there will more deals like the one between Pearson and ASI. \\"Publishing - and what it once meant and how it's executed - is changing in process, as well as the myriad of developing e-markets. \\"I'd say the difference now is that the responsibility is squarely on the shoulders of the author to ensure money flows to the author through the decisions he or she takes,\\" he said. \\"Traditional publishing and self-publishing are both risks - the personal and financial value is learning how to wager those risks sensibly,\\" he added. ASI's chief executive Kevin Weiss said the company was \\"thrilled to join Penguin to accelerate the pace of change in the industry\\". ASI has 1,600 employees based in the US and Philippines, and generated revenues of about 100 million in 2011. Penguin said ASI would be integrated into Penguin's back office, but would continue to run as a separate business. Summary:","completion":"Penguin Books has made a significant move into the self-publishing industry with a 116m acquisition of Author Solutions (ASI). The deal is expected to give Penguin a leading position in this growing sector, which has gained mainstream traction over the past three years, fueled by the rise of e-book readers and tablets. The partnership will also equip Penguin with crucial skills in customer acquisition and data analytics for the future. However, some have criticized the acquisition, arguing that it could threaten the rights of new writers and be misleading to aspiring authors. Despite this, Penguin's takeover of ASI will provide additional resources for the company as it aims to digitize its back catalogue and stay competitive in the changing publishing landscape."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Question: What else besides technology which cools is meant for food freshness? Context: Since the Industrial Revolution some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include pasteurisation, autoclavation, drying, salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.","completion":"Besides technology that cools, there are various other methods designed to maintain the freshness of food. These technologies have also been designed to extend the lifespan of food to prevent it from spoiling. For instance, pasteurization and autoclavation, both heating techniques, are used extensively in the industry. Pasteurization involves heating food to a specific temperature to kill harmful pathogens, while autoclavation involves using high pressure and heat to sterilize food. Both technologies ensure food safety and prevent bacterial infections. Additional methods of preserving food freshness involve drying and salting. Drying is a method where water is removed from the food to inhibit the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Salting, on the other hand, helps preservation by drawing water out of the food to prevent bacterial growth. Lastly, the separation of various components of food is another technique to maintain food freshness. This involves breaking down the food product into its individual parts to able to preserve and manage each piece individually. While these technologies have proven to be effective methods to maintain food freshness and increase food safety, it should be noted that they also come with certain downsides and may alter the original nutritional contents of the food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Canada produced its electricity by using fossil fuels and nuclear fission. New Zealand used only alternative, renewable sources to produce their electricity. But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. What is an answer for this question: Which country burned less coal? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, New Zealand burned less coal than Canada in producing electricity. This is because New Zealand used only alternative, renewable energy sources, while Canada relied on a combination of fossil fuels, including coal, and nuclear fission for its electricity production. The environmental impact of electricity production from coal and other fossil fuels is significant. When fossil fuels are burned, they release air pollutants, contributing to air pollution, which can negatively affect human health, cause acid rain, and accelerate global warming due to the release of greenhouse gases. The use of renewable energy sources, on the other hand, significantly reduces these negative environmental impacts, as they don't emit harmful pollutants in the process of generating electricity. In the United States, the majority of electricity production is still heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels, highlighting the need for a transition towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower have the advantage of providing a clean and sustainable means of electricity production without the environmental repercussions associated with fossil fuels. The benefits of nuclear energy as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels are clear, in that it does not release air pollution or contribute to global warming. However, it is important to note that nuclear energy still relies on nonrenewable resources, as radioactive elements can eventually be depleted. Moreover, the disposal of nuclear waste and concerns surrounding nuclear accidents remain key challenges in the widespread adoption of nuclear energy. In conclusion, New Zealand burned less coal than Canada, due to its exclusive use of renewable energy sources for electricity production, highlighting their commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy generation. Meanwhile, Canada and the United States still rely heavily on fossil fuels, including coal, for much of their electricity production, with the associated negative environmental impacts. A global shift towards the use of renewable energy sources can help in mitigating these environmental concerns and facilitating a sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Choppers, trucks douse stricken nuke plant By Hayden Cooper, staff Updated Japan is making a last-ditch attempt to cool stricken reactors at its Fukushima nuclear plant, but efforts so far appear to have had little effect. Special military fire trucks unleashed jets of water on a damaged reactor at the quake-hit plant on Thursday, after police were earlier forced to withdraw their own water cannon from the scene due to high levels of radiation. While police must be outside to use their vehicle, the military vehicles are built to allow personnel to remain inside. As well as water-spraying trucks, four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters from the Japan Self-Defence Forces flew water bombing missions over the plant, emptying tonnes of water onto reactors which have been overheating since being damaged by last Friday's earthquake and tsunami. But there are serious doubts the water drops will have any major effect, with the amount of water each chopper drops a fraction of what is needed to fill the pool. The focus of the missions appeared to be the No.3 reactor but there have been reports that only two out of the four water drops actually hit their mark, and the missions appeared to have little impact on the radiation levels. Part of the reason why the water drops have not been that accurate is that they were not allowed to fly too low because of the radiation levels. Defence minister Toshimi Kitazawa said an additional 11 military vehicles would be deployed for efforts to help cool the reactors, while pumps supplied by the US armed forces were also being transferred. On Friday, water drops will start above the No.2 reactor, which has been letting off white smoke or steam. Tokyo has denied claims that the spent fuel rods in the No. 4 reactor are totally exposed, with cabinet spokesman Yukio Edano saying there is still water inside. The plant's operators are desperately trying to restore electricity supply so the cooling system can restart. \\"We cannot tell when, but we want to restore the power source as soon as possible,\\" a spokesman for the plant's operators TEPCO told AFP. Japan's foreign ministry spokesman Hidenobu Sobashima says the government is making every possible effort to contain the damage. \\"We are not in a position to comment on whether the concern is unwarranted, but we understand the concern,\\" he said. \\"The government is giving the advice which the government considers appropriate. We hope the international community monitors the situation in a calm manner, as the prime minister appealed to the residents and the people of Japan, to act calmly.\\" As the fight for control of the reactors continued, Japan instructed local authorities to start screening food for radioactivity. Australians have been told to leave the capital and other areas affected by the ongoing crisis. The Department of Foreign Affairs has now widened its recommended exclusion zone for Australians around the Fukushima plant to 80 kilometres. Japanese authorities had ordered people within 30 kilometres of the plant to evacuate or stay indoors. This afternoon the Federal Government said the number of Australians unaccounted for in Japan had fallen to 20. Call for volunteers The Japanese government's nuclear safety agency has said the top priority should be pouring water into the fuel-rod pools at reactors three and four, which may be boiling and are not fully covered by roofs that would reduce radiation leaks. Employees of TEPCO and other industry firms have volunteered to join efforts to control the escalating crisis, local media said. TEPCO put out a call for about 20 volunteers to join the battle to bring the situation under control at the Fukushima No.1 plant, where last week's quake and tsunami knocked out the reactor cooling systems, Jiji Press reported. Offers came in from TEPCO employees and others, including a 59-year-old man with four decades of experience working at nuclear power stations for a regional power company who was due to retire in six months, the report said. Officials at TEPCO were not immediately available to confirm the reports. TEPCO was preparing to restore outside power lines from Tohoku Electric Power Co., which serves the region, and connect its damaged electric transmission system with unaffected lines. \\"At the moment, we are concentrating our efforts on this work,\\" he said. \\"If the restoration work is completed, we will be able to activate various electric pumps and pour water into reactors and pools for spent nuclear fuel.\\" The 9.0-magnitude quake, the biggest on record to strike Japan, knocked down electricity pylons which Tohoku had used to supply power to the TEPCO plant. Some 70 workers have been using pumps to pour seawater to cool reactors at the plant, according to media reports, using electricity from borrowed mobile generators. -ABC/wires First posted ||||| Nuclear safety officials in France said they were \\"pessimistic\\" about whether engineers could prevent a meltdown at the Fukushima power plant after a pool containing spent fuel rods overheated and boiled dry. Last night radiation levels were \\"extremely high\\" in the stricken building, which was breached by an earlier explosion, meaning that radiation could now escape into the atmosphere. Tokyo Electric, the owners of the plant, said five workers had been killed at the site, two were missing and 21 had been injured. Last night, a US nuclear safety chief said the Japanese government had failed to acknowledge the full seriousness of the situation at the Fukushima plant and that warnings to citizens had been insufficient and understated. Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, warned that if \\"extremely high\\" radiation levels increased it would become impossible for workers to continue to take corrective measures at the plant as \\"the doses they could experience would potentially be lethal doses in a very short period of time\\". As Japan resorted to increasingly desperate measures – including dumping water on the site from helicopters – there were accusations that the situation was now \\"out of control\\". The Foreign Office responded to the latest developments by advising all British citizens to leave Tokyo – which is 140 miles south of the plant – and the whole of northern Japan. The EU has even urged member states to check Japanese food imports for radioactivity. Emperor Akihito made a rare address to the nation, urging the Japanese to pull together, but hinted at his own fears for the nuclear crisis saying: \\"I hope things will not get worse.\\" In London, the FTSE–100 share index slumped as news of the latest emergency emerged, closing 1.7 per cent down. The official death toll from last Friday's earthquake and tsunami stood at 4,314 last night, with another 8,606 listed as missing. Thousands of people still waiting for food aid in the most remote areas of the disaster zone endured fresh misery yesterday as heavy snow began to fall across northern Japan. But all eyes were on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant as Japanese authorities admitted concerns over rising temperatures in three pools containing spent fuel rods. A failure of the cooling system that has crippled the entire plant led to water boiling in the No4 pool. Last night the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) said there was no water left in the pool, resulting in \\"extremely high\\" radiation levels. An earlier fire and explosion in the No 4 reactor building is thought to have breached the protective walls around the pool. A statement from the USNRC said: \\"We believe that secondary containment has been destroyed and there is no water in the spent fuel pool and we believe that radiation levels are extremely high which could possibly impact the ability to take corrective measures.\\" If the water has gone, Mr Jaczko warned, there is nothing to stop the fuel rods from getting hotter and ultimately melting down. The outer shell of the rods could also ignite with enough force to propel the radioactive fuel inside over a wide area. Jeremy Browne, the Foreign Office minister, said: \\"There is clearly an evolving situation and things are clearly getting worse at the Fukushima nuclear plant.\\" Attempts to cool the site by dumping sea water from helicopters had to be aborted at one stage because of dangerous radiation levels in the air above the plant. A police water cannon was brought in to help blast water into the overheating reactors and pools, but there were warnings that it may be too late to prevent a disaster. Thierry Charles, a safety official at France's Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), said: \\"The next 48 hours will be decisive. I am pessimistic because, since Sunday, I have seen that almost none of the solutions has worked.\\" He described the situation as \\"a major risk\\", but added: \\"All is not lost.\\" Asked about the maximum possible amount of radioactive release, he said \\"it would be in the same range as Chernobyl\\". The incident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine on April 26 1986 is estimated to have caused 57 direct deaths, with some 4,000 additional deaths from cancer. Francois Baroin, a French government spokesman, went further, saying: \\"In the worst of cases, it could have an impact worse than Chernobyl.\\" He added: \\"They have visibly lost the essential of control.\\" Malcolm Grimston, a British nuclear expert at the Chatham House think tank, played down suggestions of an impending disaster, saying Fukushima was not like Chernobyl. \\"We're nearly five days after the fission process was stopped, the levels of radioactive iodine will only be about two–thirds of where they were at the start, some of the other, very short–lived, very radioactive material will be gone altogether by now,\\" he said. Earlier, Nathalie Kosciusko–Morizet, France's ecology minister, had said that \\"the worst scenario is possible and even probable\\". At one point, radiation levels at the plant rose to such dangerous levels that all workers were evacuated from the site. A 180–strong team was later allowed back to continue attempts to cool the fuel rods, but the government raised the maximum allowable radiation exposure for workers from 100 millisieverts per year to 250, which it said was \\"unavoidable due to the circumstances\\". Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency's director general, said the situation was \\"very serious\\". He is flying to Japan today for a first–hand briefing on the crisis. ||||| U.S. officials are alarmed at how the Japanese are handling the escalating nuclear reactor crisis and fear that if they do not get control of the plants within the next 24 to 48 hours they could have a situation that will be \\"deadly for decades.\\" \\"It would be hard to describe how alarming this is right now,\\" one U.S. official told ABC News. President Obama has been briefed by nuclear experts. The Japanese have evacuated most of the reactor personnel from the Fukushima nuclear complex and are rotating teams of 50 workers through the facility in an attempt to cool it down. \\"We are all-out urging the Japanese to get more people back in there to do emergency operation there, that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical,\\" the official said. \\"Urgent efforts are needed on the part of the Japanese to restore emergency operations to cool\\" down the reactors' rods before they trigger a meltdown. \\"They need to stop pulling out people—and step up with getting them back in the reactor to cool it. There is a recognition this is a suicide mission,\\" the official said. The official said the United States is in very deep consultations with Japanese about the way forward and that the only thing that has been favorable is the wind pattern that is blowing the contaminated material out to sea instead south towards Tokyo and other populated areas, but that can't be counted upon. The U.S. official says experts believe there is a rupture in two, maybe three of the six reactors at the Fukushima power plant, but as worrisome is the fact that spent fuel rods are now exposed to the air, which means that substances like cesium, which have a long half-life, could become airborne. \\"That could be deadly for decades,\\" the official said. There is a growing concern around the world that a nuclear catastrophic disaster is in the works. \\"There is talk of an apocalypse and I think the word is particularly well chosen,\\" European Union's energy commissioner Günther Oettinger said today, according to various reports. \\"Practically everything is out of control. I cannot exclude the worst in the hours and days to come.\\" The United States has instituted a 50-mile evacuation zone for U.S. forces and American citizens from the Fukushima power plant, four times the size of Japan's 12-mile evacuation zone. Only exceptions that are made are for relief missions. \\"Recently the NRC made a recommendation that based on the available information that we have, that for a comparable situation in the United States, we would recommend an evacuation to a much larger radius than has currently been provided in Japan,\\" Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Greg Jaczko said at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee. Jaczko said of the four plants that are endangered at the Fukushima site, there has been a hydrogen explosion at one unit and secondary containment has been destroyed. \\"We believe radiation levels are extremely high, which could possibly impact ability to take corrective measures,\\" he said. U.S. analysis show that some of the radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power plant has drifted northward and out to sea, officials say, but the country is hardly clear of danger. U.S. Fears Japan's Crisis Could Be Worse Than Chernobyl Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Narita Airport today amid rising concerns of a radioactive fallout. The head of the U.S. Department of Energy said today that the nuclear disaster unfolding in Japan could be worse than the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania that dampened Americans' view of nuclear power plants for decades to come. \\"Events unfolding in the Japan incidents appear to be more serious than Three Mile Island. To what extent, we don't know that. They are unfolding hour by hour,\\" Energy Secretary Steven Chu said earlier today at the hearing. Chu's assessment is in line with views expressed by many experts, some of whom even believe the Japan crisis could be worse than the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine that left hundreds sick and killed several from radiation. The United States has deployed thousands of military and civilian staff to assist the Japanese in dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake and the resulting tsunami, which has killed thousands. To date there have been 113 helicopter missions and 125 fixed wing missions. More than 129,000 pounds of water and 4,200 pounds of food have been delivered . The Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission has sent teams of U.S. experts to assess the nuclear situation. U.S. aid to Japan has reached nearly 5.9 million, with total planned assistance amounting to 8 million. USAID says the primary humanitarian needs on the ground remain food, safe drinking water, blankets, medical supplies, fuel, and sanitation infrastructure. ABC News' Huma Khan and Luis Martinez contributed to this report. ||||| Japan's nuclear crisis now hangs largely on whether it can get control over the radioactive waste held in pools of water at the troubled Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Workers have struggled to cool the used nuclear-fuel rods held in these pools, in an urgent fight to prevent a release of significant quantities of radiation into the environment. On Thursday morning, helicopters from the Self Defense Forces, Japan's version of the military, began dumping water over the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex, according to government broadcaster NHK. Spent Fuel at Risk View Interactive All through the Fukushima plant, efforts are focused on keeping cool water over nuclear fuel rods in reactor cores and in pools where spent fuel is stored. More photos and interactive graphics On Wednesday, Scott Burnell, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said, \\"We now understand that conditions for the spent fuel pool in Reactor 4 are very serious.\\" He added that \\"our understanding is the conditions have deteriorated.\\" The waste—used fuel rods from the six reactors—continues to be highly radioactive even when it is no longer useful for generating electricity and is removed from the reactor core. To prevent the used fuel rods from heating up, sustaining damage, and then releasing radiation, they must be continually cooled by water for many years. The Fukushima complex has seven pools serving six reactors. On Wednesday, officials acknowledged they faced serious cooling problems with at least four of the pools. So far, at least two pools have lost enough water to expose fuel rods to the air, allowing them to overheat and release hydrogen gas. The gas is a product of the breakdown of zirconium cladding that encases fuel rods. Nuclear physicist James Acton and WSJ's Lee Hotz discuss whether Japan can avoid nuclear disaster as workers scramble to cool the overheating spent fuel at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. The rods, known as spent fuel, are stored on an upper floor adjacent to, and at the same height as, the reactor. That keeps the distance the fuel rods must be moved to a minimum and was supposed to protect them from tsunamis. However—unlike the reactor core, which is surrounded by a strong steel vessel—the only shielding between the radioactive waste and the outside air is concrete. Increased heating and consequent damage to the fuel rods could mean \\"that there's a clear pathway for the release of radionuclides,\\" or radioactive materials, said Edward Lyman, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. As the water in the pool heats up and evaporates, the vapor carries some radioactive elements, including tritium gas. Worse, if the water level drops and exposes the spent fuel, those rods can suffer the same type of damage—a partial or full meltdown—that can occur to a reactor core. \\"If the temperature continues to increase, you reach a point where the fuel pellets can melt,\\" Dr. Lyman said. As a result, \\"a lot of fission products will start to bubble out.\\" Smoke rising from the plant's No. 3 reactor indicates that a pool where spent fuel rods are stored within the building had dried out, a spokesman for utility operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said. The water from the helicopters was aimed at this pool. Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes there could be a crack in the spent fuel pool, increasing the risk that water drains from the pool and leads to overheating. The pool at unit 4 is especially worrying. Its fuel rods were removed from the reactor core in December 2010, and therefore contain a high level of radioactivity and are generating more heat than used fuel rods stored elsewhere at the Fukushima site. The spent fuel pool at that unit has lost all or most of its water and radiation levels \\"are extremely high,\\" Mr. Jaczko said. It is unclear what the condition is of the seventh and largest pool that holds approximately 65% of used fuel rods from the six reactors, but they are likely the oldest and coolest.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1988 in Huntington Beach, California and currently recording for Rude Records/Bird Attack Records. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP. In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file. Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released Gorgeous, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro. Who replaced Rapp after he left the band?","completion":"After Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp left Guttermouth in 1999, the band went through a lineup change. Derek Nunn, who was originally the drummer, moved to play bass to replace Rapp. Subsequently, a new drummer named William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in to fill the vacant drummer position."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

REAGAN'S FIGHT - VARIED ENEMIES ON MANY FRONTS - News An alysis - NYTimes.com WASHINGTON, Sept. 16— In proposing only marginal cuts in military spending and further major cuts in domestic spending, President Reagan has decided to remain faithful to his central campaign pledges and has taken the biggest gamble of his young Administration. Instead of husbanding his power, as he did so successfully over the first eight months, he now has to take on several major fights at once, with conservatives and liberals alike, over a fistful of foreign and domestic issues. By all Administration accounts, Mr. Reagan still deeply believes that his economic policy will work, despite increasing doubts even in his own team, and that substantial increases in military strength are the core of a successful foreign policy, despite warnings by allied leaders that diplomatic avenues are being neglected. They Say He Won't Bargain Much Most of these same officials say that their chief will stick to his positions and is unlikely to bargain much, behaving as he did in the air traffic controllers strike. As these officials explain it, Mr. Reagan has made his budget decisions in such an unbending and public way that they think he has deliberately circumscribed his own flexibility, trying to give members of his own party no choice but to back him and making the stakes very high for the Democrats who oppose him. As Administration officials see the situation, the list of possible combatants has grown: Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Bank over high interest rates; Congress over another slash into politically important domestic programs; Congressional supporters of Israel who seek to block the sale of the advanced Awacs radar aircraft to Saudi Arabia; and yet another Congressional coalition if Mr. Reagan decides, as expected, to go forward with the MX missile system. Thought One Was Behind Him As described by several midlevel political appointees in the Administration, Mr. Reagan did not expect two months ago to have to fight on all fronts at once. Then, it looked as if the battle over the economy was behind him and that he could concentrate on national security issues. The White House timetable was to make the decision on how to base the new multibillion-dollar MX missile late in July or early in August, dealing with the critics before the summer was over, and then move to counter Congressional opposition to the Awacs sale in September and October. But the MX decision began to drag. First, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger wanted to scrap entirely the Carter Administration's idea of shuttling 200 MX missiles among 4,600 shelters and launch the missiles instead from aircraft. When this idea got knocked down, Mr. Weinberger proposed a scaled-down version of the Carter plan. Even now, Mr. Reagan has not made a final decision. The shifting of proposals and the delays have led to questions from Congress and diplomatic circles whether the Reagan Administration will have much confidence in its own decisions. This is even more the case because as the summer wore on, money and the economy began to reassert themselves as issues. The 30 billion to 50 billion needed to build the MX system, and the 1.5 trillion for the military, over all, in the next five years, looked like inviting targets for budget cuts as interest rates remained high and the economy slowed. Wall Street Turns on Plan Wall Street analysts, without warning and contrary to the line mostof them took only a few months earlier, began to turn against the Reagan econom ic plan on the ground that it was not bringing interest rates down. T he Congressional Budget Office and some of Mr. Reagan's own economist s began predicting much higher budget deficits than expected in t he current fiscal year and foresaw no balanced budget, as Mr. Reagan had promised, for the fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1984. To make matters worse, Mr. Weinberger and David A. Stockman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, carried the argument about where to make cuts into the public arena. White House aides expressed unhappiness over this byplay because it was putting Mr. Reagan in the corner: If he backed Mr. Weinberger, the economic plan would collapse; and if he backed Mr. Stockman, national security would be undermined. As the betting on compromise spread, as it seemed that Mr. Reagan would take about half of the needed 75 billion in additional budget cuts for 1983 and 1984 from the Pentagon, he decided instead to limit the Pentagon's cuts to 12 billion over the three years. Return Request Termed Damaging A number of Congressional and Administration economists are now saying that even a 75 billion reduction would not be sufficient to balance the budget in 1984. If this reduction is insufficient and Mr. Reagan has to return to Congress in six months and ask for more, Administration officials feel it could destroy the confidence that Mr. Reagan has said is essential to the success of his economic plan. By the same token, if Mr. Reagan fails to weather votes of disapproval in the House and Senate on the Awacs sale, Pentagon and State Department officials say this would eliminate an essential ingredient of the ''strategic consensus'' the Administration seeks in the Middle East. Avoiding Congressional disapproval might require Mr. Reagan to make some compromises on the sale, and Administration officials say they see no signs of this. The message being sent out from the White House is that the President intends to fight on all fronts. This is his style of leadership, they say, and he is prepared to risk almost everything that he will be able to win. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"President Reagan's administration faced multiple challenges domestically and internationally, as he proposed marginal cuts in military spending and further cuts in domestic spending, facing opposition from both conservatives and liberals. Reagan had to navigate high-stakes battles over budget decisions, interest rates, foreign policy, and defense systems, while the confidence in his economic plan and leadership was under scrutiny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Movie plot: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more... My question: Why was the Yashiromaru sunk fifteen years earlier? Answer:","completion":"The Yashiromaru was sunk fifteen years earlier as part of an insurance fraud scheme. The individuals behind the scheme, which included some members of the Yashiro group, planned to deliberately sink the ship to collect the insurance money. They believed that by sinking the Yashiromaru, they would be able to profit financially from the insurance payout. Kusaka, the scriptwriter and one of the main characters in the movie, later reveals that his father was murdered when he uncovered the truth about the insurance fraud. His father had discovered that the captain of the Yashiromaru was drugged and left to die as part of the plan to sink the ship. This prompted Kusaka to seek justice for his father's death and expose the truth about the Yashiromaru's sinking. Throughout the movie, the characters work to uncover the truth behind the series of murders and mysterious events related to the Yashiromaru and its successor, the Saint Aphrodite. Ultimately, they learn that Akiyoshi, the sub-designer of the cruise, was the main murderer and had masterminded the entire plot. Akiyoshi was motivated by a desire for revenge, as her father was the captain who died in the Yashiromaru sinking. In summary, the Yashiromaru was sunk fifteen years earlier due to an insurance fraud scheme orchestrated by members of the Yashiro group, including Akiyoshi. The sinking of the ship led to a series of murders and other tragic events in the present day, as those who were wronged or had uncovered the truth about the scheme sought justice and revenge."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can use this background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Now, I have a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Answer this question please: Which tetrapod would live shorter, tetA or tetB? The answer to this question is:","completion":"According to Aristotle's theory, the tetrapod that would live a shorter life would be tetB. In the information given about the characteristics of tetA and tetB, it is mentioned that an adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB and also that tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Aristotle's theory on the life-history features of live-bearing tetrapods, translated into simple terms, makes these predictions: 1. The heavier the adult body mass, the longer the mammal's lifespan. In the comparison between an elephant and a mouse, which Aristotle used, the elephant, being much heavier, lives longer. Based on this, since tetA is stated to be heavier than tetB, the theory would predict that tetA would live longer than tetB. 2. Aristotle's theory also proposes that lifespan increases with gestation period, with mammals having a longer gestation period tending to live longer. Elephants again serve as an example of this with their notably long gestation period and correspondingly long lifespan. As stated, tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Following Aristotle's inference, this would again suggest that tetA would have a longer lifespan than tetB. It is worth mentioning that there are always exceptions in nature and life-history characteristics can also be influenced by many other factors such as the rate of predation, availability of food resources and disease. However, strictly speaking, according to Aristotle's interpretations, tetB would live a shorter life compared to tetA due to having a lower adult body mass and a shorter gestation period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The justification for this is to isolate the term with the variable z on one side of the equation. After we subtract 769 from both sides of the equation, we get: 210 = -21*z.

Question: suppose Food is scarce happens, how will it affect More bats come. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"In the scenario where food scarcity occurs, this can have a significant impact on the bat population. The relationship between food availability and an increase in bat numbers is closely linked, as the availability of food resources directly influences bat reproduction, survival rates, and overall population dynamics. A decrease in food availability may lead to the following effects: 1. Less reproduction: Bats require ample food resources to sustain their energy and reproductive needs. Food scarcity can cause bats to delay or reduce their reproductive efforts, leading to fewer offspring being born, and hence, a slower growth rate in their population. 2. Lower survival rates: Food scarcity increases competition among bats for limited resources, resulting in weaker individuals being unable to secure enough food to survive. This leads to a higher mortality rate and a reduction in the overall bat population. 3. Migration and habitat shifts: Bats may respond to food scarcity by changing their foraging behavior or migrating to other areas with more abundant food sources. This can lead to a local decrease in bat numbers as they move elsewhere in search of food. However, this may only be a temporary solution, as increased competition for resources in areas with more bats may eventually cause the same issues. 4. Population fluctuations: Bats are known to experience natural population fluctuations based on food availability and other environmental factors. Food scarcity may exacerbate these fluctuations, making it difficult to determine whether there is a long-term impact on bat populations. Overall, food scarcity is likely to result in a decrease in bat numbers due to a combination of reduced reproduction, increased mortality, and potential changes in habitat use. In summary, the supposed perturbation of food scarcity would have a \\"less\\" effect on the occurrence of more bats. It is essential to address food scarcity issues to maintain healthy bat populations and the ecosystems they inhabit, as bats play a vital role in controlling insect populations and pollination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how is the change of a liquid to a gas measured?\\" is \\"joules\\", given that boiling means changing from liquid to a gas by adding joules ? Choose from: (1). Yes. (2). No. Answer:","completion":"(2). No. The change of a liquid to a gas is a phase transition, which involves a change in energy. While Joules is a unit used to measure energy, it is not a direct answer to the question. The process of measuring this change specifically addresses the combined aspects of heat transfer, internal energy changes, and possibly pressure and temperature. To measure the change of a liquid to a gas, one must examine a few factors: 1. The amount of heat (Q) added or removed to initiate the phase change, which is commonly measured in Joules (J). 2. The specific heat capacity (c), which is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1 degree Celsius. This value varies depending on the substance. 3. The increase or decrease in temperature (ΔT) before the phase change occurs. 4. The mass of the substance (m). 5. The latent heat of vaporization (L), which is the energy required to change a substance from liquid to gas without a change in temperature. Using these variables, the process can be measured by the formula: Q = m(L + cΔT) Where Q represents the total heat exchange, m is the mass of the substance, L is the latent heat of vaporization, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. In summary, Joules is indeed a unit to measure energy, but answering \\"Joules\\" in this context does not adequately explain how the change of a liquid to a gas is measured.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? I was first introduce to this place almost over 5 years ago and it started out great but I think I might have to break up with Teharu. I'm more interested in the food so I'll start with that. I always get my usual when I go here and it's always Hawaiian, Vegas, Dragon, and Bake scallop. Now I live in East Mesa so it is a good 30 minutes drive to get here and let me tell you, it used to be worth it. The last 5 times I've been here has been a miss. Vegas roll was always cold, kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a deep fried roll? No? The Hawaiian roll, which is spicy tuna roll with tuna on top and spicy mayo is always unbearably spicy because I think they are trying to mask away fishy flavour since their fish isn't the greatest of quality, which I knew for the price wasn't going to be the greatest already so when it's extremely spicy, then i can't eat it so...? Now what annoys me is the bake scallop because that was my absolute favorite but lately it's always been disgusting. Like it has a pee smell on the scallop so when you eat it, you feel like your eating someone's piss. I never get to try new rolls anymore because the ones on the belt most of the time looks dried and like it's been there since they opened up for the day. And there's usually 1 left, what's so hard about replenishing it? Or do they wait for that one customer who just eats anything to eat it before they put out more? That's another thing that erks me, if you're a conveyer belt sushi, shouldn't you have someone dedicated to constantly stock the belt with a variety of sushi so that customers can grab? Lately it seems that they focus on orders more and then the belt becomes empty and sad. When can the price of something stop being accountable for the quality you get? Yeah it's cheap but when can we stop saying, oh for the price it's not bad. And this is why restaurants continue to lack and not improve. Oh and for the waiters and waitresses there, I'm not even going to waste my time writing about them because the don't bother wasting their time serving me. So long story short.

Write an article based on this \\"A petition calling for Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump to be barred from entering the UK has gathered more than 370,000 names, so MPs will have to consider debating it.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Rising Up Against Trump: Petition to Bar the Controversial Presidential Hopeful from the UK Introduction: In a historic demonstration of protest, more than 370,000 people have signed a petition calling for Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump to be barred from entering the United Kingdom. Responding to the overwhelming public outcry, Members of Parliament (MPs) must now consider debating the legitimacy of the petition and its ramifications on a multinational level. In the midst of a turbulent political landscape, this move against Trump highlights the deepening divisions surrounding his candidacy and has sparked conversation on the role of global involvement in national politics. I. The Origin of the Movement and Grounds for the Petition The online petition, which has now exceeded well over 370,000 signatures, first attracted widespread attention after Trump proposed a temporary halt on Muslims entering the United States. This came in response to what he perceived as a growing international security threat, which included incidents like the Paris terrorist attacks and the San Bernardino shooting. Consequently, Trump’s divisive rhetoric and controversial policy proposal provided the primary impetus for the petition. Additionally, this movement against Trump stems from what many perceive as his blatant disregard for civil liberties and basic human rights. His discriminatory rhetoric has also been fueled by his inflammatory comments against women, ethnic minorities, and individuals with disabilities. II. Reaction from International Diplomats and the United Nations While the petition has garnered attention and support from thousands worldwide, including notable public figures and politicians, international diplomats and United Nations officials have strongly condemned Trump's proposed policies as \\"truly shocking” and \\"inherently discriminating.\\" A spokesperson for United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, stated that Trump's statements and policy proposals reflect the very xenophobic attitudes and principles that world leaders have committed to combating over the years. Zeid also expressed concern that if these proposals were executed, they could lead to further discrimination and infringement on human rights. III. Precedents for Barring Entry into the UK and the Legal Ramifications The UK Home Office has previously used its authority to deny entry to individuals who are believed to have engaged in unacceptable behavior or pose a genuine threat to public safety. Individuals who have been barred from the UK include anti-Islamic pastor Terry Jones, far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, and conservative talk show host Michael Savage. However, barring Trump from the UK would not only have legal implications but also potential ramifications on international diplomacy. Preventing him from entering the country could exacerbate tensions between the United States and the UK, straining their longstanding alliance and potentially influencing shared policy initiatives. Furthermore, it could set a dangerous precedent of international interference in the electoral politics of sovereign nations. IV. The Potential Parliamentary Debate and the Voice of the Public As a result of the sheer number of signatures, UK MPs are obliged to consider debating the petition, giving a platform to the concerns of the thousands of individuals who have voiced their discontent with Trump’s proposed policies. The debate could take place in the House of Commons, a public setting that would draw substantial media attention and hold significant weight. The prospect of a parliamentary debate is powerful; it not only underscores the importance of the public's voice in the political process but also the ability of people from various nations to unite in solidarity against perceived injustice. This signals a significant moment in political history, where the role of global citizenship in shaping national politics is becoming increasingly evident. Conclusion: The petition to bar Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump from the UK represents an extraordinary response to both his controversial policy proposals and his divisive rhetoric. As MPs consider debating, and ultimately deciding on the matter, this issue ultimately underscores the importance of public opinion in today's political landscape and raises questions about the role of global citizenship in matters of national politics. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is certain — the widespread attention to this petition reflects an ever-growing commitment to ensuring that civil liberties and human rights are upheld around the world."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

It should also have the minimum(=least) number of air bubbles. Perfectly clear ice blocks weighing 140 kg and measuring 100 cmx50 cmx25 cm are available from the Clinebell Company in Colorado . Much larger clear blocks are produced in Europe and Canada or harvested from a frozen river in Sweden . These large ice blocks are used for large ice sculpting events and for building ice hotels. Another difficulty in the process of ice sculpting is time control . The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting . If the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment , then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece . The tools used for sculpting also affect when the task can be finished . Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if power tools are used . Ice sculptors also use sharp chisels that are specifically designed for cutting ice . The best ice chisels are made in Japan , a country that , along with China , has a long tradition of magnificent ice sculptures . Ice sculptures are used as decorations in some cuisines , especially in Asia . When holding a dinner party , some large restaurants or hotels will use an ice sculpture to decorate the table .

In order to secure the throne, General Sapt and his nephew Fritz travel to London, where the King's son, Rudolf V (Sellers), resides and lives through the day in London's pleasure establishments; but the King's demented half-brother Michael (Kemp), thinking that he is the better claimant, sends an assassin after them. Hansom cab driver Sydney (or Sidney) Frewin (Sellers), the new King's half-brother from an affair with a British actress, rescues Rudolf from an assassination attempt. Once his resemblance to the King is noticed, Frewin is hired by the general ostensibly as the King's coachman, but actually to play the role of decoy. The ruse is quickly uncovered, however, when during an attack by Michael's men the royal guardsmen address Frewin as their new king, and the two look-alikes get acquainted. In an unattended moment, Rudolf is captured and brought to Michael's castle of Zenda. Out of necessity, Frewin has to keep masquerading as the King for the coronation ceremony. Princess Flavia, Rudolf's fiancÃ©e (Frederick), is perceptive enough to see through the ruse, and after Frewin and the general have confided in her, she quickly becomes Frewin's trusted ally and love interest. Complicating the scheme on Frewin's side is the jealous Count Montparnasse whose wife (Sommer) has become infatuated with Rudolf, and on Michael's side by his mistress, Antoinette, who is wildly jealous about the prospect of Michael marrying Flavia and in turn is the love interest of the slightly unbalanced Rupert von Henzau, Michael's second-in-command. After several assassination attempts, Michael attempts to lure Frewin into a trap. While the trap fails, Frewin, acting as Henzau's coach driver, is recognized and captured upon arrival in Zenda. Frewin and Rudolf escape with Antoinette's and Henzau's help, just as Sapt and his men arrive at the castle. Henzau rides away, telling Sapt to tell the King that he (Henzau) will report next...

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The United State's trade and fuel embargo made against Japan\\" correctly answer the question \\"What resulted in the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor?\\"?

Most questions can have only one correct answer. Passage: Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, \\"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\\" In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, \\"It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was \\"the biggest mistake I ever made\\" and \\"I was always a closet heterosexual.\\" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, \\"I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people.\\" Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in \\"puritanical\\" America, \\"I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.\\"Buckley wrote that Bowie \\"mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock\\", and was probably \\"never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual\\", instead experimenting \\"out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'.\\" Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie \\"created their bisexual fantasy\\". Sandford wrote that Bowie \\"made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women.\\" The BBC's Mark Easton wrote in 2016 that Britain was \\"far more tolerant of difference\\" and that gay rights, such as same-sex marriage, and gender equality would not have \\"enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago\\". Question: What is the name of the person who claims he was always a closet heterosexual? A:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the person who claims he was always a closet heterosexual. Usage: In the passage, it is stated that \\"Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was 'the biggest mistake I ever made' and 'I was always a closet heterosexual.'\\" This meets the criteria because it identifies Bowie as the person who claims he was always a closet heterosexual.

Article: SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Weight Watchers is betting its future on two letters. The health-and-wellness company is changing its name to WW, as Chief Executive Officer Mindy Grossman tries to draw more consumers to the weight-loss program in a bid to extend the momentum fueled by Oprah Winfrey’s embrace of the brand nearly three years ago. Weight Watchers, which has been updating its technology and reshaping its diet plan, becomes the latest company to embrace its initials. And as Grossman puts her stamp on the brand, she’s pulling from a playbook used at Home Shopping Network, where she mounted a turnaround at the company that had switched its corporate name to HSN. \\"We will go through a period where people will have to understand Weight Watchers reimagined,\\" Grossman said in an interview last week at WW headquarters in Manhattan. As part of WW’s move to focus on overall health, the company is launching a program in the U.S. next month where members earn rewards including products for tracking meals, activity and weight. The WW app will be updated on Oct. 4, and starting in January 2019, WW products sold directly to consumers will have no artificial sweeteners or preservatives. WW shares are up less than 1 percent, after earlier falling as much as 1.7 percent. Cyclicality There’s mounting pressure on Grossman to prove she can sustain the Oprah-fueled turnaround. The company’s shares have gained nearly 60 percent this year, after surging almost 300 percent in 2017 as advertisements featuring the well-known media mogul helped bring customers back to the weight-loss program after a difficult stretch that saw the company’s shares sink below 4 in 2015. Shares of WW took a hit in August after the company posted second-quarter results, causing a 15 percent selloff the next day. While WW reported profit that topped estimates, the full-year guidance and subscriber forecast drew concern from SunTrust analyst Michael Swartz. Grossman stands proudly behind the quarter’s results, noting the number of subscribers in the quarter increased by 1 million from the year-ago period. \\"I think its ultimately educating people that yeah, we have growth, but there is some cyclicality to the business,\\" she said. Winfrey took a stake in the company and agreed to pitch the brand in October 2015, sending the shares flying. At the time, Weight Watchers was heavily in debt, and suffering through subscriber losses amid the rise of fitness apps. Grossman succeeded Chief Executive Jim Chambers in July 2017. Now, in her reshaping of the company, Grossman’s changes include a new product look to reflect the updated design of WW. And she’s taking a page from her time at HSN, where she turned the company from a staid shopping channel into a lifestyle brand, transforming its image from an outlet known for pushing products like the Suzanne Somers ThighMaster. The TV shopping network was acquired by QVC’s parent company Liberty Interactive, in a 2.1 billion deal earlier this year. \\"What Mindy has done with the brand has been nothing short of a phenomenon,\\" said Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy in a phone interview. \\"She turned Weight Watchers from being a liability to an asset.\\" WW has garnered interest from a number of new analysts this year, with nine firms initiating coverage, according to Bloomberg data. Weight Watchers has nine buys and five hold ratings with an average price target 100. Not one analyst is bearish on the company, which traded Friday at more than 69 a share. Oprah’s Presence Investors are placing a lot of faith in Grossman’s ability to transform the company but they are also watching Oprah’s moves very closely. Back in January, WW rose as much as 15 percent amid talks of \\"Oprah for President.\\" The shares quickly slipped after Oprah shut down the rumors weeks later. It’s unclear what role Oprah will play in the upcoming advertisements during the key diet season. Grossman gave no indication on the faces of the winter ad campaign but she did mention that WW has been very engaged with Oprah and the other influencers. The company relies on the winter season to draw in subscribers who have made New Year’s resolutions to lose weight. \\"We are working right now on exactly what that (campaign) will look like going into 2019,\\" said Grossman. \\"It’s all under concept development, globally.\\" — With assistance by Richard Richtmyer ||||| Credit: Weight Watchers/WW Weight Watchers is taking its biggest step yet to alter people's perceptions about the brand: It's changing its name. The company announced Monday that it's now called WW—which it says pays homage to the brand's heritage (it was founded 55 years ago by Jean Nidetch as a weight-loss company) but shifts the focus from dieting to wellness. Its new tagline: \\"Wellness that Works.\\" People no longer need a weight loss goal to join up, for one. And starting Oct. 4, the company's app will be updated: A new program, WellnessWins (there's that double W again), will reward WW members for things like tracking their meals and attending wellness workshops; the FitPoints algorithm will be more personalized and encourage high-intensity and strength-training exercises; and new groups are being added for people with common interests (think: vegetarians, new moms, yoga fans). WW is also partnering with meditation app company Headspace on customized content that comes out later this fall (first in English only, and later German and French). \\"These are ways that our brand can show up as healthy living, so much more beyond just diet,\\" President and CEO Mindy Grossman, who has been overseeing the company's overhaul since she joined in mid-2017, tells Ad Age. The company also said that by January all WW foods will be free from artificial colors, flavors, preservatives and sweeteners. And a beta version of voice integration with Amazon Alexa and the Google assistant lets members ask about the points values of their food and more. WW also wants to be seen in unexpected places. A WW Freestyle Cafe opens at the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn on Oct. 4 and plans to be there for at least a year; it features \\"healthy Mediterranean\\" entrees, sides and desserts by chef Cat Cora. There will also be a WW Freestyle choice in each of the other food venues there, along with brand activations. A WW Freestyle promotion took place at the Giants home opener via a food truck outside MetLife Stadium on Sept. 9, featuring dishes such as lobster rolls and mac and cheese served by Eric Greenspan, as well as an in-venue activation. As part of the overhaul, says Grossman, the company had interviewed thousands of people about how the brand impacted their lives. Not one person started their answer with how much weight they'd lost, she says; instead, each first spoke about how their lives were better or had been changed. Credit: Weight Watchers Even before the name change, the company was making a subtle shift beyond a weight-loss focus, promoting programs with names such as \\"Beyond the Scale,\\" and had raised its profit forecast for the year. WW ended the second quarter with 4.5 million subscribers, up 1 million from a year earlier, the company said in August. At that time, its chief financial officer said that average retention was exceeding nine months globally, which was an increase of more than 15 percent versus three years ago. \\"I would like to be able to start talking about retention in years, not months,\\" says Grossman. WW worked with SYPartners on its transformation plans. New ads from Anomaly are expected to start running in December. No word yet on whether board member and investor Oprah Winfrey will appear in that new campaign. |||||Summary:","completion":"Weight Watchers is rebranding to WW, seeking to reposition itself as a wellness company rather than a weight-loss business. The move is part of an overhaul that will see WW focusing on nutrition and overall health, while items on its food range will not contain artificial sweeteners or preservatives. CEO Mindy Grossman has also sought to forge partnerships with exercise companies in a bid to align the company more with fitness and wellbeing. The rebrand comes as shares of WW have risen by almost 60% this year, reversing a slump in recent years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"In 2012, the currency in Slovakia was the Euro (€), which is the official currency of the European Union (EU) and is used by 19 of its 27 member states. Slovakia officially adopted the Euro on January 1, 2009, replacing its previous currency, the Slovak Koruna (SKK). The transition from the Slovak Koruna to the Euro was managed by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The exchange rate between the Slovak Koruna and the Euro was set at 1 Euro = 30.1260 Slovak Korunas. Prior to the adoption of the Euro, the Slovak Koruna had been in circulation since 1993, when Czechoslovakia split into two independent countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Adopting the Euro as its official currency meant that Slovakia became a part of the Eurozone, which is the economic and monetary union responsible for the management of the Euro. As a Eurozone member, Slovakia benefits from lower transaction costs when trading with other member countries, more stable prices, and easier loans and financing. The Euro itself is administered and managed by the ECB and the Eurosystem, which consists of the central banks of the EU countries that use the Euro. The ECB is responsible for setting monetary policy for the Euro area and ensuring financial stability in the region. Coins and banknotes issued in the Eurozone display a combination of shared European designs and national designs. The common side of the coins features images of the European Union or a map of Europe. The national side, which is specific to each member country, typically depicts national symbols or landmarks. In Slovakia, the national side of the coins features the Bratislava Castle, the national emblem - a double cross on three hills, and the \\"Madonna and Child\\" by Master Paul of Levoča. In conclusion, the currency in Slovakia in 2012 was the Euro, which had been adopted as the country's official currency in 2009. As a Eurozone member, Slovakia enjoys various economic benefits, such as lower transaction costs and increased price stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What most naturally follows? How to reduce teenage classroom stress Manage your time more effectively. Stress related to schoolwork is often caused by a sense that there is too much work to do and too little time to do it all. Just as often, however, better time management skills can reduce schoolwork backlogs-and reduce stress in the process.","completion":"The next step in reducing teenage classroom stress would be improving study habits and techniques, which can significantly alleviate stress levels and improve academic performance. 1. Develop a routine: Consistency is crucial to making a study habit stick. Encourage teenagers to establish a dependable daily study routine and stick to it. This routine should be tailored to their needs and preferences, taking into account their optimal study times and the environment they feel most comfortable studying in. 2. Break tasks into smaller chunks: Breaking down large tasks or assignments into smaller, more manageable sections can help prevent feeling overwhelmed. This approach allows teenagers to feel more in control of their workload, enabling them to make gradual progress and build momentum. 3. Prioritize tasks: Encourage teenagers to prioritize their work according to deadlines and importance. This will help them tackle the most pressing assignments first and alleviate stress. It is also essential to make time for revising and reviewing material regularly to keep the information fresh in their minds. 4. Use effective study techniques: Techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique, active reading, summarizing information, and using mnemonic devices can greatly enhance the learning process and improve retention. Encourage teenagers to explore and adopt study techniques that work best for them. 5. Stay organized: Maintaining an organized workspace and keeping track of notes, handouts, and assignments will help prevent chaos, which can hinder productivity. Additionally, using an agenda or planner to keep track of deadlines and responsibilities can help reduce stress associated with forgetting assignments or feeling disorganized. 6. Seek help when needed: Encourage teenagers to ask for help from teachers, tutors, or peers when they're struggling with a concept or assignment. Seeking help early on can prevent confusion from escalating into stress. 7. Maintain a healthy balance: While academic success is important, it's crucial not to lose sight of personal well-being. Encourage teens to maintain a balanced lifestyle by participating in extracurricular activities, engaging in hobbies, and spending time with friends and family. These activities can serve as outlets for stress relief and help promote mental well-being. 8. Get enough sleep: Teenagers should aim for at least 8-10 hours of sleep per night. Sleep is essential for memory consolidation, focus, and overall well-being. Encourage them to create a consistent bedtime routine and keep their sleeping environment comfortable and free from distractions. 9. Practice stress-relief techniques: Encourage teenagers to explore and utilize stress-relief techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, meditation, or yoga. Even taking short breaks during study sessions to practice these techniques can help maintain focus and reduce stress. 10. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage teens to view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than barriers to success. Emphasize to them that setbacks are a natural part of learning and can ultimately lead to growth if approached with resilience and a positive attitude. Reducing classroom stress in teenagers can have long-lasting effects on their overall well-being and academic success. By implementing these strategies, teenagers can learn to manage their stress effectively and perform at their best both in and out of the classroom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The theatre also won best production, for An Enemy of the People, while its artistic director David Thacker won the special achievement award. The Octagon's haul of six awards marked Thacker's final year as artistic director at the theatre. But Maxine Peake, shortlisted in two categories, went home empty-handed. The annual awards - chosen by a panel of 10 of the region's leading theatre critics - were handed out in Manchester on Friday. Colin Connor and Barbara Drennan won best actor and best actress respectively for A View from The Bridge, also directed by Thacker, with the Arthur Miller play picking up a third award for Natasha Davidson, for best supporting actress. Connor won a second award, for being the writer, director and performer in Mr Smith at the Kings Arms, Salford, winning best performance in a fringe production. David Birrell won best supporting actor for his part in Thacker's An Enemy of the People. Peake was nominated for best actress - for her role as a demonic fairy in The Skriker at the Royal Exchange theatre - and for the new play award for writing Beryl, about cycling champion Beryl Burton, which was staged at The Lowry in Salford. She was beaten to the new play award by The Rolling Stone, by Chris Urch at the Royal Exchange. The Royal Court's production of Constellations won three awards - best visiting productions, best actress in a visiting production (Louise Brealey) and best actor in a visiting production (Joe Armstrong) - beating households names including Sophie Thompson and Michael Ball. The Palace theatre's production of The Bodyguard won best musical in a shortlist that included Guys and Dolls and Mack & Mabel, while the Royal Northern College Of Music's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream won best opera. Analysis - Chris Long, entertainment reporter at the awards In the foyer before the awards, the talk was mostly about the flurrying snow that was blanketing Manchester on a bitterly cold day, but in the theatre it was another force from the North that took breaths away - that of Bolton Octagon. The theatre has fought hard to build a formidable reputation in recent years, a success which will be rewarded with a new Â£10m building in 2019, and its big wins in the acting categories showed just why it has become so highly regarded. For the town's most well-known actress though, things didn't go so well as Maxine Peake failed to pick up an award for either her acting in the well-received The Skriker or her writing of the play Beryl. She's not exactly in Leonardo DiCaprio territory, given she has been crowned by the awards before, but after she failed to win for her critically-acclaimed Hamlet in 2015, missing out again felt like something of a shock. David Thacker, the Octagon's artistic director, did have a Leonardo moment as his acceptance speech took in climate change and a fair few raised eyebrows. He, like many though, was working off the cuff as it seemed very few of the winners expected to win. That led to charming and gushing moments - the sweetest of which belonged to a member of the victorious Contact Youth Company, who grinningly said discovering and joining the group had \\"literally changed my life\\".

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who is accused of being a devil? is inside the article: Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue., can you guess it ?

For this task, I will consider an imaginary restaurant called \\"The Unhappy Chef\\". Step 2: Set the tone - As this review is intended to be negative, I will make sure to convey dissatisfaction and disappointment with various aspects of the restaurant experience. Step 3: Describe the overall experience - I will start the review by summarizing the general experience at the restaurant, focusing on negative aspects.

Step 5: End the review - I will conclude the review with a summary of the main issues and a final comment or recommendation based on the negative experience. Negative review for The Unhappy Chef: I had high hopes for The Unhappy Chef, but my recent experience there was disheartening. As soon as I entered the restaurant, I noticed musty and uninviting smells, which immediately dampened my enthusiasm. Unfortunately, the rest of my visit did nothing to improve my impression of the place. Our server took a long time to approach us, and when they did, they seemed distracted and unhelpful. It took even longer to get our drinks, and when they finally arrived, they were both mixed inconsistently - my dining partner's mojito was watery, while my margarita was overly sour and lacked the right balance of flavors. The slow and careless service continued throughout the evening. The food, which was one of the main reasons I wanted to try this restaurant, turned out to be a major disappointment. My pasta dish was undercooked and barely covered in sauce, whereas my partner's steak was overcooked, even though we explicitly requested medium-rare. Both dishes lacked flavor and finesse, which is not what I expected from a restaurant with such a promising menu. The final disappointment came in the form of a hefty bill that didn't seem to reflect the poor quality of food and service we received. All in all, I can't recommend The Unhappy Chef and won't be returning in the future. It seems as though they need to reevaluate their priorities and focus on providing a better overall dining experience for their customers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If Clinton's spokesmen have learned to brush off Republican critics of engagement by quoting the policy's Republican defenders., can we conclude that \\"Clinton's spokesmen have nothing to say to Republican critics.\\"? Possible answers: 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no;","completion":"3). No, we cannot conclude that \\"Clinton's spokesmen have nothing to say to Republican critics\\" based on this information. It is important to look at the context in which Clinton's spokesmen are quoting Republican defenders of engagement. The fact that they are quoting Republican supporters of the policy indicates that they are actively engaging with their critics from the opposing party and responding to their concerns or criticisms. By quoting Republican defenders, Clinton's spokesmen are essentially saying, \\"Look, even members of your own party agree with our approach.\\" This action serves at least two important purposes: 1. It highlights the bipartisan nature of the policy, which reflects positively on Clinton's administration, as it shows that the policy is not based on partisan ideologies but rather on practical and strategic considerations that are backed by experts from both sides of the aisle. 2. It effectively counters the criticism to some degree by pointing out the inconsistencies within the Republican critics' own party, which may lead some of them to question or reevaluate their stance on the issue. Moreover, Clinton's spokesmen may indeed have other arguments, facts, and statistics at their disposal to help bolster the case for the policy in question. Quoting Republican defenders may just be one tool in their arsenal, serving as a strategic counterpoint to silence Republican critics. It's important to note, however, that just because they use this tactic does not automatically mean that their arguments will be entirely convincing or immune to criticism from their opponents. Rather, it's a way for them to engage in the political discourse and present multiple perspectives in support of their policy. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Clinton's spokesmen have nothing to say to Republican critics simply because they are quoting Republican defenders of engagement. Instead, it appears that they are actively responding to their critics and presenting arguments to support their policy, while also using bipartisan support as a way of gaining greater credibility in the eyes of the public."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the following passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.

The equation is given as: -32*j + 6*j - 1093 - 521 = -470 To combine the terms with the variable j: -32*j and 6*j are in the same family since they both contain the variable j.

We will first add 1614 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -1614 term: -26j - 1614 + 1614 = -470 + 1614 This simplifies to: -26j = 1144 Now, to solve for j, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -26: (-26j) / -26 = 1144 / -26 Simplifying further, we get: j = -44 Thus, the solution to the math problem is j = -44."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A single brick, of course. Like a brick wall, your body is composed of basic building blocks, and the building blocks of your body are cells. Your body has many kinds of cells, each specialized for a specific purpose. Just as a home is made from a variety of building materials, the human body is constructed from many cell types. For example, epithelial cells protect the surface of the body and cover the organs and body cavities within. Bone cells help to support and protect the body. Cells of the immune system fight invading bacteria. Additionally, blood and blood cells carry nutrients and oxygen throughout the body while removing carbon dioxide. Each of these cell types plays a vital role during the growth, development, and day-to-day maintenance of the body. In spite of their enormous variety, however, cells from all organisms—even ones as diverse as bacteria, onion, and human—share certain fundamental characteristics.

Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events. It is also \\"the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events\\". - Diffuse reflection is the reflection of light from a surface such that an incident ray is reflected at many angles rather than at just one angle as in the case of specular reflection. An illuminated \\"ideal\\" diffuse reflecting surface will have equal luminance from all directions which lie in the half-space adjacent to the surface (Lambertian reflectance). - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - The hexagonal snowflake , a crystalline formation of ice , has intrigued people throughout history . This is a chronology of interest and research into snowflakes . Artists , philosophers , and scientists have wondered at their shape , recorded them by hand or in photographs , and attempted to recreate hexagonal snowflakes . - A spectrum (plural \\"spectra\\" or \\"spectrums\\") is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without steps, across a continuum. The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. - A snowflake is either a single ice crystal or an aggregation of ice crystals which falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order, sometimes described as a project artifact. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD.

It was introduced in 1906 as a successor to the Models A and C as the company 's inexpensive entry - level line . It was built at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant . The Model N diverged from its predecessors in that it was a front - engine car with a 4 - cylinder engine . The 15 hp straight - 4 drove the rear wheels via a long shaft . This was also the first American car to use vanadium steel . The car had a wheelbase of 84 in ( 2,100 mm ) . A successful model , 7000 cars were made before production ended in 1908 . At US 500 , the car was viewed as highly affordable at the time ; by contrast , the high - volume Oldsmobile Runabout went for 650 , Western 's Gale Model A was 500 , the Brush Runabout 485 , the Black went for as low as 375 , and the Success hit the amazingly low 250 . Maroon was the only factory color for the Model N. - The Ford Model T (colloquially known as the Tin Lizzie, TModel Ford, Model T, T, Leaping Lena, or flivver) is an automobile that was produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927. It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, the car that opened travel to the common middle-class American; some of this was because of Ford's efficient fabrication, including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting. - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose \\"middle\\" compositional period was after 1901? is inside the article: The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W...., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Mahler"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"All of them, and 30 days\\" correctly answer the question \\"How many defendants were ordered to pay the maximum fine of 1000, and how long after a PFA is filed does the plaintiff have to establish a custody order?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"All of them, and 30 days\\" does not correctly answer the question. According to the paragraph, no defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine, so the correct answer should be \\"None of them, and 30 days.\\" The paragraph states that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Four Republican hopefuls return money after 'Dylann Roof manifesto' revelation Related: Leader of group cited in 'Dylann Roof manifesto' donated to top Republicans Four presidential hopefuls were among 16 Republicans who on Monday gave up more than 30,000 in campaign contributions from the leader of a white nationalist group said to have influenced the Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof. Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum led a GOP group spanning Congress and statehouses who said they would donate to charity or return money from Earl Holt, following the publication of a Guardian article on Sunday. Other Republicans who have taken money from Holt declined to comment about the contributions. Holt, the president of the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC), has contributed more than 74,000 to Republican candidates and committees in recent years, according to public filings, while making dozens of racist statements online. His organisation, which is labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, was cited by the author of an extremist manifesto posted on a website registered in Roof’s name and hosting photographs of the 21-year-old. Walker, the Wisconsin governor, will pass the 3,000 Holt gave his state campaigns to a charity, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman, said in an email. Walker is expected to officially announce a campaign for president in the coming weeks. His decision followed 2016 candidates Paul, a senator for Kentucky, Cruz, a senator for Texas, and Santorum, a former senator for Pennsylvania, passing a total of 14,250 they received from Holt to a memorial fund for Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine people were shot dead last week. “I abhor the sentiments Mr Holt has expressed. These statements and sentiments are unacceptable. Period. End of sentence,” Santorum said in a statement. The manifesto author, widely reported but not verified as Roof, recounted learning about “brutal black on white murders” from the CfCC website. “At this moment I realised that something was very wrong,” the manifesto said. Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder. He is accused of joining a Bible study group at the church last Wednesday evening and opening fire, declaring that the attack was racially motivated before fleeing in his car. Jared Taylor, a spokesman for the CoCC, said in a statement on Monday that its leaders “utterly condemn” Roof’s alleged killings, but said the shootings “do not detract in the slightest from the legitimacy of some of the positions he has expressed”. Taylor said: “Ignoring legitimate grievances is dangerous.” Another 6,500 in Holt campaign contributions are to be donated to the church fund from senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Rob Portman of Ohio and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, along with representatives Ryan Zinke of Montana, Louie Gohmert of Texas, and Mark Sanford of South Carolina. Spokespeople for the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who received a combined 5,000 in campaign contributions from Holt, according to filings, said they would be giving the money to charity. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Representative Mia Love of Utah – the first black female Republican in Congress – said they would be returning a total of 2,500 in contributions to Holt. “I do not agree with his hateful beliefs and language and believe they are hurtful to our country,” Cotton said in a statement. In a statement published on Sunday, Holt said it was “not surprising” that Roof was apparently informed by the group’s website as it reported race relations “accurately and honestly”. However, he added: “The CofCC is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.” Current members of congress, state officials, or candidates who received campaign contributions from Earl Holt, president of Council of Conservative Citizens, according to FEC and state filings: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas* – 8,500 – donating 11,000 to Charleston church fund Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin – 3,500 – donating to charity Governor Greg Abbott of Texas – 3,000 – donating to Salvation Army in Austin Representative Steve King of Iowa – 2,500 Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska – 2,000 – donating to community centre Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky* – 1,750 – donating to Charleston church fund Former Senator Rick Santorum – 1,500 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas – 1,500 – returning contributions Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas* – 1,250 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin – 1,250 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa – 1,000 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona – 1,000 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina – 1,000 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana – 1,000 Representative Mia Love of Utah – 1,000 – returning contributions Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin* – 1,000 State representative David Simpson of Texas – 750 State senator Konni Burton of Texas – 750 Representative Thomas Emmer of Minnesota – 500 Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana – 500 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Dean Heller of Nevada – 500 Senator Jim Risch of Idaho – 500 Representative Kenneth Buck of Colorado – 500 Senator Rob Portman of Ohio – 250 – donating to Charleston church fund Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina – 250 State representative Matthew Schaefer of Texas – 250 Texas supreme court judge Jeff Brown – 250 Former candidates and members of congress who received campaign contributions from Holt Todd Akin, US senate candidate in Missouri – 3,500 Michele Bachmann, US representative for Minnesota and US presidential primary candidate – 3,200 Richard Mourdock, US senate candidate in Indiana – 2,500 Mitt Romney, US presidential candidate – 2,000 Chris McDaniel, US senate primary candidate in Mississippi – 2,000 Charles Djou, US house candidate in Hawaii – 2,000 Josh Mandel, US senate candidate in Ohio – 1,500 Linda McMahon, US senate candidate in Connecticut – 1,500 Allen West*, US representative for Florida – 1,250 Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia governor candidate – 1,000 George Allen, US senate candidate in Virginia – 1,000 Rick Berg, US representative and US senate candidate for North Dakota – 1,000 Dennis Rehberg, US representative and US senate candidate for Montana – 1,000 Mark Neumann, US senate candidate in Wisconsin – 1,000 Sharron Angle, US senate candidate in Nevada – 1,000 Paul Broun, US representative and US senate primary candidate for Georgia – 1,000 Rob Maness, US senate primary candidate in Louisiana – 1,000 Quico Canseco, US representative and US house primary candidate for Texas – 750 Peter Hoekstra, US representative and US senate candidate for Michigan – 500 Tom Smith, US senate candidate in Pennsylvania – 500 Dan Liljenquist, state senator and US senate primary candidate in Utah – 500 JD Hayworth, US representative and US senate primary candidate for Arizona – 500 Dino Rossi, state senator and US senate candidate in Washington – 500 Philip Eby, state house primary candidate in Texas – 500 Jeff Bell, US senate candidate in New Jersey – 500 Donald Webb, US house candidate in North Carolina – 500 Joe Miller, US senate primary candidate in Alaska – 500 Jim Oberweis, state senator and US senate candidate in Illinois – 500 Steve Lonegan, US senate candidate in New Jersey – 500 John Raese, US senate candidate in West Virginia – 500 Conservative campaign committees that received contributions from Holt Senate Conservatives Fund PAC – 1,000 Madison Project PAC – 250 *Total includes contributions to candidate’s leadership Pac Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Four Republican presidential hopefuls and 12 other party members have returned or donated over 30,000 in campaign contributions from Earl Holt, leader of a white nationalist group linked to Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof, following the publication of a Guardian article.

C is incorrect because it talks about friendships, but the topic is about building chemistry for a romantic relationship, not growing a friendship.

Sent 2: After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Sent 3: Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. Sent 4: President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. Sent 5: He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. Sent 6: In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. Sent 7: He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. Sent 8: His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. Sent 9: As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Sent 10: Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. Sent 11: On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Sent 12: Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\"Sent 13: Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. Sent 14: One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. Sent 15: He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. Sent 16: After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. Sent 17: After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. Sent 18: With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

He carefully rubbed the soap on his wet hair, making sure to create a lot of bubbles. Bubbles are what help get rid of dirt and grime, so he needed lots of them.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the person who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora?, using the article: Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic..., what would be the answer ?

Its most recent Companies House filing shows the company as making a pre-tax loss of £28.5m last year, but the firm also paid its 362 UK staff a total of £35.4m in share bonuses. The share bonuses amount to £96,000 on average per UK Facebook employee. It means Facebook's UK corporation tax bill was less than the tax the average UK employee paid on their salary. The average UK salary is £26,500 on which employees pay a total of £5,392.80 in income tax and national insurance contributions. In January, Facebook reported global fourth-quarter profits of 701m (£462m), a 34% increase on the same period a year earlier. Total profits for the year were 2.9bn, almost double its profit for 2013. Facebook said at the time that advertising revenue grew by 53% to 3.59bn, with nearly 70% of that coming from mobile ad sales. The social networking giant says it now has 1.39 billion active users each month, a 13% increase from a year ago. The latest revelations will reignite the debate about how much UK corporation tax companies pay at a time when several multinational corporations are being investigated by the European Commission over the tax arrangements they have with European Union member states. Google, Amazon, a division of the Fiat motor company and Starbucks are all subject to the investigation and the European Commission has said it could widen its probe further. The investigation came after Starbucks was revealed to have paid just £8.6m in UK corporation tax in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, despite making more than £3bn in UK sales in the same period. Last week, EU finance ministers agreed to boost information sharing in response to the so-called LuxLeaks scandal that emerged last year. The scandal showed Luxembourg had issued hundreds of tax rulings allowing companies to lower their tax bill by funnelling their profits through the country. A spokesperson for Facebook said: \\"We are compliant with UK tax law, and in fact in all countries where we have operations and offices. We continue to grow our business activities in the UK.\\" They added that all the firm's employees paid UK income tax on their payouts. The company recently secured the lease on a high-profile 227,324 sq ft office space in Rathbone Square, near Tottenham Court Road in London, where it plans to open a new headquarters in 2017. John O'Connell, director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, a think tank that campaigns for lower taxes and highlights examples of government waste, said: \\"Taxpayers will be justifiably confused and angry about this tax bill. But Facebook is right to say that it is complying with UK law, which shows that the problem lies with our complex tax code, and that is what politicians should address as a matter of urgency. \\"We have to ensure our taxes are simple to eliminate loopholes, and that taxes are low to increase our competitiveness, so that companies choose to base themselves here.\\" Conservative MP Mark Garnier, a member of Parliament's Treasury Select Committee told the BBC that even if companies were not breaking any laws, they should think about their moral responsibility. \\"It's about the spirit of the law versus the letter of the law. At the end of the day tax evasion is illegal, when you're deliberately setting out to not pay your tax by hiding your money,\\" he said. \\"Tax planning is what most people will be doing with their pensions. And tax avoidance is where you take the letter of the law, to get around the spirit of the law, where you're actively seeking a way of using the letters to not pay tax.\\" In his March Budget, Chancellor George Osborne pressed ahead with plans to introduce a diverted profits tax on companies that moved their profits overseas. He added that firms that aided tax evasion would also face new penalties and criminal prosecutions. The so-called \\"Google Tax\\" is designed to discourage large companies diverting profits out of the UK to avoid tax. And last week, an OECD/G20 report found that laws allowing companies to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions meant between 100bn and 240bn was lost in tax revenues every year - equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporate tax revenues.

Please answer this question: In which sport is the 'Giro D'Italia'?","completion":"The Giro d'Italia, often referred to as simply \\"The Giro,\\" is a professional cycling race held in the sport of road cycling. Established in 1909, the Giro d'Italia is one of the three Grand Tours of professional cycling, alongside the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. The Giro is held annually, primarily taking place throughout the numerous regions of Italy, with occasional stages crossing the borders to nearby countries. The race is organized by La Gazzetta dello Sport, an Italian sports newspaper, and spans over a three-week period, usually in May. Like other Grand Tours, the Giro d'Italia features various stages that challenge riders in multiple aspects of road cycling, such as flat stages, individual and team time trials, and mountainous stages. These diverse stages result in an overall race that tests a cyclist's endurance, strength, climbing ability, and tactical nous. The Giro d'Italia consists of 21 stages, and the rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the race is declared the overall winner. Throughout the race, additional competitions take place that focus on different aspects of the sport, such as the Points Classification (for sprinters), the Mountains Classification (for climbers), and the Best Young Rider classification for cyclists under the age of 25. Several iconic symbols are associated with the Giro, such as the 'Maglia Rosa' (Pink Jersey), which is awarded to the overall leader of the race. The Pink Jersey is an iconic symbol in the world of professional cycling, as it signifies the wearer's current standing as the overall race leader. The color pink is a nod to the race-organizing newspaper, La Gazzetta dello Sport, whose pages are printed on pink paper. Other significant jerseys include the Maglia Ciclamino (Cyclamen Jersey) for the Points Classification leader, the Maglia Azzurra (Blue Jersey) for the Mountains Classification leader, and the Maglia Bianca (White Jersey) for the leader in the Best Young Rider classification. The Giro d'Italia is an important cultural event in Italy and is followed closely by fans both nationally and internationally. Similar to the Tour de France, the Giro is seen as a prestigious race in the professional cycling calendar, with a rich history of legendary riders such as Fausto Coppi, Gino Bartali, Eddy Merckx, and more recent winners like Chris Froome and Alberto Contador. The race showcases not only the athleticism and dedication of the cyclists but also the beautiful landscapes, scenic routes, and vibrant culture of Italy and the surrounding regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

AM Eluned Parrott, speaking for Britain Stronger in Europe, hailed cheaper and more secure food supplies. With a referendum called for 23 June, three of the Tories' 11 Welsh MPs have said they want the UK to leave, while all 25 Welsh Labour MPs want to remain. David Cameron confirmed the date of the vote after negotiating a deal in Brussels which gives the UK the right to restrict EU migrants' benefits and to be excused from taking part in \\"ever-closer union\\". Debating the arguments on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, both Ms Bilney and Ms Parrott claimed the terms of trade would be better under their preferred option. Ms Bilney said the UK would be free to negotiate its own trade deals outside the EU, while the Lib Dem AM said there was a benefit from being part of the world's biggest single market. Ms Parrott also pointed to the EU as a force for peace over 60 years, while Ms Bilney said the UK's membership of Nato, the UN security council and friendship with the USA provided security. Elsewhere, deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told the party's Welsh conference in Llandudno that the UK would remain in the EU but winning the referendum would not be easy. \\"The Tories could end up destroying themselves over Europe but we won't let them destroy our country\\", he said. Monmouth Tory MP David Davies told BBC Wales that he would be \\"campaigning hard\\" for the UK to leave the EU, describing Mr Watson's view as \\"wishful thinking\\". He said the Conservative Party would be united irrespective of the referendum result - but he hoped the result would mean the UK was no longer part of the EU. Mr Davies is one of three of the 11 Welsh Tory MPs who have said they will vote for Britain to leave the EU - former Welsh Secretary David Jones and Brecon and Radnorshire MP Chris Davies are the others. Five have declared in favour of remaining in the EU - Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, Guto Bebb, Byron Davies, Simon Hart and Craig Williams. Three have yet to declare their view - junior Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns, Glyn Davies and James Davies. Plaid Cymru confirmed that the party and its three MPs would be campaigning to stay in the EU. \\"We have to see the big picture,\\" said Euro-MP Jill Evans. \\"There is a lot we would like to change about the EU, but we can only do that from within. The decision we make is about the kind of Wales we want to build and will affect generations to come.\\" Wales is slightly different to the rest of the UK.

Farmers here share in another Â£200m of EU payments a year, which could be lost if the UK opts to leave. However, those who want to leave the EU say it is not \\"European\\" money, but our money. They insist the money could still go to poorer areas of Wales - it would just come from the Welsh government rather than Brussels. However, we have yet to see any concrete plans that the UK government would be willing to send additional money to Wales in the event of Brexit.","completion":"The UK's debate over whether to remain in the European Union continues, with some arguing it brings more secure food supplies and peace, while others claim leaving would allow the UK to negotiate its own trade deals and invest more in public services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose warm air rises from the ground under the cloud happens, how will it affect ice crystals will be smaller. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of warm air rising from the ground under the cloud can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of ice crystal formation and growth, ultimately leading to smaller ice crystals. The process of ice crystal formation and growth in clouds is primarily driven by the temperature of the cloud and the availability of water vapor. In the scenario described, the presence of warm air rising from the ground has potential consequences for both factors that affect ice crystal growth, as outlined below: Direct Effects: 1. Change in cloud temperature: As the warm air rises and comes in contact with the cold cloud, it can potentially increase the temperature of the water droplets and ice crystals within the cloud. This, in turn, might reduce the rate of ice crystal formation as a higher temperature would cause less condensation of water vapor onto the ice crystals. 2. Increased evaporation/sublimation: The presence of warmer air can also lead to an increased rate of evaporation or sublimation of water droplets and ice crystals, respectively. As warm air can hold more moisture, it can cause the tiny water droplets and ice crystals in the cloud to evaporate or sublimate back into water vapor, hindering the growth of ice crystals. Indirect Effects: 1. Alteration of cloud dynamics: The rising warm air can affect the overall dynamics of the cloud by altering its vertical structure and local temperature gradients. This could lead to changes in the cloud's internal circulation and distribution of moisture, possibly reducing the efficiency of ice crystal growth by limiting the availability of water droplets needed for crystal growth. 2. Shortened cloud lifetime: The influx of warm air can have an overall warming effect on the cloud, which can accelerate the cloud's dissipation due to increased convection and mixing with the surrounding environment. A shorter cloud lifetime would mean less time for ice crystal formation and growth to occur. 3. Enhanced melting of ice crystals: If a significant amount of warm air reaches higher altitudes within the cloud, it could lead to the partial or complete melting of ice crystals before they grow to form snowflakes. In this case, the ice crystals would become smaller water droplets again, reducing the likelihood of snowflake formation. In summary, the presence of warm air rising from the ground under a cloud can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation and growth of ice crystals. The warm air can directly impact the cloud's temperature and induce evaporation or sublimation, while also influencing cloud dynamics, lifetime, and ice crystal melting indirectly. These effects can ultimately result in smaller ice crystals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel.

A \\"pay here\\" booth takes credit cards, and displays an autographed photo of Fred \\"The Honzman\\" Honsburger, a right-wing radio talk show host on Pittsburgh's KDKA. Current rates are 20 a minute for two or more people; 10 a minute for solo customers. If there's someone in front of you, you just have to wait in your car. We passed through too early to test out the window (the club was officially closed, though we stepped aside so a customer buying a \\"private dance\\" could enter). The club owner, Nick Climax agreed to speak by phone. \\"We're the first one in world history,\\" says Climax of his drive-thru. It was built in the spring of 2000, and remains the only one that he knows of. The media pounced on the story at the time, and Nick proudly reels off his list of conquests: Jay Leno, Howard Stern, Penthouse, Esquire. The drive-thru became a question in the 20th anniversary edition of Trivial Pursuit. \\"More people listened to my radio interview in Australia in 2000 than listened to the Olympics,\\" Nick tells us. \\" I turned down the cover of Time magazine on October 2, 2000; I didn't want my picture taken.\\" Thinking about the frustration of a line at the drive-thru, we ask Nick, \\"Is there a best time to come?\\" He replies, misinterpreting the question, \\"Any time we're open is good.\\" ||||| They may look like McDonald's drive-thrus, but motorists pulling up to these windows aren't buying hamburgers or french fries. They're buying booze! And it's legal! Hard to believe, but in states like Louisiana and Texas, drive-thru stands specialize in selling daiquiris and other alcoholic drinks to drivers. Inside the drive-thrus are rows of machines that look like they're dispensing slushees. But they're actually pumping out pre-mixed alcoholic concoctions in all flavors like electric lemonade, pina coladas, jungle juice, and margaritas. They even sell shots of liquor. And surprisingly it's all perfectly legal for drivers to purchase these cocktails as long as they don't drink them while behind the wheel. In one weekend in New Orleans, we watched dozens of drivers making daiquiri pit-stops and then driving off sipping their cocktails from a straw. We spotted one couple grabbing afternoon cocktails filled with vodka at a daiquiri drive-thru. We followed the driver and watched him sip the drink while stopped at a red light. After watching him drive erratically at over 70MPH on the freeway, INSIDE EDITION'S Chief Investigative Correspondent, Lisa Guerrero, had a few questions for the driver when he finally reached his destination. \\"Are you comfortable with drinking and driving sir?\\" asked Guerrero. The driver didn't respond. INSIDE EDITION also witnessed another driver who didn't even make it out of the parking lot before he started drinking a daiquiri he ordered with an extra shot of Bacardi. We followed him through one busy intersection after another while he kept sipping his drink. Unbelievably this driver's final destination was a nearby playground. He had a child riding in the back seat the entire time. And even though we heard him order an alcoholic daiquiri, the driver told us it was non-alcoholic. \\"It's a virgin,\\" said the driver. \\"Really,\\" responded Guerrero, \\"you're trying to tell me that's a virgin daiquiri?\\" The driver then got back in his car and prepared to take off. \\"Excuse me,\\" yelled Guerrero at the woman who was putting the child back in the car. \\"Are you sure your child should be in that car? He's been drinking and your putting a child in that car.\\" The owners of these drive-thru bars say they abide by the law and insist they don't encourage people to drink and drive. But that's exactly what we found customers doing. We had a few questions for one of the managers at the daiquiri stands but he wasn't happy to see us. \\"You're serving alcohol to people in their cars. Don't you think this is dangerous?\\" asked Guerrero. \\"It's legal,\\" replied the manager before walking away. We showed our video to Laura Dean-Mooney, the president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. \\"When you allow alcohol to be delivered through a window of a vehicle, you're opening the door for a disaster,\\" said Dean-Mooney. ||||| From strip clubs to funerals, there seems to be a drive-thru available for just about everything in this great, car-obsessed nation. CC BY: Kevin Spencer We Americans sure love our cars — and the convenience of going about our business without ever having to leave the driver's seat. Here, five unusual drive-thru options from around the country: 1. Funerals The Robert L. Adams Mortuary in Compton, Calif., is one of a handful of funeral parlors in the U.S. to offer drive-thru viewings of the dead. \\"You can come by after work, you don't need to deal with parking, you can sign the book outside, and the family knows that you paid your respects,\\" says owner Peggy Scott Adams, as quoted in the Los Angeles Times. \\"It's a convenience thing.\\" 2. Strip clubs The claim to fame of the Climax Gentlemen's Club in Delmont, Pa., was its diamond-shaped drive-thru window. The club, apparently closed since 2009, allowed motorists to pay 10 to view strippers through a small window, without having to leave their cars. \\"Proponents tout the safety and convenience of the drive-thru window,\\" said Gamaliel in a 2000 post at everything2.com. \\"But what about the loss of that lovely strip club ambiance?\\" 3. Prayers The Cathedral of Faith Church of God in Christ in Mount Morris Township, Mich., has held drive-thru prayer services, according to USA Today. Those who heeded signs that read \\"Pull over for Prayer!\\" could fill out a form describing what they wanted to pray about, and then steer over to a minister who would pray with them while their cars idled. \\"Taking the church to the people, to the streets, is what this is all about,\\" says the Rev. Chris Martin. 4. Daiquiris Despite the nationwide crackdown on drunk driving, motorists in states like Louisiana and Texas can still find drive-thru frozen daiquiri chains. And the boozy pit stops are perfectly legal as long as the servers put tape across the straw hole on the lid, and hand you a straw separately. Gallon-sized drinks are available in some locations. For anyone mildly interested in breaking the law, \\"they certainly make things easy,\\" says Tim Murphy at Mother Jones. 5. Liquor... and guns Why stop just for liquor when you can get a gun, too? The Double Shot liquor and gun store in Schulenburg, Texas, has \\"every liquor brand and firearm brand,\\" according to its Yahoo! directory listing. \\"Only in Texas can you buy a bottle of whisky and a gun at the same time,\\" says Rastyrori at the Los Angeles Times — and do it from your car. The store has the \\"convenience of drive-thru so you don't have to get out from behind the wheel while you drink and shoot.\\" |||||","completion":"The Climax Gentleman's Club in Delmont, Pennsylvania was the world's only drive-thru strip club, allowing customers to watch the indoor activity from their vehicles through a diamond-shaped window.

What's the full name of the person that works with Dinah's father? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1905, Dinah Sheldon, an enthusiastic art student, is expelled from Miss Ingram's Seminary for wearing two petticoats instead of five, attending political rallies and insisting that she be allowed to study nudes. When she is sent home to Baltimore, Dinah's understanding father, Dr. Andrew Sheldon, an Episcopalian pastor, easily forgives his headstrong daughter this latest calamity, but her mother Lily encourages her to be more conventionally feminine. Dinah's childhood sweetheart, Tom Wade, also believes that she should settle down and confesses that, since her absence, he has begun dating the more \\"continental\\" Bernice Eckert. Dinah feigns indifference to Bernice, telling Tom that her only ambition is to study art in Paris, and he agrees to help her fulfill her dream. When Dinah is arrested during a brawl in a public park, which starts after four loafers begin arguing over one of her paintings, the overworked Tom is asked to provide bail for all five. Out of gratitude, Dinah offers to write a speech for Tom on equality, which he is scheduled to deliver the next night at the Forum Society's Spring Dance. While preparing the speech, which is a modified version of one of her own debates, Dinah learns that her exit from jail was witnessed by two women, who then relayed the information to Dan Fletcher, Andrew's Scottish vestryman. Dan is upset by the scandal because Andrew has just become a candidate for the new bishop's post, and suggests that he punish Dinah. Instead, the less ambitious Andrew encourages Dinah's dreams by confessing that, as a youth, he had a short career as a ballroom dancer but gave it up to protect his father's reputation. That night, Dinah shows up late at the Forum Society, and Tom is forced to read her speech cold. He is shocked to discover that her \\"equality\\" topic is female emancipation and is laughed at by the large crowd.","completion":"Based on the context provided, the full name of the person that works with Dinah's father, Dr. Andrew Sheldon, is Dan Fletcher. Dan Fletcher is described as Andrew's Scottish vestryman, and he appears to be concerned about the impact of Dinah's actions on Andrew's reputation, particularly as Andrew has just become a candidate for the new bishop's post.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens with a woman walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her. George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved (and eaten), and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and an unexpected visitor that comes up through the sewer access point that she unfortunately decides to open in the basement of her apartment building. Then, through the dangerous investigative efforts of both A.J. and George, the absolute horror is revealed: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is directly involved in the slaughter that has been... Answer:","completion":"\\"Underground Terror: Manhole Monsters\\" Justification: The movie plot involves creatures lurking beneath the streets in the sewers and using manholes to come to the surface to prey on humans. The title \\"Underground Terror: Manhole Monsters\\" directly communicates the horror element of the movie and indicates that the terror is occurring beneath the city, mostly within the sewers. The use of \\"Manhole Monsters\\" gives potential viewers a hint about the nature of the threats in the movie. Additionally, it plays into the traditional alliteration often found in horror and monster movie titles, making it catchy and easy to remember. The term \\"Underground Terror\\" also highlights the unseen and mysterious danger that is at the heart of the film's plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the context: What will Bailey want to do next? Possible answers: go on another date with Carson, break up with their current partner, look for other people to date","completion":"Given the context, it seems most likely that Bailey will want to go on another date with Carson. Their first date was described as going well and having a great time, which suggests that both would be open for the opportunity to explore their connection deeper. This step allows Bailey and Carson to spend more time together, helping to continue building their relationship and understanding each other on a deeper level. The context doesn't suggest that Bailey is currently in a relationship with someone else — the fact that Bailey is dating Carson implies Bachelorhood status. Therefore, the option to \\"break up with their current partner\\" doesn't seem logically applicable in this scenario. Finally, there's no indication in the context given that Bailey is unsatisfied with Carson after their first date. It mentioned they had a great time together. As a result, Bailey looking for other people to date immediately after a successful and enjoyable outing with Carson doesn't resonate with a logical coherence. However, it's important to remember that individual's feelings and future actions can be unpredictable and depend on numerous factors not discussed in this context. While going for another date with Carson seems to be the most viable option based upon the scenario provided, Bailey's ultimate decision would likely be influenced by other personal permutations such as their feelings, their mutual chemistry with Carson, their expectations from a potential relationship, their dating history, and many more complex elements. In summary, the most probable course of action for Bailey after a great first date with Carson would be to go on another date with him. This situation provides room for their relationship to evolve and grow naturally and for them to know each other more.

It generally coincides with the administrative regions of Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Molise, Sicily, and Sardinia. Some also include the most southern and eastern parts of Lazio (Sora, Cassino, Gaeta, Cittaducale and Amatrice districts) within the \\"Mezzogiorno\\", because these territories were also part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The island of Sardinia, although for cultural and historical reasons having less in common with the aforementioned regions, is frequently included as Southern Italy or \\"Mezzogiorno\\", often for statistical and economical purposes. - The Italian Wars, often referred to as the Great Italian Wars or the Great Wars of Italy and sometimes as the HabsburgValois Wars or the Renaissance Wars, were a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, most of the city-states of Italy, the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, most of the major states of Western Europe (France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and Scotland) as well as the Ottoman Empire.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.

Here is an article: Atlanta Skyline (Photo credit: k1ng) In the world of real estate large sums of money are regularly made and lost according to the sage dictum, “location, location, location.” Apparently the same is true with regard to car ownership, as a recent study found as much as a 10,000 difference in operating expenses over a five-year period depending solely on a motorist’s address. Residents of Oregon enjoy the cheapest auto ownership costs – including gasoline, insurance, repairs, taxes and fees – at an average annual 2,204, according to the personal finance website Bankrate.com in New York, NY. Those living in Georgia face the highest annual car costs at an average 4,322. By comparison, the national average stands at 3,201 per year. Why the spread? For starters, Oregonians aren’t assessed a state sales tax to purchase a car, and they’re subject to relatively low insurance rates. What’s more they tend to log 16 percent fewer miles each year behind the wheel than the average U.S. commuter. On the other hand, those living in Atlanta not only suffer the highest state automobile taxes and fees in the nation, they tend to drive far more than the national average, due in large part to Atlanta’s sprawling communities and a dearth of public transportation. The study determined that a driver’s insurance premiums, which are based in part on an insured person’s zipcode (as well as his or her age, sex, driving record, and so on) range from an annual average high of 1,119 among those living in New Jersey to a low of 517 for motorists in North Dakota. The average yearly premium among all states is 762. Annual gasoline costs run from a surprisingly low average of 743 in New York (extensive use of public transportation obviously helps in that regard) to a whopping 1,643 in the Big Sky Country of Wyoming, where an automobile (or perhaps a horse) is the only way to get around. The average U.S. driver pays 1,028 to keep the tank filled. Taxes and fees assessed to motorists can likewise boost a car’s long-term ownership costs substantially and vary wildly from state to state. For example, Oregonians pay an average 157 to their state’s coffers each year for the privilege of owning a car, while Georgians suffer from the highest taxes and registration costs in the nation at 1,952. The national average here is 1,058. Here are the 10 states having the highest typical yearly automobile ownership costs according to Bankrate.com: And for those thinking of riding the rising tide in the real estate market and moving off to an area having a lower cost of living, here are the 10 states that were found to be the cheapest with regard to vehicle ownership: The Fine Print: The above estimates were based on median insurance premiums for 2006 to 2010 provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; average 2012 repair costs compiled by CarMD.com; and state taxes and fees as noted by Kelley Blue Book.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Florida waitress who went the extra mile after a customer left behind 1,000 in cash has been rewarded for her honesty, even though she returned the money to the wrong guy. Pregnant Samantha Knight, of Punta Gorda, found the stash of 100 dollar bills on the seat at one of her tables during her Tuesday night shift at Laishley Crab House. An unusual series of events, including giving the money to the wrong person, ended with her being given the full 1,000 plus an extra 100 tip. Ms Knight initially raced to the front of the restaurant to return the money roll to the customer she thought had left it behind - but she handed it to the wrong guy, and he left with the 1,000. Take the money and run: Surveillance footage at Laishley Crab House shows a waitress handing over 1,000 in lost cash she believed belonged to the man leaving on the right. Mix-up: Waitress Samantha Knight says she thought she was returning it to the right customer, and he acted like the lost money was his. The mix-up happened last Tuesday at Laishley Crab House in Punta Gorda, Florida. 'I was like \\"you left this in the booth.\\" He said \\"thanks,\\" patted his pocket, took it and walked away,' Ms Knight told WBBH. It was only after the man left with the small fortune that the waitress realized she mixed up tables and handed the money to the wrong customer. The man who actually dropped the money, Chuck Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute prior - he soon came back looking for his cash. When told what happened, he was upset and said he'd have let her keep it. He didn't blame her for the confusion, instead blaming the guy who initially took money that wasn't his. 'I felt awful. I still feel madder than anything at that guy,' he told WBBH from back home in Chicago. There's that money I forgot: The man is filmed taking a mint from the restaurant's front desk on his way out when Ms Knight stops him and hands him the money. He easily accepts the wad of 100 dollar bills. Taking the cash: The man even pats his pocket as if the wad of bills fell out. Left too soon: The man the money actually belonged to, Charles Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute before Ms Knight ran to catch the customer. Mr Behm then said that if the money was returned he would give it to the pregnant Ms Knight. After. contacting local television stations, and even having the young. waitress give an on-air interview, the man who took the money realized. it wasn't his and returned it. He said, in an interesting coincidence,. that he also had 1,000 cash in 100 bills on him at the restaurant. After he returned the money, the man, who asked not to be identified, gave the soon-to-be-mother an extra 100 tip 'for her troubles.' When contacted by Ms Knight to say the money was returned, Mr Behm stayed true to his word and told the hard working woman to keep it. 'I called him this morning and let him know,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He said, \\"It's yours to keep.\\"' Honesty does pay off, and Ms Knight's proof is in her purse being 1,100 richer.

The young Dr. Fanshawe(Mark Letheren), an avid archaeologist, is dispatched by his Museum boss to the large country home of Squire Richards(Pip Torrens), where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the Squire. The Squire is surprised by the arrival Fanshawe, he hadn't been expecting him for another week, but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant, Patten (David Burke..of Dr Watson fame), to show him to his room, as Fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task. Patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that Fanshawe's visit will entail, the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking, cleaning and maintenance for him. Fanshawe is a fussy sort, very neat and precise with everything having its place, whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room. Needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work, but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit, so he asks the Squire for a replacement pair, The Squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters, is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house, so he obliges and walks Fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages, there the Squire directs him to points of interest, including Gallows Hill, where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours, his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the Squire describes as a ruin, but Fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn't, he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants? Fanshawe doesn't have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched, he feels a presence, he begins to see moving shadows in the woods, startled he runs home. Over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the Squire, Patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it..The Binoculars! they used to belong to a local man called Baxter, whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from Gallows Hill, boiling them up for some concoction or other, Baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night, the late Squire had acquired his belongings, including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area. These etchings fascinate Fanshawe as they portray the Abbey he seen through his binoculars, but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of Henry VII and so it would be impossible for Baxter to have drawn the sketches, never the less they are signed and dated by Baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power. That night he has horrifically vivid dreams, when he wakes, he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them, what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so? Fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession, as darkness falls the Squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist, they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above Gallows HIll, they quicken their speed, but will they be in time to help or save Fanshawe from his destiny? The Ghost Story for Christmas series of films made by the BBC sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with The Ice House, they were for the most part based on the work of the great M.R. James. In 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and thankfully A View from a Hill also marked a return to the work of James, whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers. Director Luke Watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films, but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great Ghost story, his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax, all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum, thus upping the tension and mystery. The Autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere, the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come. The cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles. The idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see, may even have influenced Álex de la Iglesia in his film La habitación del niño (2006) of the following year, with which it bears striking similarity. I had heard mixed reviews of this particular film, but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers, something that doesn't happen much these days, i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing, which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow. Plenty of time is given, even within its brief 40 minutes running time, for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade.","completion":"After reading the given movie review, I would classify it as a positive review.

Write an article with the title: \\"Microsoft is killing its Android smartphones after just four months\\"","completion":"Title: \\"Microsoft Is Killing Its Android Smartphones After Just Four Months\\" Introduction It is with a heavy heart that we report that Microsoft, the global giant known for its innovations and technological advancements, has decided to prematurely end its venture into the sphere of Android smartphones. Just four months into their journey, the company has declared a halt on the production and development of their fledgling Android devices. Why the Discontinuation? So, why did Microsoft decide to pull the plug so precipitously? The company has been tight-lipped about exact reasons, but industry analysts speculate a combination of factors. These may range from slow sales and reduced market enthusiasm to an attempt to focus on their core business, which is software rather than hardware. Market Performance During the short lifespan of Microsoft's Android smartphones, the market response was tepid. Despite offering a unique user experience, blending Microsoft's usability with Android's customizability, the smartphones could not stand out in a market saturated by established competitors. This factor alone may justify Microsoft's decision, putting its resources into areas with higher potential returns instead of battling giants in a field not its own. Prioritizing Core Business Microsoft's foray into Android smartphones was an ambitious move, but also a departure from its tradition. The company has made its name as a leading software developer, with products like Windows and Office being universally recognized. One theory suggests that Microsoft is reverting to its core business model of delivering innovative software solutions, rather than dividing attention between hardware and software. The Impact on Existing Users Existing users of Microsoft's Android smartphones may feel the sting of disappointment at this news. However, Microsoft has assured its customers that despite the discontinuation, they will continue to provide all necessary support and updates for the current devices. This measure ensures that users are not left stranded and can continue to enjoy their smartphones for as long as they wish to keep them. Conclusion The halt on Microsoft's Android Smartphones is a bold stroke, illustrating how even tech giants need to make strategic decisions to ensure sustainability. Although this news is somewhat disheartening for Microsoft's Android users, it directs us to the real-time unpredictability of the tech industry. Companies often have to make tough calls and reallocate resources where they're best used. For Microsoft, seemingly, that's not in Android smartphones. As usual, Microsoft continues to evolve, seemingly with a refocused emphasis on its foundation - its software. Justification of the Steps: 1. Introduction: I started with a captivating introduction to engage the readers and provide a brief about what the article is going to be about. 2. Why the Discontinuation?: Here, I created a section to contemplate the reasons behind Microsoft's decision. This keeps the readers hooked, answering the primary question the title suggests. 3. Market Performance: This section analyses the performance of Microsoft's Android smartphones in the market, adding validity to the speculated reasons for the discontinuation. 4. Prioritizing Core Business: Here, I reflected on how this decision may be a strategic step for Microsoft as it returns to its primary focus on software. 5. The Impact on Existing Users: It is important to address how this decision could affect existing users, thus, I dedicated a section to discuss this issue. 6. Conclusion: Concluded the article summarizing the main points of the article and ending it on a thoughtful note."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what relaxes, thereby causing aneurysms?\\" is \\"veins and arteries\\", given that aneurysms are caused by relaxation of cell walls of blood vessels? OPT: A. Yes. B. No. Answer:","completion":"Answer: B. No. The term \\"veins and arteries\\" alone does not provide a complete and accurate explanation of what causes aneurysms. It is important to understand the underlying processes that cause a weakening and subsequent relaxation of the blood vessel walls. Aneurysms result from the weakening or relaxation of the blood vessel walls, which can affect both veins and arteries; however, they are more commonly associated with arteries. Aneurysms are caused by a variety of factors, including genetic predispositions, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. Elevated blood pressure and atherosclerosis can damage and weaken the arterial walls, making them more susceptible to bulging and rupturing. Genetic factors, such as inherited connective tissue disorders and family history of aneurysms, can also play a role in the development of weakened blood vessel walls. In summary, while veins and arteries are the blood vessels that can be affected by aneurysms, it is the relaxation or weakening of their cell walls due to various factors that are the direct cause of aneurysms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Danish scientist won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922 for his work on atomic structure and quantum theory?","completion":"The Danish scientist who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922 for his significant contributions to the understanding of atomic structure and quantum theory was Niels Henrik David Bohr. He was born on October 7, 1885, in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was a prominent physicist and philosopher during his time. Niels Bohr made several groundbreaking discoveries during his career, but his most notable achievement was the development of the Bohr atomic model, which remains a cornerstone of modern atomic theory. His model, which he presented in 1913, was one of the first attempts to integrate quantum theory into the description of the behavior and structure of atoms. This was a critical step toward understanding the nature of atoms and their interactions with radiation, opening the door to further advancements in physics and quantum mechanics. Bohr's atomic model proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, fixed paths known as \\"quantum orbits\\" or \\"energy levels,\\" only transitioning between these levels when absorbing or emitting quantized amounts of energy. In other words, only certain discrete changes in energy are permitted for atoms. This was a radical departure from the classical understanding of atomic structure, which assumed that electrons orbited the nucleus in a continuous range of distances and energy levels. Bohr's atomic model was able to accurately explain several atomic phenomena, including the emission spectrum of hydrogen, and helped settle discrepancies between experimental observations and predictions of classical physics. It should be noted, however, that newer atomic models have since improved upon Bohr's original concept, incorporating more sophisticated aspects of quantum mechanics and providing a more comprehensive explanation for atomic behavior. In addition to the Bohr atomic model, Niels Bohr also contributed to the development of quantum mechanics itself. His famous correspondence principle, which states that classical physics should be a limiting case of quantum mechanics, became an important guiding principle for the advancement of the field. Bohr also played a crucial role in the establishment of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, which emphasizes the probabilistic nature of quantum systems and emphasizes that \\"wavefunction collapse\\" occurs when observations are made – essentially marking the boundary between the quantum world and the classical everyday world. Throughout his career, Bohr made significant contributions to the scientific community and greatly influenced the course of theoretical physics. His substantial work on atomic structure and quantum theory not only won him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics but also established him as one of the founding fathers of modern atomic and quantum physics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror literature, film, television, and video games (as a narrative) which relies on the character's fears and/or psychological instability to frighten readers, viewers or players. On a few occasions, Psychological horror overlaps with the psychological thriller subgenre, making whatever story of the genre more unpleasant as well as terrifyingly suspenseful. - The term \\"Cinema of Korea\\" (or \\"Korean cinema\\") encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes. - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres. - Exorcism (from Greek , \\"exorkismos\\" binding by oath) is the religious or spiritual practice of purportedly evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person or an area they are believed to have possessed. Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist, this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate ritual, or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power. The practice is ancient and part of the belief system of many cultures and religions. - South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. - In folklore and parapsychology, a Poltergeist (German for \\"noisy ghost\\") is a type of ghost or other supernatural entity which is responsible for physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects being moved or destroyed. They are purportedly capable of pinching, biting, hitting, and tripping people. Most accounts of poltergeists describe the movement or levitation of objects such as furniture and cutlery, or noises such as knocking on doors. - Precognition (from the Latin \\"præ-\\", \\"before\\" and \\"cognitio\\", \\"acquiring knowledge\\"), also called prescience, future vision, future sight is an alleged psychic ability to see events in the future. - Korean horror is the term given to horror films made as part of the cinema of Korea . Korean horror features many of the same motifs , themes , and imagery as Japanese horror . Korean horror has been around since the early years of Korean cinema ; however , it was not until the late 1990s that the genre began to experience a renewal . Many of the Korean horror films tend to focus on the suffering and the anguish of characters rather than focus on the explicit \`\` blood and guts '' aspect of horror . - Japanese folklorists and historians use \\"ykai\\" as \\"supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants\\". In the Edo period, many artists, such as Toriyama Sekien, created \\"ykai\\" inspired by folklore or their own ideas, and in the present, several \\"ykai\\" created by them (e.g. Kameosa and Amikiri, see below) are wrongly considered as being of legendary origin. - Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. - Shamanism (or ) is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world. - Japanese horror is Japanese horror fiction in popular culture, noted for its unique thematic and conventional treatment of the horror genre in light of western treatments. Japanese horror tends to focus on psychological horror and tension building (suspense), particularly involving ghosts and poltergeists, while many contain themes of folk religion such as: possession, exorcism, shamanism, precognition, and ykai. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

The term most often refers to an audience's perceptions in a dramatic work. Suspense is not exclusive to fiction. It may operate whenever there is a perceived suspended drama or a chain of cause is left in doubt, with tension being a primary emotion felt as part of the situation. - Folk religion, alongside popular religion and vernacular religion, are terms used within religious studies and folkloristics to describe various forms and expressions of religion that are deemed distinct from the official doctrines and practices of organized religion.

Let's break down the elements from the second sentence and compare them to the first sentence to analyze this further: 1. Two friends are walking down the street: The first sentence does mention two girls walking together, but it does not specify if they are friends or not. Likewise, the location of the street is not mentioned. Therefore, this part of the second sentence cannot be confirmed to be true. 2. They are being followed by someone: The first sentence does not provide any information about a third person or any indication that the girls are being followed. The girl with pink streaked hair is looking back, which might suggest that she is aware of someone or something behind them. However, without more context, we cannot definitively conclude that they are being followed. Since this information is not mentioned in the first sentence, it cannot be confirmed true. Considering the above analysis, we cannot label the second sentence as true based solely on the information provided in the first sentence. The original sentence lacks explicit details regarding the girls' relationship, their location, or the presence of a follower.

Movie title: Quadrophenia Context: The film, set in 1964, follows the life of Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels), a young London Mod. Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph and with his beloved Lambretta scooter accidentally destroyed in a crash, Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton.

Answer:","completion":"Quadrophenia is set in the year 1964. The film follows the life of Jimmy Cooper, a young London Mod who is disillusioned with his life and finds solace in the Mod subculture. Jimmy and his friends, fellow Mods, engage in various activities such as partying, taking amphetamines, riding scooters, and brawling with their rivals, the Rockers. The bank holiday weekend brings the Mods and Rockers to Brighton, where a series of running battles ensue. As the rivalry between the two groups escalates, Jimmy becomes romantically involved with Steph, a girl he has a crush on, and participates in a violent altercation against his childhood friend, who is now a Rocker. He eventually gets arrested and is fined a significant sum of money for his involvement in the riots. Upon returning to London, Jimmy's life continues to spiral downwards. His mother throws him out after discovering his stash of pills, he loses his job, and learns that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. Distraught, Jimmy returns to Brighton in an attempt to relive the excitement of his recent past, revisiting the scenes of the riots and his encounter with Steph.

Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, welcomed 3lb son Dax unexpectedly after she went into labor during a four-day holiday in the United States city. Doctors said the child would require treatment until March - which the family's insurance may not cover. But their fears were put to rest on Friday when Manhattan's Lenox Hill hospital released a statement saying they will work with the insurance company to ensure all bills are covered. And a fundraising page set up by friends and family has raised 9,577.68 (£6,248). Scroll down for video Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, welcomed son Dax (together above) unexpectedly after she went into labour 11 weeks early while sightseeing during a New York getaway Miss Amos and son Dax (above), who was born weighing 3lbs, can't fly back to Britain until March, leaving the family stranded with limited supplies. Family and friends are now trying to raise funds for the couple The couple wished everyone a Happy New Year today via Facebook, directly from Dax's hospital bedside 'Lenox Hill Hospital continues to work with the insurance carrier regarding payment approvals for all services rendered by the hospital, anesthesia and physician services from their insurance carrier,' a spokesman said, according to the Guardian. 'We will ensure that there will be no financial impact to the family. 'In addition, our staff has been going above and beyond to ease the overall experience for the family, from arranging a place to live for the duration of their stay to helping them communicate with their family in the UK.' American doctors said the pair's medical bills will reach 200,000 (£130,000), leaving the couple stranded overseas with limited clothes and money. They had set off from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, on December 26 for the short break, but ended up at Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan just two days later. Dax was born within hours of Miss Amos - a fitness instructor - going into labour in New York's Central Park. The couple instantly panicked that their insurance policy may not cover the full cost of their stay, although they confirmed Miss Amos had been told she would be covered to fly to abroad. The pair are encouraging friends and family to help raise funds to help cover their costs while they organise temporary accommodation and the essentials they need. Mr Johnston, a self-employed personal trainer, said: 'He is doing great and so is Katie but we can't return home for up to two to three months.' He added to The Mirror: 'The only problem is we aren't sure if our insurance covers the medical bill. 'We feel quite stranded at the moment, we are stuck here without our family. 'It is scary because we don't know anyone so we are completely on our own. 'We just really want to get home but the main thing is Dax is as safe and as well as possible.' Baby Dax is currently in an incubator and weighs just 3lb but the couple said he is 'making good progress' The pair, who have been together for more than a decade, had planned a 'last holiday' before the baby arrived Miss Amos, a fitness instructor, and Mr Johnston, a personal trainer, fear the insurance firm may not pay out Richard Crow, a friend of Mr Johnston's for more than six years, said Dax's arrival was a big shock. He has now set up a dedicated Facebook page to help raise funds for the family's stay in New York. He told MailOnline: ‘It was such a shock to everyone. The family are all so shocked but so overwhelmed with how everyone is pulling together and how a community can step up and help out. 'Dax is fine, thankfully. He's 11 weeks early but fine. 'It was a bit of a shock, they were walking through Central Park and she got some real bad pains and they had a bit of rest but it got worse and worse and then Lee said “we need to get you to a hospital” and within about an hour-and-a-half he was born.' Mr Crow said Miss Amos had received an epidural at the U.S. hospital, which doctors told them cost in the region of £5,000. He said the couple were worried about their financial situation, having to find food and essentials in America for three months while also paying their rent and bills at home. However, he said they had been put up in temporary accommodation, funded by the Ronald McDonald charity - which provides a free 'home away from home' for families with children in hospital. He said: 'It’s hard enough having a child, especially the first because everything is so daunting, but to then be 11 weeks premature and be 5,000 miles away with no family, friends, or clothes, is really hard. ‘They haven’t got Wi-Fi and the cost of communication is that much that they haven't dared turn their phones on. ‘To then be told you’re not allowed to leave the hospital, is hard. Lee can’t work because he hasn’t got a Visa, so they have got no way of living while they are over there. They’ve also got house and bills to pay here. ‘All I want to do, at a time when their main priority is Dax and caring for him, is take off the pressure on the money front. It would make the experience a hell of a lot better for them.’ IS IT SAFE TO FLY WHILE PREGNANT? SOME AIRLINES BAN EXPECTANT MOTHERS IN THE FINAL FEW WEEKS OF PREGNANCY Most women are safe to travel well into their pregnancy if they take proper precautions, according to government guidelines. The best time to travel is mid-pregnancy, as the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first three months. Some airlines ban pregnant women from flying, but only in the final few weeks of pregnancy when the chance of labour is naturally higher. Travel insurance would normally cover pregnancy-related medical care. Long-haul flights can increase the risk of blood clots, so frequent movement is advised. Miss Amos (left) had an epidural at the U.S. hospital, which doctors said cost in the region of £5,000 Miss Amos gave birth to Dax at Lenox Hill Hospital in the Upper East side of Manhattan on December 28 Miss Amos went into labour during a sightseeing tour in New York's Central Park (pictured). She later gave birth at Lenox Hill Hospital, where Beyoncé gave birth to her daughter and where Lady Gaga was born in 1986 Mr Crow said he had so far raised about £2,150, with more fundraising events, including a community party, lined up in the near future. He said he would be transferring any money to the couple via PayPal and said he expected they would spend it on food, essentials and paying their rent and bills in the UK. He said Mr Johnston had even contemplated flying back to the UK to go back to work to help with costs. He said: 'He said it is an option for him to fly back and work but I think he’s a bit wary of leaving Katie and Dax over there on their own. ‘We’re going to take on to his clients so he still has a business to come back to. ‘Katie’s dad is looking at flying out in February, Lee’s mum and dad are looking the week after next.' Mr Johnston’s father Ray said it was difficult with the family being on the other side of the Atlantic. The couple (above) have been put up in temporary accommodation, funded by the Ronald McDonald charity - which provides a free 'home from home' He told MailOnline: ‘It was a massive shock. It came completely out of the blue. She wasn’t due until March 10. They only went for four days. She got all the certificates for the plane and everything from the doctors, everything was fine. ‘It’s just so far away. We’re happy that Dax is doing really well but we’re very sad we’re not there. It’s very hard on the family, what with the insurance and whether they will be covered. ‘We have no idea how much will be covered, that’s our big worry. The hospital has been absolutely amazing over there, everybody wants to help them. ‘It’s heart-breaking for us not being there but it’s wonderful to see them so fit and healthy. ‘We’re definitely going to go out there, we’re just not sure when yet. It’s very difficult at the moment with lack of contact but Dax is doing really well and that’s the most important thing.’ Mr Johnston also also said it was overwhelming to see the amount of support from the community. He said: ‘Richard is doing all this fundraising and it’s just amazing. Words can’t express how much I want to thank them. ‘It takes your breath away how kind people have been. It’s just amazing.’ Mr Johnston's brother Dean said the birth had been a 'huge shock' and said everyone was rallying around to do as much as possible to help the stranded couple. He said: 'They were taking one last holiday before the baby was born but Dax decided he wasn’t waiting any longer and arrived 11 weeks early. 'He was born on December 28. We got the phone call in the early hours and when they said Katie had had the baby, we went into shock. 'They are all in good health, there were no complications with the birth which was fantastic from a health point of view. Dax is in an incubator but he is breathing on his own. The progress he’s making is really good. 'The current issue that we're facing is that the travel insurance company hasn't agreed to cover anything at the minute. They said they will await a medical report from the hospital to see what they will cover. 'Katie did contact them prior to them leaving and asked if she was covered and they said it was all okay.' He also thanked the community for all those who have helped raise money or donated to the cause. He said: 'The fundraising has been unbelievable overwhelming, to see the love and support we’ve had from friends, family and the general public it’s been truly exceptional. 'We are eternally grateful to everything that everyone is doing.' The Foreign Office confirmed it had been made aware of 'the hospitalisation of a British National in New York' and added: 'We are providing consular assistance.' As part of his fundraising efforts, Mr Crow, 37, who also lives in Burgh-le-Marsh, has now set up a Facebook page to allow members of the public to follow the couple's story and help. The couple left their Lincolnshire home for New York on Boxing Day, for a four-day short break in New York The Dax's Tale of New York page has so far had 3,406 likes and is written by Mr Crow, a gym owner, pretending to be the couple's newborn son. One post said: 'Thank you so much for all your help and your generosity! Mummy and Daddy are still very scared. 'All of my family sincerely thank you all for all your help and donations at at time which allows them to just concentrate on little old me.' Baby Dax is currently at Lenox Hill Hospital, where Beyoncé famously rented out a 1,750 suite when she gave birth to her daughter Blue Ivy in 2012. Joan Rivers, Sarah Jessica Parker and Tine Fey have also all given birth at the hospital, while Lady Gaga was born there in 1986. ||||| A direct message from Lee and Katie. Dear people of the world.

Summarize this article: When it comes to playing spin the bottle, the very first thing you'll need is other people (unless you want to play by yourself, which would be a pretty sad sight). To begin, find a group of willing friends — the more the merrier! Try to get a group that contains people of both genders so that there are a range of many different combinations of people who can potentially kiss. Make sure your friends know what they are getting into before you start playing. Kissing is something that's usually reserved for people who really like each other, so forcing people to kiss who don't want to can be really embarrassing for everyone involved. Don't pressure anyone into playing with you who doesn't want to. When everyone is ready (and willing) to play, arrange yourselves in a circle so that you're all facing inward. Traditionally, this is done on the floor, though there's no reason you can't also do it standing or sitting around a table. Regardless of exactly how you arrange your group in a circle, it's usually best to pick a spot with a tough, hard surface, like a section of hardwood floor. This ensures that the bottle you use can spin well without scuffing or damaging the floor. When you're all ready to play, pick one person to start the game. This person grabs a bottle (or, really, any similarly spin-able object, like a pen, glass, key, etc.) and spins it hard in the middle of the circle of players. After it starts spinning, no one may touch the bottle until it comes to a complete stop. If you're unsure of how to decide who should spin the bottle first, you may want to try letting the oldest or youngest play go first or having one person think of a random number and starting with the person who guesses closest to it. When the bottle comes to a stop, its \\"neck\\" (the end that opens) should be pointing at someone sitting in the circle. The person who spun the bottle has to kiss this person! If you're not using a bottle, designate one end of the object you're using as the pointing end. For instance, if you're using a pen, you might want to use the writing end of the pen as its \\"point\\". If you spin the bottle and it lands on you, spin again. That's really all there is to it! After one person has spun the bottle and given a kiss to the person the bottle ends up pointing at, the person next to him or her in the circle gives the bottle a spin and gives a kiss to the person his or her spin lands on. Play proceeds in one direction — either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Note that sometimes the bottle will end up pointing at the space between two people — in this case, you may want to make the spinner kiss the person that the bottle's point is closest to. Additionally, the bottle may end up pointing at someone that you're not comfortable kissing because of your romantic preferences (for instance, if you're attracted to boys and it lands on a girl). In this case, you may want to kiss the person of the appropriate gender who's closest to the bottle's point. Congratulations! You've learned how to play spin the bottle. This fun and easy game is best enjoyed with a light-hearted attitude from all involved. Don't let things get too romantic or sexual — it's just a game, and one which can become pretty awkward pretty fast if it's taken too seriously. However, if you do feel that telltale \\"spark\\" with someone after playing the game, there's no reason why you shouldn't make a point to get to know him or her after the game! Spin the bottle is great for igniting new connections you might not otherwise have made.","completion":"Spin the bottle is a game in which participants sit in a circle and take turns spinning a bottle or similar object.

First, he went to stage one, where the music was playing in high decibel. Then he went to stage two. There the music was playing in low decibel. He kind of liked the latter one. But I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. What is an answer for this question: Which stage would be louder, stage one or stage two? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background, it can be determined that Stage One was louder than Stage Two. Let's explain this in a detailed way. The decibel scale is logarithmic, which means that every increment represents a multiplication rather than an arithmetic addition. This scale is used to measure the intensity or the amplitude of a sound wave, which are physical properties directly proportional to its perceived volume or loudness. In the context of the music festival that Mark attended, you mentioned that Stage One was playing music at a high decibel level and Stage Two was playing music at a low decibel level. The relative loudness of these two stages would directly depend on their decibel levels. The stage with the higher decibel level would be louder because, as stated in the background, if the sound intensity increases by 10 decibels, the perceived loudness is 10 times greater. This intensity change is not linear but is, in fact, exponential. For instance, a 10-decibel increase in sound intensity results in a tenfold increase in the perceived loudness. A 20-decibel increase will result in a hundredfold (10 x 10) increase in loudness, and a 30-decibel increase results in a thousandfold (10 x 10 x 10) increase. High-decibel sounds can indeed be dangerous. Prolonged exposure to sounds above 85 decibels, such as those common at large music concerts, can cause noise-induced hearing loss. The danger increases with both the decibel level and the duration of exposure. So, using this understanding, since the music at Stage One was defined as having a high decibel level in relation to Stage Two's music, we can infer that the music at Stage One was louder. Therefore, it follows that if Mark preferred the quieter music, he would have favored Stage Two where the music was playing at a lower decibel level. This would have also minimized any potential risk to his hearing. Please note that this explanation assumes the same distance between Mark and the sound source at both stages. The perceived loudness of a sound can also decrease with distance, so if Mark were significantly further away from the source of sound at Stage One compared to Stage Two, the perceived loudness could potentially differ. Nonetheless, with the same distance assumed, it is clear that Stage One is indeed louder than Stage Two as per your scenario description."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Much of Afghanistans livestock was removed from the country by early waves of refugees who fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 2001, the livestock population in Afghanistan had declined by about 40% since 1998. In 2002, this figure was estimated to have declined further to 60%. An FAO survey done in the northern regions in spring 2002 showed that in four provinces (Balkh Province, Jowzjan Province, Sar-e Pol Province, and Faryab Province), there was a loss of about 84% of cattle from 1997 to 2002 and around 80% of sheep and goat. The majority of Afghans traditionally raise sheep instead of goats because goat meat is not popular in Afghanistan. After 2002, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation & Livestock (Afghanistan) with assistance from USAID have been helping to regrow livestock numbers throughout the country. This was done by providing Afghan villagers training and animals to start with. The Council of Ministers (Afghanistan) Mohammad Asef Rahimi stated that over the past decade arable land had increased from 2.1 million hectares to 8.1 million hectares, wheat production from 5.1 million tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes, nurseries from 75,000 hectares to 119,000 hectares and grape production from 364,000 tonnes to 615,000 tonnes. Almond production jumped from 19,000 to 56,000 tonnes and cotton from 20,000 to 45,000 tonnes, with the saffron yield reaching 2,000 kilograms.

Hacking your Xbox: So easy, even a 5-year-old could do it? A San Diego boy has the gaming world's attention after he exposed a security flaw that let him log into his dad's Xbox Live account, without permission, on the family's Xbox One console. \\"I was like ... yeah!\\" young Kristoffer Von Hassel said to KGTV-10, a CNN affiliate. Kristoffer's father, Robert Davies, noticed soon after Christmas that his son was logging into his account and playing games that weren't appropriate for his age. When he asked how, Kristoffer showed him a hack that seems simple in retrospect but is fairly impressive considering a 5-year-old found it. Kristoffer would go to his dad's account and type in an incorrect password. That would take him to a password verifications screen, where he would simply tap the space bar repeatedly and then press \\"enter.\\" \\"How awesome is that?\\" asked Davies, who works in online security himself. \\"Just being 5 years old and being able to find a vulnerability and latch on to that.

Help as much as you can. Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Publicity offers several benefits. There are no costs for message time or space. An ad in prime-time television may cost 250,000 to 5,000,000 or more per minute, whereas a five-minute report on a network newscast would not cost anything. Publicity reaches a mass audience within a short time and new products or company policies are widely known. Credibility about messages is high, because they are reported in independent media. A newspaper review of a movie has more believability than an ad in the same paper, because the reader associates independence with objectivity. Similarly, people are more likely to pay attention to news reports than to ads. For example, Women's Wear Daily has both fashion reports and advertisements. Readers spend time reading the stories, but they skim through the ads. Furthermore, there may be 10 commercials during a half-hour television program or hundreds of ads in a magazine. Feature stories are much fewer in number and stand out clearly. Publicity also has some significant limitations. A firm has little control over messages, their timing, their placement, or their coverage by a given medium. It may issue detailed news releases and find only portions mentioned by the media, and media have the ability to be much more critical than a firm would like. For example, in 1982, Procter & Gamble faced a massive publicity problem over the meaning of its 123-year-old company logo. To fight this negative publicity, the firm had a spokesperson appear on Good Morning America to disprove the rumor . The false rumors were temporarily put to rest. However, in 1985, publicity became so troublemaking that Procter & Gamble decided to remove the logo from its products. Options: A the efficient way of disproving rumors B the importance of a spokesperson C the interaction between firms and media D the negative effect of publicity Answer: D the negative effect of publicity Question:","completion":"What does the example of Procter & Gamble in the article demonstrate about publicity?

Detailed Instructions: Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM. Q: X: coyote, Y: bare A:","completion":"To determine the relationship between \\"coyote\\" and \\"bare\\", I will use the following approach: Step 1: Identify the meanings and semantic classes of X and Y. X (coyote) is an animal, specifically a type of North American wild canine. Y (bare) is an adjective used to describe something that lacks its natural or usual covering. Step 2: Check for HYPER relationship. A HYPER relationship would imply that X is a specific instance of Y. Since \\"coyote\\" is an animal and \\"bare\\" is an adjective describing a state, there is no HYPER relationship between the two words. Step 3: Check for COORD relationship. A COORD relationship occurs when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. In this case, \\"coyote\\" belongs to the semantic class of animals, while \\"bare\\" belongs to the semantic class of adjectives, specifically those describing a state. Since these are different semantic classes, there is no COORD relationship between the two words. Since neither HYPER nor COORD relationships apply to this pair of words: Answer: The relationship between \\"coyote\\" and \\"bare\\" is RANDOM."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over at the Los Angeles Times, Chris Dufresne is skeptical, speculating that the skier could perhaps be \\"an official greeter in a walking cast\\" at the Games, but he goes on to note that you can't really doubt Vonn: She \\"may have movie star looks but she’s also tougher than a 1 steak and one of the most competitive athletes I have ever covered,\\" he writes. That said, the injury is serious: She suffered ACL and MCL tears in her right knee and a break in her shinbone, and will be out for the rest of the season. People reports that, in a statement to the Today show, Vonn said she will have surgeries \\"soon\\" and promised to \\"work as hard as humanly possible to be ready to represent my country next year in Sochi.\\" No word on whether Tiger Woods is by her side. Expand this summary.","completion":"Lindsey Vonn, a renowned American skier, was airlifted from a race yesterday following a major knee injury. Despite the severity of the incident, the US Ski and Snowboard Association remains hopeful that she will recover in time for the 2014 Winter Olympics. In an article published by the Los Angeles Times, Chris Dufresne expresses skepticism about her potential role in the Games, suggesting that Vonn might only be able to serve as an official greeter in a walking cast. Dufresne acknowledges Vonn's reputation for toughness and competitiveness, describing her as \\"tougher than a 1 steak and one of the most competitive athletes I have ever covered.\\" He believes it would be unwise to doubt Vonn's determination to make a comeback. The injury was certainly a significant setback for the skier, as she suffered tears in both her ACL and MCL in her right knee, along with a break in her shinbone. As a result, she will not be able to compete for the remainder of the current season. According to People, Vonn released a statement to the Today show confirming that she will undergo surgeries \\"soon\\" and is committed to \\"work as hard as humanly possible\\" in order to be prepared for representing her country at the Olympics in Sochi next year. As of now, there have been no reports on whether or not professional golfer, Tiger Woods, is by her side during this challenging time. In summary, Lindsey Vonn's recent knee injury has raised concerns and doubts about her ability to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics. While some speculate that she may not be able to participate as an athlete, her toughness and determination should not be overlooked. As the US Ski and Snowboard Association and Vonn herself remain hopeful, she is committed to working hard on her recovery in order to represent her country in Sochi."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who is cleared of all charges? Movie title: Enemy of the State Movie plot: In the 1990s, U.S. National Security Agency official Thomas Bryan Reynolds (Jon Voight) meets with U.S. Congressman Phil Hammersley (R-NY) (Jason Robards) in a public park to discuss support for new counter-terrorism legislation the U.S. Congress is pushing that dramatically expands the surveillance powers of intelligence agencies on individuals and groups. Hammersley remains committed to blocking its passage, since he believes it would almost totally destroy the privacy of American citizens. Reynolds, determined to have the bill pass so as to gain a long-delayed and anticipated promotion, has his team murder Hammersley, spread heart pills over his car, place him in the car and push it in a lake to make it look like he had a heart attack. In the aftermath, they discover too late that wildlife researcher Daniel Zavits (Jason Lee) had a camera aimed in the woods at their location. Zavits inspects the footage and, realizing he has captured the congressman's murder, calls a journalist he knows. The call is monitored by Reynold's team who attempt to break into his apartment to retrieve the tape. Realizing he is in grave danger, he transfers the video to a ZIP disc and places it into an NEC Turbo handheld before fleeing the apartment ahead of Reynolds's men. Zavits is eventually killed when he runs into the street in front of a fire truck but immediately prior, he bumped into an old college friend, labor lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith), and slipped the disc into his shopping bag without his knowledge. When the NSA discovers that Dean might have the video, Reynolds's team raids his house and plants surveillance devices, but the video does not turn up. The NSA then disseminates false evidence to implicate Dean of working with the mob family of Boss Paulie Pintero (Tom Sizemore) and seeing Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet), an ex-girlfriend he had an affair with.

I read this background article the other day: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB?","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be inferred that various life-history features of live-bearing tetrapods are interconnected. Aristotle's theory suggests relationships between adult body mass, brood size, lifespan, gestation period, and fecundity. In the new situation presented, we are given the following information about tetA and tetB: 1. An adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB. 2. A tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. According to Aristotle's theory: 1. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass. Therefore, since tetA is heavier than tetB, tetA will have fewer offspring per brood than tetB. 2. Lifespan increases with gestation period and body mass. Given that tetA has a longer gestation period and is heavier than tetB, it can be inferred that tetA has a longer lifespan than tetB. 3. Fecundity decreases with lifespan. This means that long-lived species, such as tetA, will have fewer offspring in total than short-lived species like tetB. Based on these relationships and the given information about tetA and tetB, we can conclude that tetB would have more offspring in their lifetime than tetA. This conclusion is derived from the fact that tetA has greater body mass, a longer gestation period, and consequently, a longer lifespan. These factors result in tetA having fewer offspring per brood and lower fecundity, leading to fewer total offspring throughout their lifetime as compared to tetB."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The craftsmanship was impeccable, and I could sense the residual energy that had been imbued into the wood. \\"Do you think she's targeting you specifically, or is this just the beginning of something much bigger?\\" I questioned, my curiosity piqued. Saylor shook her head, her dark hair framing her face as she looked up at me with worried eyes. \\"I wish I knew, but whatever it is, we need to be prepared.\\" I nodded in agreement, sliding the box back into her hand. \\"Let's retrace our steps. After your wards gave way, did you feel anything different? Any signs that could help us understand her motives?\\" Saylor thought for a moment before responding. \\"I did feel a sudden heaviness in the air, and a strange, icy-cold sensation washed over me. It seemed like the temperature in the room plummeted for a few seconds, and then everything returned to normal.\\" \\"A sudden drop in temperature could indicate a significant energy shift,\\" I mused, recalling some of the things I had learned from my grandmother, who was skilled in the art of energy manipulation. \\"We should start looking for any unusual occurrences around us. It might give us a clue as to what she's planning.\\" Over the next week, we began to make note of any strange events or odd happenings. We talked to friends and acquaintances, visited local community centers, and scoured the internet for any signs of trouble. Our search led us to a pattern of unexplained incidents – a sudden increase in thefts, mysterious power outages, and a rise in the number of people reporting feelings of unease or paranoia. As we started to piece together the puzzle, it became abundantly clear that something sinister was in the works. Whoever this woman was, she had infiltrated our lives in a way that created a ripple effect, subtly affecting everyone around her and unleashing a chaotic energy that permeated the entire city. As Saylor and I sat in our apartment, poring over the information we had gathered, it seemed for a moment as though we were at a dead end. The woman who had somehow managed to break through Saylor's wards was still a shadowy figure, her intentions unknown. But we knew that we couldn't give up. It was our responsibility to do everything we could to protect ourselves and the people around us from whatever plan she had set into motion. So, taking a deep breath, we delved further into the world of energy manipulation and protective charms, determined to learn all we could about how to strengthen our defenses. We attended workshops and seminars, consulted with experts, and even sought the guidance of our ancestors, who had dealt with similar threats in the distant past. As the weeks passed, we grew stronger and more knowledgeable. Our resolve to stop this woman and restore balance to our city only grew more steadfast. And as we continued on our journey, we also discovered an inner strength we would need to face the trials that still lay ahead. It was only a matter of time before we would come face to face with the person responsible for the unraveling chaos around us. But with our newfound knowledge and powerful determination, we were ready for whatever challenges lay ahead of us, and we were prepared to defend our home and our community, no matter the cost."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool?, using the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., what would be the answer ?","completion":"Based on the information given in the article, the answer to the question \\"Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool?\\" cannot be definitively determined, as it is not specifically mentioned.

The firm said hackers accessed at most 1.2 million email addresses, names and phone numbers and 21,000 unique bank account numbers and sort codes. It said the scaling down did not lessen the seriousness of the incident. Police have made a second arrest, a 16-year-old boy from west London, in connection with the investigation into an alleged data theft from TalkTalk. He was held on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, and later bailed, after detectives searched an address in Feltham, Scotland Yard said. On Monday, a 15-year-old boy was arrested and bailed in Northern Ireland in connection with the hacking. The Metropolitan Police said officers had searched a residential address in Liverpool. In an update on its website, TalkTalk also said hackers had accessed a maximum of 28,000 obscured credit and debit card details, with the middle six digits removed, and 15,000 customer dates of birth. The phone and broadband provider, which has more than four million UK customers, said it would be writing to all affected customers to let them know what information had been accessed. It said that any stolen credit or debit card details were incomplete - and therefore could not be used for financial transactions - but advised customers to remain vigilant against fraud. TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding said the scale of attack was \\"much smaller than we originally suspected\\", but that did not detract from the seriousness of the incident. \\"We know that we need to work hard to earn back your trust and everyone here is committed to doing that,\\" she said. The TalkTalk website was hit by a \\"significant\\" cyber-attack last week. MPs will launch an inquiry into the attack, with culture minister Ed Vaizey saying the government is not against compulsory encryption for firms holding customer data.","completion":"TalkTalk has revealed that hackers accessed 1.2 million email addresses, names and phone numbers, along with 21,000 unique bank account numbers and sort codes, resulting in the arrest of two teens so far."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Article: Over the holidays, I took my three young children into a fancy chocolate shop to buy gifts. Halfway home, I noticed my 7-year-old son playing with a plastic noisemaker. Long story short: He had stolen the toy. I kept my cool -- even when he said, \\"but it was only 1.50, Mom!\\" --and explained why it was unacceptable to take things we didn't buy. A few hours later, I marched my son back to the store with two dollars from his piggy bank. He walked embarrassedly to the counter and told the clerk that he had taken something without paying for it, that he was sorry to break it and that he would pay for it now. I know exactly how terrible he was feeling. Returning to the scene of the crime is the same shame-causing punishment I received when I was five and stole something from a store. 1 remember my dad sending me back to return the item. It remains one of my clearest child- hood memories. After that day, I never stole again. My dad taught me such an important lesson 30 years ago and I saw an opportunity to do the same for my son. But now I wonder if it was the fight thing to do. \\"Returning to the store is absolutely the right thing to do,\\" Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist and author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids, says. \\"Many children steal -- they' re not born knowing the rules so it' s our job to teach them.\\" And stay calm when you set them. \\"If you overreact or yell, you might create a fascination with the behavior and a willful child will be more likely to fight against you,\\" she says. Having a child physically return the stolen item helps him or her grasp the situation -- and the consequence. But don't talk about it for too long. \\"lf you continuously bring up the incident, the child will believe they' re a thief and that they' re bad,\\" she says. Only time will tell if this experience will have the same powerful effect on my son as it had on me, but at the same time I can rest if I haven' t dealt with the situation badly. Question: When the author' s son was caught playing with a stolen toy, he _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"didn't think it was a big deal\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"didn't think it was a big deal.\\" When the author's son was caught playing with the stolen toy, he initially tried to downplay the situation by saying, \\"but it was only 1.50, Mom!\\" This response suggests that he didn't think it was a big deal or a significant problem. However, the author used the opportunity to teach their son an important lesson about stealing and its consequences. The fact that the son was made to return the stolen item to the store and apologize for his actions helps him understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of abiding by societal rules and norms. Additionally, according to Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist, intervening in such a situation is crucial to developing a child's understanding of right from wrong. Parents should remain calm and composed while handling the situation to prevent the child from becoming more fascinated by or defiant against the behavior. It's important not to overemphasize the incident or continuously bring it up to avoid the child developing a negative self-image or believing they are inherently bad. In the end, only time will tell if this experience has the same powerful, transformative effect on the author's son as it had on the author themselves. But by taking the appropriate steps to address the situation and communicate the importance of respecting property and ownership, the author can feel confident they didn't handle the situation badly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: \\"How can this be put into practice?\\" Context: \\"The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart. In this paper McTaggart proposes two \\"temporal series\\". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, simpliciter and in comparison to each other. The B-series eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In order to put McTaggart's concepts of the A-series and B-series into practice, we need to first understand the theoretical framework and then explore practical applications in various fields. Here, we will discuss a few steps to implement these ideas: 1. Deepen the understanding of A-series and B-series: The first step towards implementing these concepts is to gain a thorough understanding of the differences between the two temporal series. The A-series is based on the notion of temporal becoming, where events are categorized as past, present, or future. On the other hand, the B-series removes the reference to present and focuses solely on the relations of 'earlier than' and 'later than' among events. 2. Identify relevant domains: It is essential to identify domains in which the concepts of the A-series and B-series can be practically applied. Some potential fields include philosophy, physics, cognitive science, and psychology. 3. Apply the concepts in philosophy and metaphysics: Explore how McTaggart's concepts of A-series and B-series can be used to understand issues in metaphysics such as time travel, the nature of time, and the problem of change. It is important to consider the implications and consequences of these concepts when applied to specific philosophical debates, such as eternalism, presentism, and the growing block view of time. 4. Apply the concepts in physics: In the field of physics, researchers can study the role of A-series and B-series concepts in understanding the nature of time and its relation to space or spacetime. This may involve using these concepts to analyze different physical theories, such as the general theory of relativity, and examining the implications on our understanding of the progression of time. 5. Apply the concepts in cognitive science: Investigate the ways in which the A-series and B-series concepts can be used to gain insight into human cognition and perceptions of time. This could involve studying how the concepts may play a role in the mental representation of time, the encoding and retrieval of time-related information in memory, and how individuals perceive durations and temporal order. 6. Apply the concepts in psychology: In psychology, explore the role of A-series and B-series concepts in the human experience of time. Investigate the psychological effects of focusing on temporal becoming (A-series) versus focusing on the relations between events (B-series). Examine how such temporal perspectives might influence emotions, decision-making, and behavior. 7. Develop tools and methods: As the concepts are applied to various disciplines, it is crucial to develop tools and methods that can help practitioners effectively incorporate the A-series and B-series into their research and practice. This may involve creating models, simulations, or analytical frameworks to better understand and implement these concepts. 8. Continuous assessment and integration: Finally, it is vital to continuously assess the impact and effectiveness of applying the A-series and B-series concepts in various fields. Researchers and practitioners should collaborate to refine and integrate the theories, share their findings, and encourage interdisciplinary approaches that can uncover new insights into the nature of time and its implications. By following these steps and engaging in multidisciplinary collaboration, the concepts of A-series and B-series can be effectively put into practice, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the nature of time and its implications on our lives and the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fruit from the new Meat Trees, developed by British scientists using the gene technology, is closely like ordinary grape-fruit. But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef! \\"Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,\\" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. \\"Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too.\\" Although it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. \\"We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,\\" Dr. Vincent says. \\"When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell.\\" Those who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. \\"I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,\\" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. \\"But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all.\\" Meat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the drink made from sorghum and urwagwa in the cuisine that is based on local staple foods? ? The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas.

Step 2: Research Tycho Brahe's Mars observation Tycho Brahe, a Danish astronomer, is known for his meticulous and accurate astronomical observations. Although he did not \\"discover\\" Mars, as it was already known to the naked eye since ancient times, he made significant and detailed observations of the planet's position and movement in the late 16th century. These observations helped refine the understanding of Mars' orbit and laid the foundation for later researchers like Kepler to develop better models of planetary motion. Step 3: Identify the location of Tycho Brahe's Mars observation Tycho Brahe made most of his observations at his observatory, Uraniborg, on the island of Hven, which is located between Denmark and Sweden.

I've certainly noticed some pupils being feverishly overgenerous of late. Last year, I received not one bottle of wine but four for helping a disaffected pupil through his GCSEs. By and large, my colleagues report the gifts differing along gender lines. Gentlemen get ties, mugs, booze and, if they're really lucky, tickets to football matches. The ladies are often presented with flowers, jewels, chocolates and so on. When my son was at private school, I noticed there was a real competitiveness between the students about giving presents to teachers, with expensive baskets from fancy stores and huge bouquets being handed out on the last days of term. Since my wife and I only let my son give thank-you cards, it was clear we were not \\"classy\\". Now he is at an inner-city primary, we've noticed that this kind of _ seems to have more or less disappeared. For one thing, there isn't that kind of money floating around - but there isn't that kind of competitive culture either. Personally, I think gifts to teachers should be banned beyond the thank-you card: they cause many more problems than they solve, creating insecurity in both parents and staff. Perhaps the recession and the lack of money in people's pockets might be a good excuse for the government to issue some guidelines to schools that gifts shouldn't be accepted by teachers.

After a short while, four prisoners suddenly get up, congregate across the room, and worshipfully prostrate themselves before a well dressed, bespectacled man (John Lone).

(CNN) -- Israel's security can only be assured when its neighbors believe that it is no longer oppressing the Palestinian people but instead living in peace and harmony with them. The de facto strategy of past and present Israeli governments of seeking security through domination and by pushing Palestinians out of their homes, or allowing right-wing religious fanatics to create settlements throughout the West Bank to ensure that no Palestinian state could have contiguous parts, has not and cannot work to provide safety for Israel. Israel's fate and its well-being are intrinsically linked to the well-being of the Palestinian people. It's time for the powerful to show generosity to the relatively powerless. A similar path would make the","completion":"most sense for other conflict-ridden nations and regions around the world, as true security and stability can only be achieved through mutual understanding, cooperation, and a genuine desire to address the needs and grievances of all parties involved. Building trust and rapport among various factions within a society, rather than exacerbating division, is crucial in fostering a lasting peace that benefits all. For example, the long-standing tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir have given rise to numerous armed conflicts and continued unrest over the years. Both nations could prioritize diplomatic efforts, such as initiating comprehensive dialogues that address key issues, including demilitarization, economic cooperation, and cultural exchanges. By doing so, they might foster an environment that would enable a peaceful and mutually beneficial resolution to the conflict. Similarly, the ongoing crisis in Syria, which has led to immense suffering and displacement of millions of individuals, necessitates a multifaceted approach that addresses both the immediate humanitarian concerns and the underlying political and economic factors feeding the conflict. This could entail establishing formal channels for open negotiations among the opposing factions, providing assistance for the reconstruction of devastated communities, and creating opportunities for Syrians to participate in the rebuilding of their nation. Countries dealing with internal strife, such as Yemen or South Sudan, could also benefit from working towards equitable and inclusive governance systems that ensure the representation of various ethnic, religious, and political groups. This would require the establishment of dialogues, power-sharing agreements, and measures that strengthen the rule of law and protect human rights. By building bridges instead of walls, these nations could foster reconciliation and pave the way for peace and prosperity. Furthermore, in cases where external forces have a significant influence on the conflict, such as the United States in Afghanistan or Russia in Ukraine, it is essential for these powers not to exacerbate tensions but rather to take on a more constructive role in the peace process. This may involve promoting diplomatic channels and regional cooperation, as well as providing support for rebuilding infrastructure, ensuring the safety and security of local populations, and fostering economic development. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage would be to assert that adopting a similar approach as proposed for Israel – prioritizing peace, mutual understanding, and respect for the rights and dignity of all parties involved – can contribute to resolving conflicts more effectively and sustainably than attempts to dominate or marginalize opposing factions. By recognizing that the fate and well-being of all communities involved in these disputes are intrinsically linked, nations and powerful entities across the world can work collectively toward creating a more just, equitable, and secure global order."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: First of all, you must stop whatever are you doing in that moment and sit down; after a few minutes of rest, the cramps should decrease in intensity or even disappear. If the pain lasts longer or they are really intense, call your doctor and tell him or her about your symptoms because it might be a more serious problem. Sometimes it helps to lean a little bit to the side that hurts; this way, you can relax the muscles in that area and reduce the pain you feel. To relieve a cramp in your leg, lie on your back momentarily and then extend the affected leg while keeping the knee straight. Try to position yourself so that the foot is bent backwards until the pain is gone. Another means of stretching the legs is by riding a stationary bike for 30 minutes daily. Brisk walking is also a way of improving circulation in the lower extremities. You might be tempted to use some medication for treating the pain; it is very important to know that many of the drugs used today, unfortunately, may have severe adverse or teratogenic effects (they can lead to congenital malformations or other abnormalities). Because of this, it is important to check with your doctor before using any over-the-counter medications. Consider taking acetaminophen (the brand name is Tylenol) because it is considered a safe drug to take during pregnancy. The recommended dosage is 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours (unless stated otherwise by your physician). Another frequently used drug for pain relief is ibuprofen (Nurofen and other trademarks); this must be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester because it promotes premature closure of a fetal structure called ductus arteriosus (DA). You might try to reduce the pain by applying a warm compress to the area where you are experiencing cramps. However, be careful not to keep it against your skin for too long as it may cause nerve damage to your skin. Once you begin to feel relief, remove the warm compress. You can apply the warm compress to the area again if the cramps come back. You can also consider taking a warm bath rather than using a warm compress. The heat will have a soothing effect on your muscles, which can help to calm cramps that you have.

Here's a possible sequence of events that could occur due to this perturbation: 1. Larger, deeper breaths can increase the amount of oxygen inhaled, which may then increase blood oxygen levels. 2. Increased oxygen levels in the blood can improve the efficiency of the immune system and aid in the production of immune cells. 3. A stronger immune response may help the body detect and combat the bacterial infection more quickly and effectively, potentially reducing the severity of the disease. 4.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What group did the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts contribute to their album? , can you please find it? After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Salt Lake City Airport for the following movie plot: Columbia Air Lines' Flight 409 is a Boeing 747-100 on a red-eye route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's boyfriend, even though their relationship was \\"on the rocks\\" at that time. Patroni and Murdock take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake. En route, they communicate with Pryor, learning that the autopilot is keeping the aircraft in level flight, but it is inoperable for turns.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals? , can you please find it? John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833.

Question 2: Stephanie McMahon-Given that you have a big TV role in today's WWE as a major main event heel, how much of a say do you have in creative decisions? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are two distinct questions, addressing separate aspects related to two notable wrestling figures, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Let me provide a detailed answer for each question. Question 1: What is the history of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's relationship? The relationship between Triple H (born Paul Levesque) and Stephanie McMahon (born Stephanie Marie McMahon) stretches back over two decades. Their journey started as a scripted romantic storyline in WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) and has grown into an authentic lifelong partnership both personally and professionally. The roots of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's relationship can be traced back to the late 1990s within the WWE. In 1999, a storyline commenced where Triple H and Stephanie McMahon became an on-screen couple. This included the infamous \\"Vegas Wedding\\" angle in which Triple H drugged and married a seemingly unconscious Stephanie McMahon as part of a rivalry with her father, Vince McMahon. As they continued working together, their on-screen chemistry evolved into a real-life romance. By 2000, the pair had become an influential couple within WWE, joining forces to create the villainous faction known as \\"The McMahon-Helmsley Era.\\" This on-screen partnership continued until 2002 when they \\"divorced\\" as part of the storyline. Despite their on-screen separation, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's real-life relationship continued to flourish. They got engaged in 2003 and were married on October 25, 2003, becoming a power couple both in and out of the ring. Throughout the years, they have supported each other's careers, with Triple H becoming an executive vice president, while Stephanie has risen through the ranks to become the current WWE Chief Brand Officer. They also have an impressive in-ring legacy, with numerous championship belts and accomplishments between them. Beyond the wrestling world, the couple has three daughters and actively participates in various philanthropic and charity ventures. Question 2: Stephanie McMahon-Given that you have a big TV role in today's WWE as a major main event heel, how much of a say do you have in creative decisions? Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, has held numerous executive positions within the company over the years and has been an influential figure in WWE creative decisions. Currently, Stephanie McMahon serves as the WWE Chief Brand Officer, focusing primarily on elevating the brand's image, expanding the company's global reach, and developing strategic partnerships. However, it's essential to recognize that the WWE creative process involves multiple individuals and layers of approval. Although Stephanie plays an on-screen character and carries significant influence as a member of the McMahon family, she doesn't solely dictate the creative content of WWE programming. Instead, the WWE creative team, consisting of writers and producers, develops the creative direction for WWE storylines and character arcs. Ideas usually flow through a chain of command, with input from several individuals, including Stephanie McMahon, Triple H, and ultimately, Vince McMahon, who has the final say in most creative decisions. Despite her primary focus as the Chief Brand Officer and not directly overseeing the creative team, it's clear that Stephanie McMahon, with her deep-rooted connection to the business and on-screen role, would likely have some input and say in creative decisions. Her experience as a performer and WWE executive makes her a valuable resource in offering suggestions and helping to shape the overall direction of storylines and character development."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"The legislature is seated at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the statement \\"The legislature is seated at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee\\" is not a reasonable answer to your question. This statement merely reveals where the Florida legislature meets, but does not furnish any information about how often it is in session. A more suitable answer to your question is as follows: The frequency of the Florida Legislature's sessions is regulated by the state constitution. Regular sessions commence on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March and last 60 calendar days, which are consecutive unless otherwise provided by law. This means that the Florida Legislature is in session for a total of 60 days every year in a regular session. However, it's important to note that special sessions called by the governor or decided upon by the leadership of both houses may occur. These special sessions can take place at any time of the year and typically address urgent legislative issues that cannot wait until the next regular session. They cannot exceed 20 days, unless extended by a three-fifths vote of each house. Furthermore, the legislature also participates in committee weeks for several months before the regular session. During these committee weeks, legislators meet to discuss, write and pass bills that are then formally introduced during the regular session. These committee weeks typically start in September or October and end when the regular session begins in March. Despite meeting formally for a short period each year, the specific work of the Florida legislature is ongoing throughout the year as they prepare bills, conduct research, analyze budgets, engage with constituents, and participate in interim committee meetings. So, to summarize, while the formal legislative session in Florida happens for 60 consecutive calendar days starting in March each year, the work of the legislature is continuous throughout the year with possible special sessions and committee weeks preceding the regular session."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Logan had to remind Benjamin to take the medicine because","completion":"Benjamin was quite forgetful when it came to his daily routines, especially with something as important as his prescription medications. It wasn't out of sheer negligence, but rather a combination of his busy schedule, numerous responsibilities, and admittedly a bit of absent-mindedness. Logan and Benjamin had been friends since their early years, forging a strong bond like brothers. As they grew older, they continued to support one another through thick and thin. This bond only strengthened when Benjamin fell ill, necessitating a strict medication schedule to keep his condition in check. Logan took it upon himself to be his friend's caretaker and staunch advocate in this trying phase of his life. A sense of protectiveness enveloped Logan, and he was determined to never miss a dose. Consequently, he developed a system to remind Benjamin about the medication he needed. The two would coexist in harmony, with Logan's constant supervision ensuring that Benjamin's well-being was taken care of. Logan's method began with an established morning ritual. Before they would part ways for their respective jobs, he would emphasize to Benjamin the importance of taking his medicine. He would frame these reminders in a light-hearted yet firm manner, knowing that scolding or disappointed tones wouldn't be helpful. This exchange became the centerpiece of their daily interactions, as it was an essential task that Logan hoped would eventually become second nature for Benjamin. Digital reminders also played an important role in Logan's strategy. He would use text messages, phone alarms, and even calendar notifications to ensure Benjamin stayed on track. These digital nudges complimented the habitual morning conversation the duo shared. Over time, Logan realized that it wasn't just the reminders that were crucial, but also creating opportunities for Benjamin to share any apprehensions or concerns about his diagnosis and medications. He gave Benjamin room to express his fears and frustrations when needed, fostering understanding and camaraderie between the two. Logan emphasized the importance of organization when it came to storing Benjamin's medications. A pillbox organizer was purchased, where morning and evening doses were separated and stored in a chronological manner. This way, Benjamin had an easy time remembering which medicine he had taken and which were still pending. In spite of his best efforts, Logan acknowledged that setbacks could still occur. He made sure that an open line of communication existed between the two friends, so that whenever an issue arose, it could be tackled on the spot. He reiterated to Benjamin that missing a single dose wasn't the end of the world, but it was important to strive for consistency. As Logan continued to remind Benjamin to take his medicine, he saw a gradual transformation in his friend's self-discipline. Over time, Benjamin grew more in tune with his body and health, which in turn helped him become more proactive about his condition. The unwavering dedication Logan demonstrated in reminding Benjamin about his medications turned into a pivotal element of their bond. It became a testament to their friendship, proving that through solidarity and compassion, loving friends could endure and conquer life's countless obstacles together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The dining table could become a relic of. the past as nearly a third of Britons now confess to eating there only a. few times a year. New research suggests that the number of us who now eat at our dining or kitchen table is shockingly low. Just five per cent of those polled ate every meal at the table, compared with 13 per cent of those who ate at least one meal a day there. The traditional scene of a family sitting to enjoy a meal together may become a thing of the past, as a third only use their table a few times a year. Almost a fifth of respondents (19 per cent) said that they ate one or two meals a week at the dining or kitchen table. Over a quarter, 26 per cent, of those surveyed confessed to eating at the table no less than once or twice a month and nearly a third (30 per cent) admitted to using it just a few times a year. Only four per cent said they never ate any meals at the table whilst three per cent said they didn’t even own one. Sitting down to meals has been replaced by eating on the go to keep up with fast paced modern lifestyles. A spokesperson from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research commented: ‘Compared to 40 years ago, we now live in a society which moves at an extremely fast pace. Often, breakfast has to be eaten on the go, and in many cases so does lunch. 1. Every meal - 5%. 2. At least one meal a day - 13%. 3. At least once or twice a week - 19%. 4. At least once or twice a month - 26%. 5. A few times a year - 30%. 6. Never - 4%. 7. Don’t have a dining/kitchen table - 3%. ‘Also, with people working longer hours, a quick ready meal or a takeaway in front of the TV is the easiest option.’ One woman said: ‘I always make sure my children eat at the dining table, but once you’ve got home from work, fed them and put them to bed, it’s all you can do to crash out in front of the TV with a jacket potato. ‘I can remember always having meals at the table, but then again my mum was a homemaker and had the time to prepare everything.’ Another man commented: ‘I hardly ever eat at the table, I think the only times I do are at Christmas and Easter. ‘In fact the only table I regularly eat at is my desk in the office when I am having my lunch.’ One final respondent said of the poll: ‘I am really worried that my children are growing up in a society where eating meals at the table is something special and not the norm. ‘What does it say about family life in this country if all we can do at meal times is sit and watch the television while stuffing our faces.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the decline of eating meals at dining tables among Britons, with a third admitting to using the table only a few times a year.

The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Retired solicitor Donald Lock was stabbed 39 times on the A24 at Findon, West Sussex, last July. Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted killing Mr Lock, claiming diminished responsibility. In an video played at Lewes Crown Court he told police he saw Mr Lock in his rear view mirror looking \\"very angry\\". \\"I just saw someone very close and very angry and I wanted that scenario to stop because it was intrusive,\\" said Mr Daley. \\"It was aggressive. I know some people drive close sometimes but this person was very, very close and I didn't know why. \\"I thought he would see my red lights and think maybe he shouldn't be driving so close to me, because that's not how people are supposed to drive.\\" The pensioner's widow, Maureen Lock, left the courtroom when Mr Daley showed police during the interview how he had stabbed her husband. Mr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of the defendant's Ford Fusion in July and then asked why he had braked so abruptly. Mr Daley continued: \\"I'm not happy that the man has died. I'm not happy that in the final minutes of his life he was in that much pain, and I don't want to be reminded of it. \\"I feel very sorry about what I have done and I don't want to see anything like that happen in my lifetime again.\\" When he was asked why he did not stop stabbing Mr Lock after he fell to the ground, he replied: \\"It's as if his anger has been put on to me and I'm trying to get rid of it.\\" When asked why he had to use a knife, Mr Daley said it was \\"in his mind to protect himself\\". He also said he had stopped taking medication to help him sleep a year before the attack. During the interview he said he had recently split up from his girlfriend but was \\"making efforts to win her back\\". Jurors have been told Mr Daley had suffered from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had \\"pleaded\\" with mental health experts to have him sectioned. Defence counsel David Howker QC told the court he would not be calling Mr Daley to give evidence, but added: \\"There is other evidence to call.\\" The court heard Mr Daley saw consultant forensic psychiatrist Jake Harvey the day after the killing and told him he felt he had been getting less help with his mental health, was being seen by \\"too many trainee nurses\\", and had not been taking an anti-psychotic drug he had previously been prescribed. He described hearing \\"so many juvenile voices running through my head\\" which he said were \\"angry\\" and \\"overwhelming\\", jurors heard.

He said his primary diagnosis was paranoid schizophrenia and exaggerated autistic traits.

Large Internet companies such as Google and Microsoft have thousands of computers.As these computers deal with information,they produce lots of heat,so they need huge cooling systems .These systems send the heat in to the air. A company in Holland thinks paying to make the computers work and then paying again to cool them are a waste of energy.So the company developed a special device-thee-Radiator. Boaz Leupe,head of the company,says that e-Radiator works as a heating system and saves money.He explains that the energy is used twice-once to heat the home and once to cool the computer and that the users don't have to pay to cool their computers.

Article: When I was about eight years old, I decided that I wanted to be a famous film star when I grew up. Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals and pour thick flour over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios _ . - spend a lot money on computers - use a lot of common sound in films - use computers for everyday sounds - give Foley artists a lot of new ideas Answer:","completion":"Most modern studios use computers for everyday sounds. The article explains that in the past, creating \\"everyday\\" sounds was labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring a Foley artist's expertise and imagination to replicate these noises. However, with technological advancements, these sounds are now readily available and generated through computer software. This shift in method not only alleviates the pressure on Foley artists but also allows them to dedicate more of their time to creating unusual sound effects.

Some of the rumored plastic surgery procedures that Bridget Marquardt is believed to have undergone include: 1. Breast augmentation: It was rumored that Marquardt had breast implants early in her career, supposedly increasing her breasts size. 2. Rhinoplasty (nose job): Some people speculated that she had her nose refined, as there seems to be a difference in the shape of her nose in later pictures compared to earlier ones. 3. Botox injections: It is assumed that Marquardt might have had Botox injections to maintain her youthful appearance, which leads to the reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. 4. Lip fillers: Observers of Marquardt's transformation have also suggested that she may have had her lips subtly enhanced using lip fillers, resulting in fuller and more defined lips. As for the second question about getting plastic surgery in Korea, it is a personal choice heavily dependent on individual preferences, values, and circumstances. South Korea is well-known for its high-quality plastic surgery clinics, skilled surgeons, and advanced techniques. However, before making a decision, there are few things you should consider: 1. Research: Thoroughly research the specific surgery or procedure you want to undergo, possible complications, and expected outcomes. 2. Choose the right clinic and surgeon: Take the time to choose an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon and a reputable clinic to attain the best possible results. 3. Cost: Plastic surgery can be expensive, and the costs can vary depending on the procedure and the clinic you select. Consider whether you can afford the procedure and if it is worth the investment. 4. Recovery time: Some procedures require an extensive recovery period that could interfere with your work, personal life, or travel plans. Ensure you have the time and support necessary for a smooth recovery. 5. Psychological impact: Plastic surgery can have profound emotional and mental effects on individuals. Be aware of these potential consequences and ensure that you have the proper support to deal with them.

Just throwing everything into a bowl simultaneously could lead to uneven distribution, resulting in a less-than-ideal final product. It's recommended to whisk these dry ingredients together well before starting to incorporate your wet ingredients. So, your completed process would look like this: 1. Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. 2. Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter. 3. Mix until smooth. 4. Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high. 5. Pour batter onto the griddle.

Given the question: What is the last name of the person whose tenure in in Mühlhausen was from 1706 to 1708? Answer the above question based on the context below: Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

Title: Monster from Green Hell Movie plot: In preparation for sending a manned rocket into space, American scientists Dr. Quent Brady and Dan Morgan are put in charge of a program that sends various animals and insects into space to test their survival rates. After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz' African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell. Several months later, Brady reads a newspaper account of turmoil in Central Africa caused by gigantic monsters and surmises that the wasps in the missing rocket were exposed to huge amounts of cosmic radiation because an earlier, minimal overexposure had resulted in the birth of a spider crab twice the size of its mother. Brady and Morgan request a leave of absence from Washington and head for Africa to investigate. In Libreville, equatorial Africa, the territorial agent makes plans for them to travel to meet Dr. Lorentz. Once the safari is ready, Mahri, an Arab, leads Brady and Morgan on the four-hundred mile trek to Lorentz' hospital. The safari battles brush fires, fever, drought and storms, eventually reaching the Lorentz compound where Lorna informs them that her father has not returned from a journey to Green Hell. Later, Arobi arrives with the news that Lorentz has been killed by a monster living in the cauldron of a volcano and gives Brady a giant stinger he removed from the doctor's shoulder.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mortgage delinquency rate declines, but is still high Some 5.78% of the nation's mortgage holders were behind on their payments 60 days or more in the January-to-March quarter, credit reporting agency TransUnion said Wednesday. That's down from 6.19% in the period last year, and below the 6.01% delinquency rate for the last three months of 2011. The decline in the U.S. mortgage delinquency rate follows two quarters of increases. But barring any severe shocks to the U.S. economy, the rate is expected to continue easing, says Tim Martin, group vice president of U.S. Housing for TransUnion. \\"We had a couple quarters where it ticked up, so it's nice to see it come back down,\\" Martin said. \\"That should be what happens the rest of the year, so we're hopefully on the path of improvement now.\\" TransUnion's analysis is derived from a sample of 10% of U.S. mortgage holders. Before the housing bust, mortgage delinquencies were running at less than 2% nationally. It took about three years after the housing market crashed for the delinquency rate on mortgages to climb to a peak of nearly 7% in the fourth quarter 2009. The rate has been trending down since then. Seasonal patterns — such as homeowners skipping payments to spend money elsewhere in the last three months of the year — were likely a factor in the uptick last fall. Still, the national delinquency rate remains well above its historical range, an indication many homeowners are still struggling five years after the housing downturn. \\"It's coming down a lot more slowly than it went back up,\\" Martin said. The delinquency rate won't likely get back down to its normal 2% level until housing prices recover. Home prices dropped in February in most major U.S. cities for a sixth-straight month, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home-price index. Still, there have been some bright spots in housing and economic trends this year that could point to further improvement in the mortgage delinquency rate. The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point since August to 8.1% last month — lowest since January 2009. Hiring has strengthened, despite posting weaker-than-anticipated gains in March and April. And the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter, aided by stronger consumer spending. And while sales of previously owned homes fell in March, a mild winter drove gains in January and February, making this year's winter the best for home sales in five years. As long as the economy, housing market and jobs outlook continue to improve, it's likely fewer homeowners will fall behind on their mortgage payments, Martin said. Another factor: Loans made between 2008 and 2011, after the housing crisis began, have a lower delinquency rate than older loans. \\"As time goes on, they become a bigger and bigger percentage of the total, so that helps bring the rates down as well,\\" Martin said. All but eight states saw their mortgage delinquency rate decline in the first quarter vs. the last three months of last year: Montana, Hawaii, Maine, North Dakota, New York, Maryland, Washington and Delaware. Florida led the nation with the highest mortgage delinquency rate 13.87%, down from 14.27% in the fourth quarter last year. The Sunshine State wasn't the only foreclosure hotbed where mortgage delinquency improved in the first quarter. The mortgage delinquency rate in Arizona was 6.86%, down from 7.50% in the fourth quarter of 2011. California's declined to 6.66% from 7.14%, while Nevada's fell to 11.16% from 12.08%.

Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: is it possible to be allergic to perfume? Possible answers: A). no B). yes","completion":"B). yes It is indeed possible to be allergic to perfume, as the condition called perfume intolerance or perfume allergy demonstrates. This condition occurs when individuals display sensitivity or allergic reactions to certain ingredients present in some perfumes or other fragrances. Perfume intolerance can manifest through various symptoms, such as skin irritation, respiratory issues, or headaches. Perfume intolerance or allergy may be triggered by natural or synthetic ingredients found in perfumes, including essential oils, synthetic fragrances, and various other chemicals. In some cases, people might be affected by specific ingredients or substances, while others may be sensitive to a combination of ingredients. This varying degree of sensitivity can further contribute to the wide range of symptoms and reactions experienced by individuals. When individuals with perfume intolerance or allergy come into contact with the fragrance ingredients, their immune system may recognize these substances as harmful or foreign. This reaction results in the production of antibodies and the release of chemicals like histamine, which can cause allergic symptoms such as itching, redness, swelling, and congestion. To prevent or manage perfume intolerance or allergy, people should identify the specific ingredients or fragrances that trigger their symptoms. This can be achieved through patch testing, which involves applying small amounts of various fragrance components to the skin to observe their reactions. Once the problematic ingredients are identified, individuals should avoid products containing these substances, opting for fragrance-free or hypoallergenic alternatives instead. It is essential to raise awareness about perfume intolerance or allergy, as it can significantly impact individuals' quality of life. By understanding this condition and taking appropriate measures to prevent symptoms, one can better navigate environments with potentially triggering fragrances and ensure their well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He ended his statement by reiterating his commitment to policies that support business growth and job creation in the state.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the provided information does not correctly answer the question about how the capital city of Brazil, Brasília, was created. The information given pertains to the city's per capita income, not its creation. Allow me to provide a detailed and accurate answer to the question: Brasília, the capital of Brazil, was created as a result of a development plan initiated by President Juscelino Kubitschek. The construction of Brasília was part of a larger plan known as \\"Plano de Metas\\" (Plan of Goals), which aimed to develop different sectors of Brazil's economy, such as energy, transport, and education, among others. The main objective of creating Brasília was to stimulate growth and development in the central-western region of Brazil, as well as to reduce the concentration of political and economic power in the coastal cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The decision to build the new capital was based on Article 4 of the Brazilian Constitution of 1891, which stated the need to create a new capital in the country's interior. The idea was revisited in the 1950s during President Kubitschek's term, and the new capital was seen as a symbol of modernity and progress for Brazil. The location for the new capital was strategically chosen in the Central Plateau of Brazil, approximately 1,000 kilometers west of Rio de Janeiro. This region was chosen for its relatively flat terrain, availability of water resources, and a favorable climate. In 1956, a committee led by Marechal José Pessoa was responsible for selecting the site for Brasília. To design the new capital, a competition was held in 1956, and architects from around the world were invited to present their ideas. Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer won the competition along with urban planner Lúcio Costa. Costa's design, known as the \\"Plano Piloto,\\" featured the city in the shape of an airplane, with different zones dedicated to various functions, such as residential, commercial, and administrative areas. Oscar Niemeyer, on the other hand, contributed with many iconic and modernist buildings, such as the National Congress, Cathedral, Planalto Palace, and the Alvorada Palace. The construction of Brasília started on April 20, 1956, and the city was officially inaugurated on April 21, 1960. The new capital attracted thousands of workers and settlers during the construction process, known as \\"Candangos.\\" These workers played a vital role in the city's construction, shaping its demographics, culture, and society. In summary, the creation of Brasília resulted from a development plan initiated by President Juscelino Kubitschek, aiming to promote growth in the interior while reducing the power concentration in coastal cities. The capital was strategically located in the Central Plateau, and its design was selected through an international competition, with Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa shaping the city's iconic appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What was the name of the person who drew Man of Sorrows? Answer the above question based on the context below: The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. Dürer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\". Dürer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\".Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although Dürer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The... Answer:","completion":"The name of the person who drew \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is Albrecht Dürer. He was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist who lived during the Renaissance. His work displayed a high level of technical excellence and intricate detail, showcased particularly in his portraiture. As the context indicates, Dürer was greatly influenced by southern German portraiture of the late 15th century, the Early Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and his own father, Albrecht the Elder. Dürer's \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is an artwork depicting Christ suffering, a theme commonly seen in Christian art during the time. It shows a deep emotional intensity and exemplifies Dürer's ability to skillfully capture complex human emotions and expressions. In the context provided, it is evident that Dürer developed his unique artistic style by blending various influences from different artistic traditions, including elements of southern German portraiture, Early Netherlandish painting techniques, and the use of silverpoint. Through his mastery of various mediums and techniques, Dürer managed to distinguish himself from his contemporaries. His attention to detail and strong focus on his subjects' faces made his work both visually striking and emotionally powerful. Additionally, his interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance is evident in his self-portraits and his portraits of his parents, which showcase the progression of aging and its impact on facial features. In conclusion, the person who drew \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is Albrecht Dürer, a prominent Renaissance artist known for his technical excellence and keen observational abilities. His artwork was a product of the influences and inspiration he drew from various artistic traditions, which he successfully combined to create a distinct and compelling style."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike?

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Story: A chef is preparing ribs for his clients dinner tonight. He decides to use a pressure cooker to help keep them nice and tender. He loads the ribs in the pressure cooker and closes the latches which are relatively easy to clamp down.

Summarize the following: If your heart is enlarged or the walls of your heart have become thicker, this can be in indication of several problems. For example, the doctor will likely measure the thickness of the wall of the left ventricle (the major pumping chamber of the heart). If it is thicker than 1.5 cm, this is considered abnormal. This or other thickened heart walls could indicate several problems including: High blood pressure Weak heart valves Damaged valves These measures can indicate whether your heart is pumping enough blood to supply your body with the oxygen it needs. If not, you are at risk for heart failure. There are two measurements the doctor may discuss with you: Left ventricular ejection fraction. This is the percentage of blood that is expelled from the heart during a heartbeat. A left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% is considered normal. Cardiac output. This is the volume of blood that the heart pumps per minute. At rest the average adult's heart pumps 4.8 to 6.4 liters of blood per minute. If parts of the wall of the heart are not pumping strongly, this can help the doctor pinpoint areas that have been damaged. This can occur due to tissue damage from a prior heart attack or coronary artery disease. Your doctor will be looking for several things: Hyperkinesis. This occurs when the heart or parts of the walls of the heart contract too much. Hypokinesis. This occurs when the contractions are too weak. Akinesis. This occurs when the tissue does not contract. Dyskinesis. This occurs when the wall of the heart bulges out when it should be contracting. You will likely be able to see the valves as gray lines that open and close with each beat of the heart enabling blood to pass between the chambers. Possible problems that you may see could be: A valve does not close tightly and it lets blood flow backwards through it. A valve does not open all the way so it restricts blood flow. You may be able to observe structural problems such as: Openings between chambers that should not be there Passages between the heart and blood vessels Heart defects that are developing a fetus","completion":"An enlarged or thickened heart can indicate issues such as high blood pressure, weak or damaged valves, potentially leading to heart failure. Doctors may measure the left ventricular wall thickness, and analyze left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output to assess the heart's functionality. They will also look for signs of hyperkinesis, hypokinesis, akinesis, and dyskinesis, which represent varying levels of heart wall contractions. Valves should be observed to ensure proper opening and closing for blood flow, while structural problems and heart defects should also be identified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. I am facing a new situation today: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which patient would have lower level of testosterone, patient A or patient C? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the details of the new situation, patient A, a male with Klinefelter's syndrome, would have a lower level of testosterone compared to patient C, who is a male without any of these illnesses. Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs due to the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. This extra genetic material interferes with male sexual development and affects the normal functioning of the testicles. As a result, individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome have reduced levels of testosterone, which is the primary male sex hormone responsible for the development of male reproductive tissues, secondary sexual characteristics, and sexual function. In contrast, patient C is a male without Klinefelter's syndrome or any of the other mentioned genetic conditions. Therefore, it is expected that patient C would have normal testicular function and testosterone levels, which would be higher than the testosterone levels in patient A, who has Klinefelter's syndrome. In conclusion, patient A, the male with Klinefelter's syndrome, would have a lower level of testosterone compared to patient C, a male without any of these illnesses."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the building that an explorer found a well preserved room where \\"the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation.\\"?, using the article: In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins. They described the kivas as \\"circular apartments sunk in the ground\\". Simpson briefly explored..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The name of the building that the explorer found with a well-preserved room where \\"the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation\\" is Chetro Ketl.

At the office Willard is constantly belittled by Martin, finding understanding from Joan Simms (Sondra Locke).At home there is the celebration of his birthday, Charlotte Stassen (Jody Gilbert) and the rest of his mom's friends nag him about being more aggressive and going for an executive job, although Henrietta thinks that he wouldn't have been able to take charge of the business. He is nagged by his mother, particularly to kill some rats she has seen in their backyard. In the process of exterminating the rats, Willard saves them and finds as he feeds and plays with them that he can train the animals, by feeding them, and setting himself in their instincts as a rescuer. He baits the rats onto a pillar in the center of a well, and removes the wood bridge that they crossed. Then, as he fills the well, they are frantic, and he replaces the wood bridge; thus he cements their allegiance, and, in effect communicates with them.

How Frida Kahlo's bright, beautiful garden inspired her In 1953 Frida Kahlo was preparing for an exhibition, drawing invitations on rose-pink pieces of card from her sick bed. It was an exciting moment for the 46-year-old artist, who had painted almost every day since a trolley-car accident had put an end to her medical studies two months after her 18th birthday, and left her bedridden for two years. But despite her resilience – she had already survived more than 30 operations on her spine and pelvis – her husband, the muralist Diego Rivera, was worried that she would not be well enough to attend. At the last moment he organised for her to be transported to the gallery in her four-poster canopy bed. From its cushions, and wearing one of her typically resplendent traditional Tehuana dresses, she held court, elated by the turn-out. To one journalist she said, “I am broken. But I am happy to be alive as long as I can paint.” Kahlo died the following year, after months in hospital that left her in a drugged stupor. Her last request when she came home was that she be moved to a room with a better view; she wanted to see her garden. Now a new book, Frida Kahlo’s Garden, which accompanies an exhibition at the New York Botanical Garden, shows how Kahlo’s love of the plants and trees that grew there came to energise her life and art. In many respects, the Casa Azul, or Blue House, in the Coyoacán area of Mexico City, where Kahlo lived for most of her life, and its garden can be counted as one of her artworks. Bought by her father in 1904 – three years before she was born – it came to her in 1939, when Rivera took over the mortgage. Over the years she and Rivera renovated, expanded and re-envisioned both the house and garden to express their wide-ranging tastes and their commitment to the idea of Mexico. Kahlo in particular treasured plants and used her affinity for colour to assemble pots and plant beds, which she embellished with a roster of sculptures and ancient stones. Photographs from the time show every wall, railing and column bursting with climbing vegetation, and plants in every architectural niche. The garden was a place of both comfort and inspiration for Kahlo; an immersive world where she could think about her work or entertain friends. Of the photographs we have of Kahlo with her lover Leon Trotsky, the Russian revolutionary who spent his exile in Mexico, several picture the two in the garden. And when she took up teaching, she used it as an open-air classroom for her students, nicknamed “Los Fridos” for their disciple-like devotion. Inside the house, Kahlo took to creating compositions of fruits and flowers for Rivera. On a big pine table in her sunny dining room she would arrange varying combinations of marigolds, blue and white irises, dahlias, calla lilies and violets. • The secret diary of Frida Kahlo Kahlo’s penchant for collecting is well known. Throughout her life she amassed tens of thousands of objects, including porcelain tea sets, papier-mâché religious figures, rustic cooking vessels and hundreds of the devotional paintings on tin known as ex-votos. But she also had a fondness for books, and often pressed flowers within their pages. The exhibition contains her copy of Walt Whitman’s poetic masterpiece Leaves of Grass, complete with tiny bouquets of dried leaves and petals that have lain undisturbed for years. And although the majority of her books relate to art and literature, slotted among them are copies of botanical field guides, books on Mexican medicinal plants and even a copy of an illustrated herbal handbook dating from 1552, which provides first-hand descriptions of the plants used by the Aztecs; plants from its pages are well represented in Kahlo’s art. In Kahlo’s time there was a great movement around the world to learn about Mexico. Even though the country had consummated independence from Spain in 1821 and endured the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1917), when resentment against U.S. business interests had bubbled to the surface, it was still struggling to shape an identity. Art, architecture and day-to-day life were still overshadowed by European influence. Kahlo was very taken with the nationalistic cause. She altered her stated year of birth from 1907 to 1910, to coincide with the year the revolution began, and fought to maintain the presence of indigenous art and ideals in her work and in her home. She and Rivera built an Aztec-style pyramid in their garden, and used its terraced walls to display ancient artefacts. They rid the house of its neo-classical, European elements and painted the walls bright blue, using a traditional Mexican pigment. The original garden emulated the 19th-century European taste for ferns and palms. To these Kahlo added native plants such as agave, cactus and prickly pear, which grew alongside orange and apricot trees, quince and pomegranate. Many of these plants found their way on to her body – she almost always wore flowers threaded through her hair – and into her paintings. The garden of her childhood features in My Grandparents, My Parents, and I (1936), and in her Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) she is surrounded by a wall of vegetation that threatens to overwhelm her. These elephant ear plants can still be seen growing in the Casa Azul today. Her love of flowers, fruits and vegetables is most vividly expressed in her still-life paintings. She liked to use native fruits and flowers as a means of highlighting her Mexican heritage and nationality. “Mexican intellectuals were not just rediscovering native traditions and rituals, they were also discovering the Mexican natural world again, and the plant world particularly,” Adriana Zavala, the exhibition curator and author of the book, says. Kahlo would have been very familiar with the Dutch and Spanish still-life tradition, examples of which would have come over with the conquistadors. A painting of magnolia blooms is one of her most beautiful interpretations of this genre. In all likelihood, she used the magnolia that still grows in her courtyard as her model. But her decision to paint it went much deeper. The flower appealed to her because its unopened buds resemble a heart – one of her lovers, the Spanish artist Josep Bartolí, recalled Kahlo saying, “Fruits are like flowers – they speak to us in provocative language and teach us things that are hidden.” Kahlo was fascinated by symbols and myths, and often her depictions of plants are emblematic. Still Life (for Samuel Fastlicht) (1951), for example (Fastlicht was her dentist – she formed strong attachments to the doctors who attended her), is full of species that produce both male and female flowers on a single plant. These kinds of pairings – men and women, sun and moon, life and death – appear often in her paintings, but their meaning is never quite clear. “Kahlo had a very witty sense of humour,” Zavala says. “So a painting of mangos and cantaloupes can be in dialogue with the still-life tradition, but the way she parts the fruits gives them an almost malevolent or sexual quality. Sometimes they may relate to her sense of her mortality, but I don’t think her works are ever entirely biographical, or ever entirely malevolent or entirely celebratory. There’s always a contradiction or a balancing.” The Mexico City Kahlo grew up in was blessed with beautiful public gardens. Her neighbourhood of Coyoacán was known for its leafy squares and parks. It was also a hot spot for horticulture, particularly a large tree nursery known as the Viveros de Coyoacán. About a mile from her home was a famous sanatorium, where one of Mexico’s leading surgeons, Dr Aureliano Urrutia, turned the grounds into a private garden dedicated to health and history. And later she and Rivera would often visit the so-called “floating gardens” of the Aztecs, south of Mexico City, where tourists and locals rode large, flat-bottomed boats through a series of shallow lakes and canals that ran through the thick vegetation like lace. • Rich people shouldn't perv over Frida Kahlo's exquisite love letters One cannot help but imagine Kahlo painting outside, listening to the sounds of the parakeets and her pet monkeys. But this was not the case. “She wasn’t really a spontaneous, plein-air artist,” Zavala says. “She was incredibly meticulous, starting in an upper corner and slowly working her way down and across with a very fine paintbrush. But I absolutely believe that her garden sustained her. It’s why she transformed it. I think of it as an environment that nurtured her creativity.” “Frida Kahlo’s Garden” (Prestel, £22.50), by Adriana Zavala, is available from the Telegraph Bookshop for £19.99 plus £1.95 p&p What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Frida Kahlo was a famous artist who loved bright and beautiful things, especially her garden at her blue house in Mexico City. Her garden was filled with many colorful plants, flowers, and trees. This garden was very special to her and it inspired a lot of her paintings. She liked to put the plants and flowers in her artwork to show her love for her Mexican heritage. Her garden made her very happy and helped her create her beautiful paintings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Generate a question that has the following answer: At a strip club. for the following movie plot: Liz is a Los Angeles street prostitute. The audience first sees her attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passerby gives her his handkerchief and offers to take her to a hospital. She refuses, makes up a boyfriend story and asks for some money. She sends him the money back with a thank you note and a new handkerchief. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake. Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy. After the movie, Liz talks to the audience about her son, whom she clearly loves, though he's now in foster care. She finally gets a customer and services him. He has a heart...

Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: \\"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\\" Baker has described Schwarzenegger as \\"[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\\" but claims towards the end of the relationship he became \\"insufferable – classically conceited – the world revolved around him\\". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had \\"little understanding of polite society\\" and she found him a turn-off, she says, \\"He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.\\" Now answer this question: What historical event did Baker and Schwarzenegger watch on TV together on their first date?","completion":"Baker and Schwarzenegger watched the first Apollo Moon landing on television together on their first date."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process is the occurrence of an earthquake. The seismic waves generated by the release of energy from the crumbling rocks and movement along the cracks, or fault lines, propagate through the Earth's crust. These waves can cause the ground to shake, resulting in the phenomenon we know as an earthquake. When the seismic waves reach the Earth's surface, they can cause significant damage to natural landscapes, human infrastructures, and even alter the environment in the vicinity of the fault line. The intensity of the shaking and the resulting damage can vary greatly depending on factors such as the amount of built-up stress released, the depth at which the cracks have formed and the movement occurred, the type of rocks and soil present in the area, and the population density in the region affected by the earthquake. In some instances, secondary hazards can also arise from earthquakes. For example, the shaking can trigger landslides and soil liquefaction, which can lead to further destruction of infrastructure and loss of life. Moreover, if the faults are located underwater or near a coastline, the movement of the Earth's crust could generate tsunamis, which are massive ocean waves that can cause widespread devastation upon reaching the shore. After an earthquake occurs, rescue and recovery efforts usually follow. These efforts may involve searching for and rescuing trapped individuals, providing medical assistance to the injured, assessing and repairing damaged infrastructures, and implementing rebuilding or relocation plans. Scientists and seismologists also continue to analyze the geological data from the earthquake to understand the processes that led to the event and develop methods to mitigate the impacts of future seismic activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. Answer this question please: In which stage the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase, stage A or stage B? A:","completion":"In stage A, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase. This is because, during stage A, Rob keeps the gas at room temperature (300 K), which means there is no change in temperature, and thus no change in the kinetic energy of the gas molecules.

News article: For our latest mission, we brought the movie Ghostbusters to life in the reading room of The New York Public Library at 42 Street. The 1984 movie begins with a scene in the very same room, so we figured it was time for the Ghostbusters to make an encore appearance. Enjoy the video first and then go behind-the-scenes with the photos and report below. Agents Hines, Purnell, Lathan, and Scordelis The New York Public Library approached us about a month ago and asked if we would want to stage an Improv Everywhere mission on their property. The library is facing serious budget cuts, and they thought having us do something awesome there might serve to remind people of how great the NYPL is. We couldn’t say no to the opportunity to do something in their gorgeous, 100 year-old Rose Main Reading Room. It actually wasn’t the first time we staged something on the NYPL grounds. Back in 2002, we held a ridiculous protest claiming to be a group called Writers Against Piracy . That mission was, of course, unauthorized. It was nice to get invited by the library this time around and to have their permission to set up our cameras. When brainstorming ideas for the mission, I immediately thought of Ghostbusters. The NYPL is heavily featured in the beginning of the movie, opening with a crane shot of the lion statue outside and cutting to the reading room. The thought of bringing the Ghostbusters back to the library 25 years later cracked me up. Agent Lathan and his binocular glasses Agent Purnell puts on his fake mustache Showing the ghosts a map of the reading room We met on the steps out front and got organized. Agent Adams came up with a plan to spread our team of six camera people discreetly around the room. Most of our operators used DSLR cameras, which allowed them to blend in perfectly with the constant stream of tourists taking photos of the historic room. I went over all of the blocking and timing with the actors. They then headed inside to a staging area and got into costume. Agent Rodgers was the first ghost to enter. He grabbed a book off of a shelf on the way in and started heading for a seat. He was quickly stopped by a security guard, who had no idea what was going on. Guard: Sir, what are you doing? Rodgers: Um… haunting the library. The guard allowed him to take a seat, and then went over to the information desk to laugh about it with another employee. Rodgers takes his seat. Notice the girl in pink’s reaction (behind the girl in white) The first ghost got some nice reactions from the folks he sat by, but they eventually went back to working when it became clear the ghost was just going to sit and read a book. That is, until ghost number two entered. Agent Walker enters as the second ghost (note the same guard reacting in the background) Ghost working in the middle of the crowd Closeup of the ghost’s computer screen After about five minutes, the final ghost made his entrance. He walked down the aisle and headed over to the dictionary stand. Agent Vernon With three ghosts spread out in the reading room, who you gonna call? Ghostbusters surveying the room Tourists and library patrons take notice (and photos!) of the Ghostbusters The first ghost reads, unaware of the danger he’s in As soon as the Ghostbusters spotted the ghosts, Agent Lathan shouted, “Get ’em!” The ghost leaps to his feet All three ghosts leapt up and immediately started running around and making ghost noises. Agent Hines finds the computer-using ghost While the ghost-phase of the mission was pretty low-key, as soon as the chase started the room came alive. The room full of library patrons and tourists all started laughing, smiling, and frantically getting out their cameras and camera phones. It was cool to see tables full of people taking off their headphones and laughing with each other. Agent Scordelis follows a ghost out the door The whole chase lasted less than a minute, as we didn’t want to be too disruptive to the people trying to get their work done. The Ghostbusters weren’t able to get their hands on the ghosts and ended up following them out of the reading room. After they left, the room broke out in applause. The Ghostbusters chase wasn’t quite over yet. They followed the ghosts down the stairs and out the front door of the building! The chase continues down Fifth Avenue The Ghostbusters rounded the corner onto 42nd Street and disappeared out of view in pursuit of the ghosts. My guess is that they were successful, as the Ghostbusters were spotted later in the day in good spirits posing for a photo with a young fan. Mission Accomplished.

There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Besides the playback system, acoustic limitations were negatively affected by the loss of delicate sounds and fine overtones, the need for a high amount of sound energy to vibrate the recording horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism, and mechanical resonances present in the recording process.

Answer the following question: Process: - When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock - When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more water gets into cracks in the rocks happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER erosion of rocks. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The proposed perturbation hypothesis states that if more water gets into cracks in rocks, it will lead to more or faster erosion of rocks. To evaluate the potential effects of this perturbation, let's consider each step involved in the erosion process and how increased water infiltration might impact them: Step 1: When water freezes, it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space. - If more water gets into cracks, there will be a greater volume of water that will expand upon freezing. This would mean that the force exerted on the walls of the cracks will be greater due to the increased volume of expanding ice. Step 2: As water expands, it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it. - With the increased volume of water in the cracks and, therefore, greater pressure on the rock walls, the likelihood of the rock splitting or breaking apart becomes higher. Step 3: The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack. - As more water occupies and expands within the crack, the walls of the crack will be pushed farther apart, leading to a more significant widening and deepening of the crack. Step 4: Clay expands when wet, like ice does. - If more water is entering the cracks, then more clay particles may be exposed to this water, leading to increased expansion and destabilization of the rock structure. Step 5: This causes the rock to break apart. - With more water infiltrating and expanding within the cracks, combined with expanding clay particles, the rock is more likely to break apart due to increased pressure and instability. Step 6: Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock. - These plants may benefit from the increased availability of water in the cracks, enabling them to grow more quickly and spread their roots further into the rock. Step 7: When they do this, their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks. - The faster growth of plants like mosses and lichens due to increased water availability can lead to more roots penetrating the rock, further contributing to the erosion process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have a significant effect on the rock erosion process. More water getting into the cracks of rocks leads to increased pressure, clay expansion, and plant growth, all of which contribute to faster and more extensive erosion of rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. and the situation: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) . - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp). - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes. - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines. - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south. - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'cebidae'.

And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"How does the Iranian President speak to the Western media?\\" Response: \\"He makes provocative statements and mercurial rants\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph.

Known for his illustrious career on the field, the ex-Manchester United star has become the subject of a legal battle that has captured the nation's attention. The events leading up to this trial began when authorities uncovered certain discrepancies in Cantona's business and financial dealings. As new evidence emerged, it became clear that the case was of a serious nature, prompting the French judiciary to take action and bring Cantona to court. The trial has attracted extensive media coverage both nationally and internationally, as Cantona's fans and sports enthusiasts seek to understand the events that led to their beloved footballer's entanglement in legal complications. Some have expressed shock and disappointment at the allegations circling around the football icon, while others stand firm in their support of Cantona. The prosecution will aim to present a strong case against Cantona, providing evidence that could potentially tarnish the legacy of one of France's most celebrated sportsmen. Meanwhile, Cantona's defense team is expected to contest the accusations with an equally robust argument, in an attempt to ensure that their client's reputation remains as unblemished as possible. As the trial unfolds, the French public is left to grapple with the rather unsettling notion that their former football hero may indeed face significant consequences if found guilty. The outcome of this case will not only impact Cantona's professional and personal life but also serve as a reminder that even the most revered figures are not immune to controversy and legal scrutiny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After discovering an antique metal plate near a construction site, Ernest shows it to Dr. Melon who believes that it came from a giant Revolutionary War cannon called \\"Goliath\\", (named after the legendary biblical giant). Dr. Melon had previously been ridiculed by his peers for theorizing that the real Crown Jewels of England were stolen during the Revolutionary War and were actually hidden inside the long-lost cannon. They begin to search for the artifact near the construction site and eventually locate it inside an abandoned mine. They are ambushed by historical antiquity collector and Dr. Melon's colleague Dr. Glencliff whom they then lead on an action-packed chase through the countryside.

Dr. Melon's wife, Nan, on the other hand is only after him and Ernest for the jewels. While everyone is hot on their trail, Ernest develops a deep friendship with Dr. Melon. After crashing the cannon into a forest, Ernest locates the jewels, not in its barrel as the legend describes but in the gunpowder kegs. After putting the crown on his head, he finds himself unable to get it off.

Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Ohio State Buckeyes are the athletic teams that represent The Ohio State University, named after the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye.

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs.

The county seat of Suffolk County, NY lies at the mouth of a river that flows into which body of water? Answer:","completion":"The county seat of Suffolk County, NY is Riverhead, which lies at the mouth of the Peconic River. The Peconic River flows into the Peconic Bay, a large body of water located between the North and South Forks of Long Island, New York. Peconic Bay is further divided into two sections: the Great Peconic Bay and the Little Peconic Bay. The Great Peconic Bay is the larger, western section of the bay, and it lies between the western areas of the North Fork (Riverhead, Flanders, and Jamesport) and the South Fork (Westhampton Beach, Quogue, Hampton Bays, and Southampton). The Little Peconic Bay is the smaller, eastern section of Peconic Bay, which sits between the eastern portions of the North Fork (Cutchogue, Southold, and Greenport) and the South Fork (Bridgehampton, Sag Harbor, and East Hampton). The Peconic Bay system is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Shinnecock Canal, which runs between Great Peconic Bay and Shinnecock Bay, and Gardiners Bay, which connects near the eastern end of Little Peconic Bay. These connections allow for the exchange of water between the Peconic system and the surrounding coastal waters of Long Island, enhancing the quality and biodiversity of its marine habitats. In addition to its ecological importance, Peconic Bay contributes to the local economy through its many recreational and commercial activities. The bay is a popular destination for boating, fishing, sailing, and other water-based activities, while its numerous beaches, parks, and nature preserves offer opportunities for further exploration and relaxation. The presence of Riverhead, the county seat of Suffolk County, at the mouth of the Peconic River highlights the significance of this water system within the region and the state.

Western powers are now becoming increasingly concerned that so-called Islamic State (IS) has built a presence in the North African state and the US has responded by launching air strikes on the militant group. Only Libya's myriad armed militias really wield power - and it is felt they often hold the politicians they supposedly back to ransom. During the uprising, anyone with a gun could command respect, and lots of armed groups emerged - up to 1,700, according to some estimates. There are two rival parliaments and three governments - the latest government was formed in UN-brokered talks with the aim of replacing the other two. But this initiative is still on the rocks, partly because of concerns that the new government is being imposed by Western powers. The oil-rich country once had one of the highest standards of living in Africa, with free healthcare and free education, but six years on from the uprising, it is facing a financial crisis. This turmoil has allowed IS to gain a foothold in the country. Top IS leaders 'take refuge' in Libya IS had taken control of an \\"enclave\\" in and around the city of Sirte, the birthplace of Gaddafi. Security experts feared this could provide a safe haven for jihadists to train, fund and plan attacks in North Africa and across the Mediterranean. However, pro-government forces backed by the West have now pushed back the Islamists and retaken the city. Some security analysts describe Libya as an arms bazaar. It is awash with weapons looted from Gaddafi's arsenal - making an ideal playground for jihadists fleeing air strikes in Syria and Iraq. IS has been attacking Libyan oil facilities, has kidnapped several foreign oil workers and in 2015 was behind two high-profile attacks on Tunisia's tourism industry - carried out by gunmen trained in Libya. Tunisia has built a partial security barrier and trench along its border with Libya aimed at preventing further atrocities. Beheadings and racial tension: Life under Islamic State How IS's Libya foothold threatens UK The Libyans gaining ground on IS The US has carried out at least four known air strikes in Libya since 2015. The latest one, in January, targeted an alleged training camp on the outskirts of Sirte where some IS militants had fled after the city fell. The UK and France also have special forces operating in the North African state - the nature and extent of these operations have largely been secretive. Three French soldiers died in July 2016 when their helicopter was shot down by militiamen who identified themselves as belonging to a new militant group called Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB). Last year, plans were unveiled to send 6,000 troops from a number of Nato countries, including the UK and France, to Libya to train local troops to stop IS-linked groups from gaining more territory and to provide security to diplomatic missions that were looking to move back to the capital. However, the new unity government was reluctant to openly allow or request such a presence and the plan has still not materialised. Former US President Barack Obama, in an interview published in April 2016, said that the \\"worst mistake\\" of his presidency was the failure to prepare for the aftermath of Col Gaddafi's overthrow. He partly blamed then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron for \\"the mess\\", saying he had not done enough to support the North African nation whose instability was threatening its neighbours and was a factor in Europe's migrant crisis. Parliamentary elections held in 2014 were disputed. Those who held power refused to give it up and remained in the capital, Tripoli. The newly elected parliament then moved to the port of Tobruk, 1,000km (620 miles) away and set up a rival government. This parliament still has the official backing of the UN as Libya's official legislative body - despite the fact that it is opposed to the new unity administration. It wants Gen Khalifa Haftar, who is leading the battle against Islamist militias, to keep a senior role in a future army, something the UN agreement does not guarantee. The UN-mediated deal for a unity government has seen the formation of a nine-member Presidency Council, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj. He arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 to set up his administration and has been trying to win the support of the various militias and politicians, but it has little real power over the whole country. The council has also suffered from divisions. Two members boycotted it continuously, eventually moving to the east, while another member resigned. Mr Sarraj, an engineer by profession, approved the 1 August 2016 US air strike on suspected IS positions in Sirte, in the first co-ordinated military action between his government and the US. Has Libya pulled back from the brink? They were united in their hatred for Gaddafi - but nothing more. There was no single group in charge of the rebellion. Militias were based in different cities, fighting their own battles. They are also ideologically divided - some of them are militant or moderate Islamists, others are secessionists or monarchists and yet others are liberals. Furthermore, the militias are split along regional, ethnic and local lines, making it a combustible mix. And after more than four decades of authoritarian rule, they had little understanding of democracy. So they were unable to forge compromises and build a new state based on the rule of law.

Banks are still strapped for cash, however, and there is little foreign currency available officially. The black market exchange rate has sky-rocketed in recent months, and food prices have risen.

Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman Loera, a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means \\"Shorty,\\" is the most wanted man in Mexico. He's also one of the most wanted men in the United States. Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel, which is battling for turf along the border. For five years, the State Department has kept a 5 million bounty on his head, calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security. Guzman, who leads the Sinaloa cartel, is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border. He recently upped the stakes, ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors, according to the Los Angeles Times. The cartel's tentacles and those of its chief rival, the Gulf cartel, already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March. \\"No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does,\\" said Arabit, who heads the DEA's office in this year's border hot spot, El Paso, Texas. See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. A December 2008 report by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities. So far, the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico, where the cartels' running gunbattles with police, the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year. It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007. Once again, drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year, Arabit said. See who the key players are ». The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker, DEA agents say. But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire. \\"It's coming. I guarantee, it's coming,\\" said Michael Sanders, a DEA spokesman in Washington. Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman's shoot-to-kill instructions aren't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing sources and intelligence memos. The move is seen as dangerously brazen, the newspaper reported. In the past, the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement. U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border. The Obama administration committed to spending an additional 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border. But 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target. Guzman, who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel, is said to be worth 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade. He made this year's Forbes list of the richest of the rich, landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune. Popular Mexican songs, called narcocorridos, embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader. \\"Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico,\\" said security consultant Scott Stewart, invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993. Stewart, a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor, a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman's worth. Just a decade ago, Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians, moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels. The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back. Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits. Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, according to the DEA. Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine. Marijuana became the cartels' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007, bringing in 8.5 billion. Cocaine came in second, at 3.9 billion, and methamphetamine earned 1 billion, a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year. Watch how marijuana became the cartels' top cash crop ». The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels, but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border, according to the DEA agents, local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN. The cartels' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa, Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence. The status and alliances of the players continue to shift. Although the DEA and some analysts disagree, others say the Zetas, a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police, are now running the Gulf cartel. \\"From what we've seen, the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel,\\" analyst Stewart said. \\"In violent times, soldiers tend to rise to the top.\\" These soldiers are incredibly well-armed, police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime \\"Hummer\\" Gonzalez Duran. It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles, including AK-47s; 287 grenades; two rocket launchers; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. At the very least, the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table. The DEA's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate. Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a former military man who is also known as \\"El Lazco,\\" or \\"The Executioner.\\" The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors. The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas; Sonora Nogales, across from Nogales, Arizona; and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California. Two years ago, the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas. It's all about the highways that help move the drugs. Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor, and Juarez has easy access to I-10, a major east-west interstate, and I-25, which runs north to Denver, Colorado. Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5, which heads north all the way to the Canadian border. Some of the battles are internal, Arabit said. Some are with other cartels. And some, he said, can be attributed to the cartels' \\"desperate\\" attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers. As soon as he took office in January 2007, Calderon called out the cartels. He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and, in some cases, do the job of local police. Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office. The violence involves beheadings, running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches. Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight. The cartels' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets. \\"The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq,\\" analyst Stewart said. \\"It was simple machismo. The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas.\\" When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant, beneficiaries of their location. Today, they are shadows of their former selves, weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders. Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997. Known as \\"The King of the Skies\\" for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes, he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest. Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery. Two of them later were killed. His death, along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen, set the stage for the ongoing turf battle. When Cardenas was extradited in 2007, Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez as well as Nogales. Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston, Texas, where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros, Mexico. Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana, and last year, Guzman made a move on that plaza as well. \\"Right now, they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar,\\" said the DEA's Elizabeth Kempshall, who heads the agency's office in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix has become the nation's kidnapping capital, largely because of the cartels' increasing presence. Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition: \\"That is the worst thing for any cartel leader, to face justice in the United States.\\" CNN's Eliott C.

Romney still holds wide lead in New Hampshire: poll LITTLETON, New Hampshire | Sat Oct 8, 2011 11:57am EDT LITTLETON, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney holds a wide lead in the early primary state of New Hampshire, with former pizza executive Herman Cain a distant second place, a poll showed. Romney, a former governor from neighboring Massachusetts, leads the Republican field with 37 percent support in the poll released late on Friday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center/WMUR. Cain trails with 12 percent, followed by Texas congressman Ron Paul at 9 percent and former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman at 8 percent. \\"Romney is solid here and has the highest favorability ratings, and he's had those for two years,\\" said Andrew Smith, director of the polling group. \\"It's kind of an obstacle course for the front-runner, but as long as they make it through those obstacles they win.\\" In the polling group's last poll in July, Romney had 35 percent support. New Hampshire's primary, traditionally the first in the nation, could be held in early January or even December following moves by other states to bring forward their primaries or caucuses. New Hampshire's mostly moderate Republicans had little love for Tea Party favorites Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann. Texas Governor Perry drew just 4 percent, tied with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Minnesota congresswoman Bachmann lagged at just 2 percent. The poll of 345 likely Republican primary voters was conducted between September 26 and October 6, and had a margin of error of 5.3 percentage points. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has not entered the race, was at 8 percent. Three percent backed former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who said on October 5 that she would not run. A range of data showed Romney's strength in the state, where he owns a vacation home: 65 percent of those polled said they expect Romney to win the Republican nomination, and 52 percent said he was the Republican with the best chance to beat President Barack Obama in the November 2012 general election. Cain is the latest Republican to gain momentum and appear as a potential alternative to Romney. Perry, Bachmann and Gingrich all briefly emerged as potential challengers to Romney in New Hampshire before fading. \\"There have been a number of people who have gotten that bounce over 10 percent but haven't been able to consolidate support,\\" Smith said. Republican candidates will debate in Hanover, New Hampshire, on Tuesday. (Reporting by Jason McLure, editing by Ros Krasny and Eric Beech) What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a poll that shows Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, has a big lead in the state of New Hampshire.

Before you look for a hotel and make a reservation, you want to ensure the hotel will meet your budget and your needs. You should first determine your budget, or how much you can spend, when booking a hotel room. Can we draw the following conclusion? Expense is not a consideration when searching for hotel rooms. Options: (i) Yes (ii) It's impossible to say (iii) No","completion":"(iii) No The conclusion \\"Expense is not a consideration when searching for hotel rooms\\" is incorrect. Based on the information provided, determining your budget is an essential step when booking a hotel room. It is important to consider your budget and plan accordingly when searching for a hotel room to make sure it fits your needs and financial constraints. Below is a more detailed process to assist you in booking a hotel room. 1. Determine your budget: As mentioned, the first step in booking a hotel room is to decide how much you are willing to spend. This will help you narrow down your options and focus on hotels that are within your price range. 2. Choose your destination and travel dates: Once you have set a budget, decide on your destination and the dates of your trip. This information is critical as it will determine hotel availability and prices during your travel period. 3. Research hotel options: Start by searching for hotels in your chosen destination within your budget range. There are several platforms and websites you can use, such as Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor. You can also check hotel chain websites or contact travel agents. Be sure to read reviews and compare prices and amenities to make an informed decision. 4. Consider hotel location and amenities: While looking for a hotel, pay attention to its location concerning key attractions, transportation, and dining options. Additionally, compare the hotel's amenities such as free breakfast, Wi-Fi, parking, airport shuttle, fitness center, and swimming pool. Prioritize the amenities most important to you and don't forget to consider any additional fees that may apply. 5. Check for discounts and deals: Look for any hotel discounts or deals that may be available. You may find special promotions, seasonal offers, or discounts for booking directly on the hotel's website. Additionally, if you are a member of a loyalty program or have a credit card with rewards, check if you can use them toward your stay. 6. Make your reservation: Once you have found a suitable hotel, go ahead and book your room. Make sure to read the booking terms and conditions, including the hotel's cancellation policy. Keep a record of your reservation details, such as the confirmation number and contact information for the hotel. 7. Double-check your reservation: A few days before your trip, contact the hotel to confirm your reservation. This will help you avoid any issues upon arrival and gives you the chance to make any last-minute changes if necessary. In conclusion, it is essential to take expense into consideration when searching for hotel rooms since it directly impacts the options available and the overall travel experience.

The classic understanding is that citizens form opinions on various issues, and then elect representatives who share those opinions. Moreover, when politicians deviate from the will of their constituents while in office, voters can simply vote them out of office in favor of a candidate more closely aligned with their views. Government by the people, for the people, and reflecting the will of the people. As you might imagine, political scientists' understanding of this relationship between public opinion and politician behavior has grown more complicated in recent decades. Some argue that politicians shape public opinion by showing that their positions are consistent with voters' underlying values. Other research suggests that voters often support policies simply because their favorite political leaders do. Now, a paper by political scientists at UC Berkeley and the Washington University in St. Louis reports on the results of a novel real-world experiment. The study finds that contrary to classic theories of democracy, voters did not view politicians more negatively when the politicians took positions voters opposed. Not only that, voters often adopted these positions themselves, even when politicians offered little or no justification for them. These results \\"leave open the possibility that politicians think the constraints public opinion places on them are stronger than they are,\\" the authors conclude, and they suggest that \\"politicians can enjoy broad latitude to shape public opinion.\\" Here's how the experiment worked: The researchers recruited 7 Democratic state lawmakers in an unnamed midwestern state. In the spring of 2014, the researchers surveyed registered voters in the lawmakers' districts to determine which issue positions had the least public support. The issues included everything from immigration to taxation to marijuana policy. The legislators then sent official letters to registered voters of both political parties in their respective districts. The letters were targeted toward voters who had expressed opinions that were at odds with the lawmakers' own stances. The voters were randomly assigned to receive one of three letters. From the report: (i) a “control” letter where the legislator introduced themselves, described the services their office could conduct for constituents, and described a few locally oriented achievements (e.g., designating a building downtown a historic place), (ii) a “direct” policy letter that added language in which the legislators took a position the recipient had not agreed with previously and made only the briefest justification for their position, and (iii) an “arguments” policy letter that added extensive arguments for this position designed to appeal to citizens’ values Finally, they performed a follow-up survey of the constituents to see how their opinions of both the issues and the politicians had changed, if at all. As it turns out, the positions staked out by the legislators had a significant effect on their constituents views: \\"The constituents who were sent letters with the legislators’ positions were about 5 percentage points less likely to disagree with the legislator and about 5 percentage points more likely to agree with the legislator.\\" More surprisingly, it didn't make a difference whether politicians provided good arguments for their positions or not: \\"We find little evidence that legislators’ arguments were responsible for their persuasive impact. Legislators appeared able to move constituents’ opinions by stating their own positions with minimal justification; adding additional arguments did not make them more persuasive.\\" Finally, lawmaker favorability was completely unaffected by knowledge of their policy stances. \\"We find no evidence that legislators suffered electoral costs by taking positions constituents disagreed with; citizens who received letters from their legislators taking positions they had disagreed with previously evaluated their legislators no less favorably.\\" \\"We were surprised by the fact that there wasn't any pushback from the constituents in terms of disapproval,\\" co-author Dan Butler said in an interview. Since voters tend to not know a lot about their state legislators, the expectation was that finding out about a disagreement would lead voters to perceive them more negatively. \\"It seems like a lot of people are predisposed to trust their legislators, even on policies we think of as inspiring a lot of controversy,\\" co-author David Broockman said. \\"Most legislators really do care about advancing the public interest. What's exciting here, and the reason why the lawmakers were interested in participating in the study, is that it gives them insight into whether they can help advance those causes further.\\" We tend to think of voters' political views as fixed and immobile, particularly in the current environment of polarization and partisanship. But these results suggest that politicians do have some latitude to sway voters' views. Moreover, it doesn't seem likely that voters changed their views due to raw political tribalism. The letters from the lawmakers didn't include information on party affiliation at all. \\"What this points toward is a world where politicians actually have special responsibility to inform the public because they are afforded special trust,\\" Broockman said. \\"The costs associated with doing the right thing according to their values are not as significant as they think.\\" That \\"special responsibility to inform\\" is a key point. The optimistic takeaway here is that legislators with sincerely-held beliefs have some power to bring constituents over to their side. But the flipside is that demagoguery may be more politically potent than previously assumed. For instance, Sarah Palin sold many voters on the false notion of Obamacare \\"death panels\\" as far back as 2009. Five years later, 34 percent of voters still believe in them.

Of course no where on the outside of the box does it tell you that you should be at least 5 months pregnant to hear the heartbeat (they do mention it in the instruction booklet once you've opened everything). So I had to wait about 4 weeks. I am now 8 months pregnant and have yet to hear the heartbeat no matter where I position the monitor or how still I lie. I can only pick up stomach noises and my own heartbeat. It's very disappointing. As for the music aspect- the baby doesn't require the microphone to hear so I'm returning this product and using my regular stereo to play music to him- [money] is too much for something I can do for free and the money can better be spent on something that works. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses initial excitement for the product but encounters multiple disappointments throughout their experience, ultimately leading them to return the product and opt for more effective alternatives. The disappointment starts with the lack of information provided on the box regarding the recommended stage of pregnancy for using the product, which is later found in the instruction booklet. This discrepancy leads to a delay in the reviewer's ability to use the device and contributes to the overall negative impression of the product. Furthermore, the reviewer continues to experience ongoing difficulties while attempting to use the product, even when following the provided guidelines. Despite being 8 months pregnant and having tried various positioning methods to detect the baby's heartbeat, the reviewer is only able to pick up their own heartbeat and stomach noises. This inability to fulfill its primary function leaves the reviewer feeling dissatisfied and frustrated. In addition to these crucial issues, the product's music feature is also criticized as being unnecessary and overpriced. The reviewer points out that the baby does not require the microphone to hear music, and they have found a more cost-effective solution by using their regular stereo system. This further emphasizes the product's shortcomings and reinforces the reviewer's decision to return it. In conclusion, the review portrays the product in an unfavorable light due to a series of disappointments faced by the reviewer. These negative experiences encompass confusing product packaging, inadequacy in performing its main function, and the perceived redundancy of supplementary features. The overall verdict is that the product is not worth the investment, and the money could be better spent on alternative solutions that meet the user's needs more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Max Amann (24 November 1891 30 March 1957) was a German Nazi official with the honorary rank of \\"SS-Obergruppenführer\\", politician and journalist. - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich.

Nelson was the pitcher.. (2). Ryan was the pitcher..","completion":"Nelson used the new baseballs at the field to throw at Ryan because Nelson was the pitcher. Nelson, a tall, lanky young man with a passion for baseball, had recently joined a local baseball team, the Thunderbolts. As a naturally gifted athlete, he quickly earned the position of the team's pitcher, showcasing exceptional skills and precision. He dedicated countless hours to honing his pitching technique and mastering various pitches to ensure that he could fulfill his role to the best of his ability. In particular, he focused on perfecting his fastball, curveball, and slider. As the summer sun shone down on the field, casting a warm glow over the neatly manicured green grass, Nelson enthusiastically took advantage of the new baseballs provided by the team's management. Each shiny, white leather ball seemed to hold the promise of potential, waiting to be hurled across the field in a display of Nelson's talent. Standing a few meters away from Nelson in the batter's box was Ryan. Ryan was a formidable opponent – the Thunderbolts' star batter and a highly skilled player in his own right. With his chiseled jaw, broad shoulders, and a steely determination in his eyes, he exuded confidence and prowess in every aspect of the game. His unwavering focus on improving his swing and hand-eye coordination made him a force to be reckoned with on the field. Nelson and Ryan formed an intriguing duo – the pitcher and the batter – locked in a fierce, yet symbiotic competition. As Nelson prepared to throw each new baseball across the field, their shared goal was not only to outperform each other but also to constantly challenge and encourage each other to reach new heights. With a mighty windup, Nelson unleashed a flurry of lightning-fast pitches, each calculated to test the limits of Ryan's batting skills. The balls whizzed through the air, leaving only a faint white trail in their wake as Ryan swung his bat with furious determination, trying to make contact. The steel of the bat cut through the air, sometimes with a satisfying crack as it connected solidly with a ball, and other times leaving a lingering, anticipatory silence. Nelson continuously adjusted the speed, angle, and spin of his pitches, allowing Ryan to adapt to each new challenge presented to him. This unique and evolving dynamic between the pitcher and the batter showcased the intricate dance that lies at the heart of the game of baseball. It wasn't just a game – It was a testament to the hard work, discipline, and determination of two athletes who were searching for greatness on the field. In this snapshot of time, Nelson and Ryan's respective roles as pitcher and batter presented a perfect tableau of the game they both loved and shared. Each new baseball thrown at the field was a testament to their dedication to the sport – a dedication that would lead them to push the boundaries of their abilities and continue the enduring legacy of baseball. And on this warm summer day, as the golden sun cast its soft, permeating light upon them, Nelson and Ryan were nothing short of unstoppable."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Both Funimation and Crunchyroll simulcast the series on their respective websites, and Funimation began releasing the series on North American home video in 2014. The anime has been licensed in the UK by Manga Entertainment. Madman Entertainment acquired the show for distribution in Australia and New Zealand. The final episode was also aired in Japanese theaters. The anime had some production issues with needing more animators with Wit Studios' character designer, Kyoji Asano tweeting and looking for active animators to work on the anime. An OVA version of the \`\`Ilse's Notebook'' special chapter from tankōbon volume 5 was originally scheduled to be released on August 9, 2013, bundled with the volume 11 limited edition, but was postponed and included with a limited edition of volume 12, released on December 9, 2013, instead. The OVA was bundled on subtitled DVD with the English limited edition release of the 17th manga volume, released on December 1, 2015. A second OVA was released on April 9, 2014, bundled with the 13th volume of the series, this one focused on the members of the 104th Training Corps. Two additional OVA episodes, based on the Attack on Titan: No Regrets prequel manga, were bundled with the 15th and 16th volumes of the main series, released on December 9, 2014 and April 9, 2015, respectively. The anime previously aired on Adult Swim's Toonami block.

Can we conclude that is attack on titan manga the same as the anime? Available options: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"B). yes. The Attack on Titan anime is an adaptation of the manga series of the same name, which means the storylines, characters, and overall themes in both the manga and the anime are the same. However, there might be some differences in details, pacing, and presentation between the two mediums due to the adaptations made by the production team and the studio. Wit Studio, the animation studio behind the adaptation, has closely followed the source material – the manga, to create an anime experience that is faithful to the original work. In some instances, the anime might expand upon or condense certain events from the manga to fit the format of a television series. Moreover, the anime might include additional elements, such as visuals, music, and voice acting, which contribute to the overall experience and storytelling that cannot be provided by the manga. While there might be some minor differences between the Attack on Titan manga and anime series, the overall story, characters, and thematic elements are the same. This means that fans of the manga can still enjoy the anime as an extension of the original work, and vice versa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What territories were not conquered by the Spanish? Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between – essentially Petén and much of Belize – independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.

BBC Wales revealed five Welsh Tory MPs have urged George Osborne to reverse the announcement, made in November. They said the policy change was \\"disrespectful\\" and breached the Conservatives' 2015 election manifesto. But Cardiff North MP Craig Williams said there was no \\"big row\\" and AMs needed \\"some fiscal responsibility\\". Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said devolving income tax powers would mean \\"better government for Wales\\". Some of the MPs opposed to the move hope to raise the issue at a meeting with Mr Osborne on Wednesday. The five - Byron Davies, Chris Davies, David Davies, James Davies and David Jones - have written to him on the issue \\"This is a line in the sand for many of us,\\" one MP said. Another said it would be \\"very embarrassing\\" for the Conservative UK government if almost half of the party's 11 Welsh MPs were to vote against the measure. The letter said that during the general election campaign Tory candidates \\"were able to reassure people that the assembly would not get tax raising powers without the consent of the people of Wales\\". \\"To drop the commitment to a referendum would put us in breach of a clear manifesto commitment,\\" it continued. The Welsh Conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election made reference to an \\"expectation that the Welsh government will hold a referendum on income tax powers\\". The five MPs said people in Wales should not be \\"treated differently in this respect from the people of Scotland, who did have a separate vote on the issue of tax varying powers\\" in the 1997 referendum on devolution. \\"We frankly feel that to impose such powers without a referendum would be disrespectful to the Welsh people,\\" they added. Mr Williams responded: \\"You're going to have cases with business rates being devolved to areas like Manchester, where Manchester City Council might have more fiscal responsibility than the entire Welsh nation,\\" Mr Williams said. \\"It's about time they [the assembly] had some responsibility for income of money as well as spending it on their pet projects.\\" In December, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he thought public opinion was \\"fluid\\" on the matter, but there were \\"very, very strong reasons for why we need to press ahead\\" for Wales and the Welsh economy to get stronger. Splits within the Welsh Conservative group in Cardiff Bay on the devolution of income tax led to the party's leader Andrew RT Davies sacking four members of his front bench team in February 2014. They were re-instated in the summer. Mr Davies said he would use income tax powers to take 5p off the higher rate and 1p off the basic rate in Wales if he was first minister. A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said: \\"The position of the UK government and chancellor is very clear on this matter and we have long called for the Welsh government to be more accountable for the money it raises and spends.\\" A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: \\"This latest development shows the Tories' true colours when it comes to empowering Wales. \\"They support transferring substantial powers, including policing, to English cities without a referendum and yet are trying to block Wales having powers over small proportion of income tax which could be of benefit to the Welsh economy.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article reports that five Welsh Conservative MPs have urged George Osborne to reverse an announcement made in November about devolving income tax powers to Wales.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Christopher Knight was only 20 years old when he walked away from society, not to be seen again for more than a quarter of a century. He had been working for less than a year installing home and vehicle alarm systems near Boston, Massachusetts, when abruptly, without giving notice to his boss, he quit his job. He never even returned his tools. He cashed his final pay cheque and left town. Knight did not tell anyone where he was going. “I had no one to tell,” he says. “I didn’t have any friends. I had no interest in my co-workers.” He drove down the east coast of America, eating fast food and staying in cheap motels – “the cheapest I could find”. He travelled for days, alone, until he found himself deep into Florida, sticking mostly to major roads, watching the world go by. Eventually, he turned around and headed north. He listened to the radio. Ronald Reagan was president; the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had just occurred. Driving through Georgia and the Carolinas and Virginia, blessed with invincibility of youth, buzzed by “the pleasure of driving”, he sensed an idea growing into a realisation, then solidifying into resolve. All his life, he had been comfortable being alone. Interacting with others was so often frustrating. Every meeting with another person seemed like a collision. He drove north to Maine, where he had grown up. There aren’t many roads in the centre of the state, and he chose the one that went right by his family’s house. “I think it was just to have one last look around, to say goodbye,” he said. He didn’t stop. The last time he saw his family home was through the windscreen of his car. He kept going, “up and up and up”. Soon he reached the shore of Moosehead Lake, the largest in Maine, and the point where the state begins to get truly remote. “I drove until I was nearly out of gas. I took a small road. Then a small road off that small road. Then a trail off that.” He went as far into the wilderness as his vehicle could take him. Knight parked the car and tossed the keys on the centre console. He had a tent and a backpack but no compass, no map. Without knowing where he was going, with no particular place in mind, he stepped into the trees and walked away.

The act had elements of a suicide, except he didn’t kill himself. “To the rest of the world, I ceased to exist,” said Knight. Following his disappearance, Knight’s family must have suffered; they had no idea what had happened to him, and couldn’t completely accept the idea that he might be dead. His final gesture, leaving his keys in the car, was particularly strange. Knight was raised with a keen appreciation of the value of money, and the car was the most expensive item he had ever purchased. Why not hold on to the keys as a safety net? What if he didn’t like camping out? “The car was of no use to me. It had just about zero gas and I was miles and miles from any gas station,” he said. As far as anyone knows, the car is still there, half-swallowed by the forest. Knight said that he didn’t really know why he left. He had given the question plenty of thought but had never arrived at a specific answer. “It’s a mystery,” he declared. There have been hermits – also known as recluses, monks, misanthropes, ascetics, anchorites, swamis – at all times in recorded history, across all cultures. But there are really only three general reasons why people leave the world. Most do so for religious purposes, to forge a closer bond with a higher power. Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha all spent significant time alone before introducing a new religion to the world. In Hindu philosophy, everyone ideally matures into a kind of hermit, and today at least four million people live as wandering holy men in India, surviving off the charity of strangers, having renounced all familial and material attachments. Other hermits opt out of civilisation because of a hatred of what the world has become – too much war, or environmental destruction, or crime, or consumerism. The first great literary work about solitude, the Tao Te Ching, was written in China in the sixth century BC by a hermit named Laozi, who was protesting the corrupt state of society. The Tao Te Ching says that it is only through retreat rather than pursuit, through inaction rather than action, that we acquire wisdom. Christopher Knight: inside the Maine hermit's lair Read more The final category includes those who wish to be alone for reasons of artistic freedom, scientific insight or deeper self-understanding. Henry David Thoreau went to Walden Pond in Massachusetts to journey within, to explore “the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one’s being”. English historian Edward Gibbon said that “solitude was the school for genius”. Knight fit into none of these categories – he did not follow any formal religion; he was not protesting modern society; he produced no artwork or philosophical treatise. He never took a photograph or wrote a sentence; not a single person knew where he was. His back was fully turned to the world. There was no clear reason for what he chose to do. Something he couldn’t quite pinpoint had tugged him away from the world with the persistence of gravity. He was one of the longest‑enduring solitaries in history, and among the most fervent as well. Christopher Knight was a true hermit. “I can’t explain my actions,” he said. “I had no plans when I left, I wasn’t thinking of anything. I just did it.” Knight’s goal was to get lost. Not just lost to the rest of the world but actually lost in the woods by himself. He carried only rudimentary camping supplies, a few articles of clothing and a little food. “I had what I had,” he said, “and nothing more.” It is not easy to get truly lost. Anyone with basic outdoor skills generally knows which way they are heading. The sun burns west across the sky, and from there it is natural to set the other directions. Knight knew that he was heading south. He said that he didn’t make a conscious decision to do so. Instead, he felt pulled in that direction, like a homing pigeon. “There was no depth or substance to the idea. It was at the instinctual level. It’s instinct among animals to return to home territory, and my home ground, where I was born and raised, was that way.” Maine is partitioned into a series of long north-south valleys, the geologic clawmark left by glaciers surging and retreating. Separating the valleys are strings of mountains, now weather-worn and bald-topped like old men. The valley floors at the time of year when Knight arrived were a summer soup of ponds and wetlands and bogs. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A television found at Christopher Knight’s camp. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Getty Images “I kept largely to the ridges,” Knight said, “and sometimes crossed swamps going from one ridge to another.” He worked his way along crumbled slopes and muddy wetlands. “Soon I lost track of where I was. I didn’t care.” He would camp in one spot for a week or so, then head south yet again. “I kept going,” he said. “I was content in the choice I had made.” Content except for one thing: food. Knight was hungry, and he really didn’t know how he would feed himself. His departure from the outside world was a confounding mix of incredible commitment and complete lack of forethought – not all that strange for a 20-year-old. It was as if he went camping for the weekend and then didn’t come home for a quarter of a century. He was an able hunter and angler, but he took neither a gun nor a rod with him. Still, he didn’t want to die, at least not then. Knight’s idea was to forage. The wilds of Maine are monumentally broad, though not generous. There are no fruit trees. Berries sometimes have a weekend-long season. Without hunting or trapping or fishing, a person is going to starve. Knight worked his way south, eating very little, until paved roads appeared. He found a road-killed partridge, but did not possess a stove or a way to easily start a fire, so he ate it raw. Neither a tasty meal nor a hearty one, and a good way to get sick. He passed houses with gardens, but was raised with rigid morals and a great deal of pride. You make do on your own, always. No handouts or government assistance, ever. You know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the dividing line is usually clear. But try not eating for 10 days – nearly everyone’s restraints will be eroded. Hunger is hard to ignore. “It took a while to overcome my scruples,” Knight said, but as soon as his principles began to fall away, he snapped off a few ears of corn from one garden, dug up some potatoes from another, and ate a couple of green vegetables. Once, during his first weeks away, he spent the night in an unoccupied cabin. It was a miserable experience. “The stress of that, the sleepless worry about getting caught, programmed me not to do that again.” Knight never slept indoors after that, not once, no matter how cold or rainy the weather. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Knight’s camp. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Getty Images He continued moving south, picking through gardens, and eventually reached a region with a familiar distribution of trees, along with a diversity of birdcalls and a temperature range he felt accustomed to. It had been colder up north. Knight wasn’t sure precisely where he was, but he knew that it was home ground. It turned out that he was less than 30 miles, as the crow flies, from his childhood home. In the early days, nearly everything Knight learned was through trial and error. He had been gifted with a good head for figuring out workable solutions to complicated problems. All his skills, from the rigging of the tarps that formed his shelter, to how to store drinking water, to walking through the forest without leaving tracks, went through multiple revisions and were never considered perfect. Tinkering with his systems was one of Knight’s hobbies. Over the next few months, Knight tried living in several places in the area – including inside a dank hole in a riverbank – all without satisfaction. Finally, he stumbled upon a region of nasty, boulder-choked woods without so much as a game trail running through it; far too harsh for hikers. He liked it immediately. Then he discovered a cluster of boulders, one with a hidden opening that led to a tiny, wondrous clearing. “I knew at once it was ideal. So I settled in.” Still, he remained hungry. Knight was beginning to realise that is almost impossible to live by yourself all the time. You need help. Hermits across history often ended up in deserts or mountains or woodlands – the sorts of places where it was extremely difficult to find or catch all your own food. To feed themselves, some of the Desert Fathers – third-century Christian Hermits from Egypt – wove reed baskets and sold them. In ancient China, hermits were shamans, herbalists and diviners. Later, a fad for hermits swept 18th-century England. It was believed that hermits radiated kindness and thoughtfulness, so advertisements were placed in newspapers for “ornamental hermits” who were lax in grooming and willing to sleep in caves on the country estates of the aristocracy. The job paid well and hundreds were hired, typically on seven-year contracts. Some of the hermits would even emerge at dinner parties and greet guests. Knight, however, felt that anyone’s willing assistance tainted the whole enterprise. He wished to be unconditionally alone; an uncontacted tribe of one. The cabins around the ponds in central Maine, Knight noted, had minimal security measures. Windows were often left open, even when the owners were away. The woods offered excellent cover, and with few permanent residents, the area would always be empty during the off-season. A summer camp with a big pantry was nearby. The easiest way to become a hunter-gatherer here was obvious. And so Knight decided to steal. To commit a thousand break-ins before getting caught, a world-class streak, requires precision and patience, daring and luck. It also demands a specific understanding of people. “I looked for patterns,” Knight said. “Everyone has patterns.” He perched at the edge of the woods and meticulously observed the habits of the families with cabins along the ponds. He watched their quiet breakfasts and dinner parties, their visitors and vacancies, the cars moving up and down the road. Nothing Knight saw tempted him to return to his former life. His surveillance was clinical, informational, mathematical. He did not learn anyone’s name. All he sought was to understand migration patterns – when people went shopping, when a cabin was unoccupied. After that, he said, everything in his life became a matter of timing. The ideal time to steal was deep in the night, midweek, preferably when it was overcast, best in the rain. A heavy downpour was prime. People stayed out of the woods when it was wet. Still, Knight did not walk on roads or trails, just in case, and he never launched a raid on a Friday or Saturday – days he knew had arrived from the obvious surge in lakeside noise. For a while, he opted to go out when the moon was large, so he could use it as a light source. In later years, when he suspected the police had intensified their search for him, he switched to no moon at all. Knight liked to vary his methods. He didn’t want to develop any patterns of his own, though he did make it a habit to embark on a raid only when freshly shaved or with a neatly groomed beard, and wearing clean clothing, so as to reduce suspicion on the slight chance that he was spotted. There were at least 100 cabins in Knight’s thieving repertoire. The ideal was a fully stocked place, with the family away until the weekend. He knew, in many cases, the precise number of steps required to reach a particular cabin, and once he selected a target, he bounded and weaved through the forest. Sometimes, if he was headed far or needed a load of propane or a replacement mattress it was easier to travel by canoe. Canoes are difficult to hide, and if you steal one, the owner will call the police. It was wiser to borrow, and there was a large selection around the lake, some up on sawhorses and seldom used. Knight was capable of reaching homes anywhere along the largest pond near his hidden campsite. “I’d think nothing of paddling for hours, whatever needed to be done.” If the water was choppy, he would place a few rocks in the front of the boat to keep it stable. Typically, he stayed close to shore, cloaked against the trees, hiding in the silhouette of the land, though on a stormy night he would paddle across the middle, alone in the dark and lashed by the rain. When he arrived at his chosen cabin, he would make sure there were no vehicles in the driveway, no sign of someone inside. Burglary is a dicey business, with a low margin for error. One mistake and the outside world would snatch him back. So he crouched in the dark and waited, sometimes for hours. “I enjoy being in the dark,” he said. He never risked breaking into a home occupied year-round, and he always wore a watch so he could monitor the time. Sometimes, cabins were left unlocked. Those were the easiest to enter, though soon other places became nearly as simple. Knight had keys to them, found during previous break-ins. He stashed each key on its respective property, typically under some nondescript rock. He created several dozen of these stashes and never forgot where one was. He noticed when several cabins left out pens and paper, requesting a shopping list, and others offered him bags of supplies, hanging from a doorknob. But he was fearful of traps, or tricks, or initiating any sort of correspondence, even a grocery list. So he left everything untouched, and people stopped. For the majority of his break-ins, Knight worked the lock on a window or door. He always carried his lock-breaking kit, a gym bag with a collection of screwdrivers and flat bars and files, all of which he had stolen, and could defeat all but the most fortified bolts with the perfect little jiggle of just the right tool. When he had finished stealing, he would often reseal the hasp on the window he had unlatched and exit through the front door, making sure the handle was set, if possible, to lock up behind himself. No need to leave the place vulnerable to thieves. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The bow of a canoe on Lang Pond in Maine’s Northern Forest. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo As the local residents invested in security upgrades, Knight adapted. He knew about alarms from his one paying job, and he used this knowledge to continue stealing – sometimes disabling systems or removing memory cards from surveillance cameras. He evaded dozens of attempts to catch him, by both police officers and private citizens. The crime scenes he left behind were so clean that the authorities offered their begrudging respect. “The level of discipline he showed while he broke into houses,” said one police officer, “is beyond what any of us can remotely imagine – the legwork, the reconnaissance, the talent with locks, his ability to get in and out without being detected.” A burglary report filed by another officer specifically noted the crime’s “unusual neatness”. The hermit, many officers felt, was a master thief. It was as if he were showing off, picking locks yet stealing little, playing a strange sort of game. Knight said the moment he opened a lock and entered a home, he always felt a hot wave of shame. “Every time, I was very conscious that I was doing wrong. I took no pleasure in it, none at all.” Once inside a cabin, he moved purposefully, hitting the kitchen first before making a quick sweep of the house, looking for any useful items, or the batteries he always required. He never turned on a light. He used only a small torch attached to a metal chain he wore around his neck. During a burglary, there wasn’t a moment’s ease. “My adrenaline was spiking, my heart rate was soaring. My blood pressure was high. I was always scared when stealing. Always. I wanted it over as quickly as possible.” When Knight was finished with the inside of the cabin, he would habitually check the gas grill to see if the propane tank was full. If so, and there was an empty spare lying around, he would replace the full one with an empty, making the grill appear untouched. Then he would load everything into a canoe, if he had borrowed one, and paddle to the shore closest to his camp to unload. He would return the canoe to the spot he had taken it from, sprinkle some pine needles on the boat to make it appear unused, then haul his loot up through the dense woods, between the rocks, to his home. Each raid brought Knight enough supplies to last about two weeks, and as he settled once more into his room in the woods – “back in my safe place, success” – he experienced a deep sense of peace. Knight said that he couldn’t accurately describe what it felt like to spend such an immense period of time alone. Silence does not translate into words. “It’s complicated,” he said. “Solitude bestows an increase in something valuable. I can’t dismiss that idea. Solitude increased my perception. But here’s the tricky thing: when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for. There was no need to define myself. I became irrelevant.” The dividing line between himself and the forest, Knight said, seemed to dissolve. His isolation felt more like a communion. “My desires dropped away. I didn’t long for anything. I didn’t even have a name. To put it romantically, I was completely free.” Virtually everyone who has tried to describe deep solitude has said something similar. “I am nothing; I see all,” wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. Lord Byron called it “the feeling infinite”. The American mystic Thomas Merton said that “the true solitary does not seek himself, but loses himself”. For those who do not choose to be alone – like prisoners and hostages – a loss of one’s socially created identity can be terrifying, a plunge into madness. Psychologists call it “ontological insecurity”, losing your grip on who you are. Edward Abbey, in Desert Solitaire, a chronicle of two six‑month stints as a ranger in Utah’s Arches National Monument, said that being solitary for a long time “means risking everything human”. Knight, meanwhile, didn’t even keep a mirror in his camp. He was never once bored. He wasn’t sure, he said, that he even understood the concept of boredom. “I was never lonely,” Knight added. He was attuned to the completeness of his own presence rather than to the absence of others. “If you like solitude,” he said, “you are never alone.” Knight was finally arrested, after 27 years of complete isolation, while stealing food at a lakeside summer camp. He was charged with burglary and theft, and taken to the local jail. His arrest caused an enormous commotion – letters and visitors arrived at the jail, and approximately 500 journalists requested an interview. A documentary film team showed up. A woman proposed marriage. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Knight is escorted into Kennebec County Superior Court to enter pleas for multiple burglaries and thefts. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Press Herald via Getty Images Everyone wanted to know what the hermit would say. What insights had he gained while he was alone? What advice did he have for the rest of us? People have been approaching hermits with similar requests for thousands of years, eager to consult with someone whose life has been so radically different to their own. Profound truths, or at least those that make sense of the seeming randomness of life, are difficult to find. Thoreau wrote that he had reduced his existence to its basic elements so that he could “live deep and suck out all the marrow of life”. Knight did, eventually permit one journalist to meet him, and over the course of nine one-hour visits in the jail, the hermit shared his life story – about how he was able to survive, and what it felt like to live alone for so long. And once, when he was in an especially introspective mood, Knight seemed willing, despite his typical aversion to dispensing wisdom, to share more of what he gleaned while alone. Was there, the journalist asked him, some grand insight revealed to him in the wild? Knight sat quietly but he eventually arrived at a reply. “Get enough sleep,” he said. He set his jaw in a way that conveyed he wouldn’t be saying any more. This was what he’d learned. It was, without question, the truth. This is an adapted extract of The Stranger in the Woods by Michael Finkel, published by Simon and Schuster • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here ||||| I wanted to read this book as the Maine woods have been a part of my life and I was unfamiliar with this story until I saw this book. I realized from the start that at the core of this story was an important topic I already have been worrying about that I feel American society either is unaware of or is purposefully ignoring: the neuro-atypical person and the challenge of how they will live (not thriving but suffering) in modern America. I found the book a page turner from the start. I did sneak to the Internet as I was dying to know more and found many videos online such as press conferences with the investigating local law enforcement and video of the now-disassembled camp site. The story was written in a way that was engaging and it moved at a pace that was just right. It's a short 201 pages and the personal details were provided in just nine hours of interviewing, limited by the \\"hermit's\\" choice to tell only so much and no more, keeping some things private, and sharing his opinions that are sometimes short and blunt (not pontificating). This is the story of a man who walked into the Maine woods with a small number of items who chose to live in seclusion, robbing lakeside summer camps (vacation cabins) for food and basic supplies. With no military or survivalist training other than reading trade books such as the Foxfire series, he devised systems and carved a llife that allowed him to live for 27 years in the brutal Maine woods, sometimes in 20+ below zero winter weather. He only interacted with other people twice, once saying just \\"hi\\" to a hiker and once with hand movements and body language only. Knight was content and found peace in living that life until he was caught with the help of sophisticated surveillance equipment while robbing food from a nonprofit camp for disabled children (including kids on the Autism Spectrum). While telling the story of Christopher Knight's life as a hermit, Finkel weaves in his research on the related topics of voluntary solitude versus loneliness, the brain and what scientific studies have told us about the human need for social connection, the role of hormones, and about various (supposed) disorders that our society has invented and given names to. To a layperson Knight seems to have Asperger's, but that's a diagnosis that now no longer exists, it's been renamed and grouped under the broader umbrella term Autism Spectrum Disorder. From my own reading of the book Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnosis of Gifted Children and Adults by James Webb et al I wonder if Knight's IQ is one that is so high that other neuro-atypical elements also are present. In the book it was said that doctors refused to make a diagnosis of Asperger's because Knight was too high functioning in daily life to qualify for the diagnosis. The heartbreaking part of this story is that the suffering that Knight endured was due to square pegs not fitting in the round holes of modern American society, his relief and contendedness was found living in isolation in nature, but this is not really allowed in America, and when possible it's only available to those who are able to financially support themselves due to an inheritance or some income stream that they are lucky to find that meshes with their talents and abilities. Also explored in the book was how other cultures around the world have places for hermit-types to go and to live supported for their basic need for food and shelter by society (not financially self-sufficient). Prior to the disassembling of the asylums in the United States, perhaps some of the residents were those who were square pegs. If you just want to hear the story of who, what, when, where, why and how, all that is here in a short easy read. I finished it off in under 48 hours reading between living my regular life. I could have finished it in one sitting if I wanted to stay up too late or clear my calendar for a morning. But this book provides more food for thought, for me at least, than just Knight's hermit years story. I hope this book is a catalyst for Americans to think about this issue, with the rising rates of Autism and mental illness, we have more people this decade than ever before who are not fitting in with the mandatory American public school system and who are not fitting in to work jobs as adults enough to support themselves independently let alone the issue of if a person is happy or content. When a person suffers now they are labeled as depressed, if they worry too much, they have anxiety. The rise in the use of psychiatric medications to try to help people who are not fitting in with American society's defined \\"right way to function and be\\" is not always successful in converting a person into being something we call cured. We don't just let people be, anyone found to be atypical is trying to be fixed. If relatives take in a family member with what we call a disability or mental illness, the cost of living can be so high that it's hard to afford it. This societal problem is going to get worse in the upcoming decades. But I digress. This book is a great read that informs and it was written with respect and portrays Knight with dignity. It's not sensationalized for entertainment purposes and it's not patronizing (thank goodness). Rating 5 stars = Love It. This NEEDS TO BE MADE INTO A MOVIE so it can reach a wider audience and that income perhaps can support Knight's ability to live the kind of life he needs to feel inner peace and contentment. |||||Summary:","completion":"Christopher Knight, a 20-year-old man, decided to leave society and live alone in the forests of Maine.

Closing out the first half was a 3-yard TD pass from Favre to wide receiver Bernard Berrian to make a 21-0 Vikings halftime lead, the first time of the season the Vikings kept their opponent scoreless in the first half. In the third quarter, the Vikings continued to dominate as Favre found wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 7-yard TD pass. Seattle scored their first points of the game when kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 40-yard field goal. Finally, the Vikings put the game away as second-string QB Tarvaris Jackson found Rice again on a 34-yard TD pass. The Seahawks tried to rally with a 1-yard TD run by running back Justin Forsett (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Vikings prevented the Seahawks comeback from advancing any further. With the win, the Vikings improved to 9-1. Brett Favre threw 4 TD passes for the 22nd time in his career (second of the season), breaking the mark set by Dan Marino.

A school at the centre of the Islamist ‘Trojan Horse’ takeover plot has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The report - made public yesterday but. leaked to the Daily Mail on Monday - revealed Golden Hillock, in Birmingham,. was doing 'too little to keep students safe from the risks associated. with extremist views'. It was placed in special measures after. Ofsted noted ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex. and relationships education was not taught properly. Denial: Golden Hillock school (pictured) has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The charges were rejected as politically motivated. The charges have been rejected by the school’s management as being. politically motivated. A statement from the school said it disputed the. validity of the inspection. Golden. Hillock secondary school in Sparkbrook is one of three managed by the. Park View Educational Trust - all of which are believed to have been. rated inadequate. A. Trust spokesman said Ofsted found no evidence that Golden Hillock. either promoted or tolerated extremism or radicalisation. It added it. did not accept Ofsted findings that the school was inadequate.’ It. said: 'The Trust does not accept the findings of the Ofsted report,. which mischaracterises the school, and is now challenging it through the. appropriate legal channels.' Golden. Hillock was one of 21 schools inspected after a letter - now widely. believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims. to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation. Trojan Horse. The. Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to. council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked. several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council,. West Midlands Police, the Department for Education and Ofsted. In. its statement, PVET, said it believed that the inspections had been. conducted 'in a climate of fear created by the 'Trojan Horse' letter'. Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons. Inspectors. who visited Golden Hillock concluded that the school was not doing. enough to raise students' awareness of 'risks of extremism', according. to PVET's statement. But. the Trust said it was crucial to note that Ofsted's report contained no. suggestion, or evidence, that the school either promotes or tolerates. extremism or radicalisation. It added. that it disputed the inspectorate's finding that there had been slow. progress in ensuring that staff had been trained in recognising the. signs of radicalisation and how to tailor their teaching to counter. this. And it claimed a finding that students are not being properly prepared for life in modern Britain was a 'misrepresentation'. It said: 'On behalf of the staff, students and parents who have worked so hard to improve their school, we are extremely disappointed to confirm that Ofsted has decided to place Golden Hillock in special measures.' Education: Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of Trojan Horse plots since 2010. 'While we support the role of Ofsted in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way, we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings. Golden Hillock is categorically not an inadequate school. It is also crucial to note that the school had been part of Park View Educational Trust for just five months at the time of the Ofsted inspection in March 2014. 'A number of the judgments are based on data and information that pre-date the Trust's involvement.' PVET runs three schools, including Park View Academy which has been at the centre of some of the most serious allegations. In the past, Trust chairman Tahir Alam has called the allegations 'a witch-hunt.' Earlier this week, it was revealed that three other schools inspected by Ofsted had been given a clean bill of health. The Birmingham-based schools published letters received from the watchdog which all found governance and leadership to be either good or outstanding - the highest rating available - and concluding that child-safeguarding standards were being met. Ninestiles School - an academy in Acocks Green - Small Heath School and Washwood Heath Academy were the first to publish the results of their inspections, after Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations. A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Gender discrimination, undue influence of extremist views, the school curriculum influenced by hard-line beliefs. This report confirms that Michael Gove can no longer seek to distance himself from this episode. He is responsible.' 'In 2010, Michael Gove was warned by a highly respected Birmingham headteacher that this was going on. Four years on, he has failed to act and has not explained why.' 'Rightly, his record is now being called into question. Rather than rowing with Theresa May, he needs to answer why he has refused to act.'

The premise mentions a woman who is standing on a beach and specifies that she is wearing a bathing suit. A bathing suit, also known as swimwear, is a type of clothing designed specifically for swimming or taking part in water-based activities. It typically comes in various forms, such as one-piece suits or bikinis for women. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the woman is wearing a dress. A dress is a garment that is distinct from a bathing suit. It is typically a one-piece outfit made of various materials, designed to be worn from the shoulders to any length below the hips. Dresses are usually worn on social occasions or as part of everyday attire, depending on the style of the dress and the cultural context. Given the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not supported or proven to be true based on the information provided in the premise. The premise clearly states that the woman is wearing a bathing suit, which is distinctly different from a dress. Therefore, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true because it specifically contradicts the information in the hypothesis. Additionally, it is important to note that although the details provided in the premise do not directly support the hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is completely false. The woman could possibly change into a dress at a later time or have a dress nearby with intentions of wearing it. However, based on the information given in the premise alone, the hypothesis suggesting that the woman is currently wearing a dress does not correspond with the provided details, making it unsupported by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fine, because I'm tired of this place having such a high rating from fake reviews, I'm going to review my attempt to eat there. We went by last week, walked over there, and the owner was outside.

So Monday rolls around and we are starving by the time we get home from work at 4. We walk over and there are two \\"chefs\\" standing around in the doorway chatting it up while smoking.

No one knew what it was. Now, nobody's saying this is evidence of little green men, but the tape makes for a fun UFO story, clearly. And there's a possible serious side. Even in the likely event that the object has a mundane source, the incident may reveal a potential safety hazard because of its unexpected appearance in the sky.

The pilot's voice reveals his surprise at the question: \\"Over us?\\" The flight control official replied that a pilot in front of the jetliner reported seeing something \\"and we didn't have any targets,\\" meaning it didn't show up on radar. Forty-five seconds went by. \\"Yeah, something just passed over us,\\" the American Airlines pilot then reported. \\"Uh, like a — I don't know what it was, but it was at least two-three thousand feet above us. Yeah, it passed right over the top of us.\\" A moment later, Albuquerque Center asks the pilot to describe what he saw. \\"Can you tell us if it was in motion, or just hovering?\\" The pilot said he couldn't make it out, but the object had a \\"big reflection,\\" was flying \\"several thousand feet above us\\" and going \\"in the opposite direction.\\" A few seconds later, someone asked the pilot, \\"was it a Google balloon?\\" \\"Doubtful,\\" he replied. \\"UFO!\\" someone quipped.

Two airline pilots spotted a mysterious, reflective object hovering some 40,000 feet (12,000 meters) over southern Arizona last month, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is stumped. According to radio transmissions between the befuddled pilots and air traffic controllers (which you can listen to in full, thanks to an FAA recording recently released to the Phoenix New Times), the sighting occurred around 3:30 p.m. local time on Feb. 24, somewhere over the Sonoran Desert near Phoenix. \\"Was anybody above us that passed us like 30 seconds ago?\\" the first pilot asked while flying a Learjet west toward California.

A few minutes later, the FAA asked another nearby flight — an American Airlines Airbus traveling in the same direction — to keep an eye out for anything \\"passing over\\" it in the desert. The confused pilot agreed. And sure enough, within a few minutes, the Airbus crew saw the same mystery object fly over their plane. \\"Yeah, something just passed over us,\\" the Airbus pilot reported. \\"I couldn't make it out, whether it was a balloon or what … but it had a big reflection on it and it was several thousand feet above us, going the opposite direction.\\" Several weeks later, authorities are still stumped as to the object's origin. Beyond these two pilot reports, the FAA couldn't verify that any other aircraft were around. It likely wasn't a \\"Google balloon,\\" the FAA reported, nor a weather balloon or a military craft. \\"We have a close working relationship with a number of other agencies and safely handle military aircraft and civilian aircraft of all types in that area every day, including high-altitude weather balloons,\\" an FAA representative told the New Times. In other words, whatever the UFO was, the FAA should have known about it. But it didn't.

Recently, I decided to visit the Shutter Falls Restaurant, having heard of its popularity and its 'unique' approach to dining. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share my concerns in this detailed negative review. 1. Ambience: To begin with, the ambience of Shutter Falls did not live up to the high standards I was expecting from such a well-known establishment. The interior appeared dimly lit and shabby; draped curtains and poorly spaced seating arrangements made the whole place seem cluttered. Furthermore, the music was obnoxiously loud, making it difficult to have any meaningful conversation with my dining partner. 2. Service: The service was nothing short of abysmal. After being seated, we had to wait for almost 15 minutes just to have our orders taken, despite the restaurant being only half full. The waitstaff seemed untrained and disinterested. They barely made any eye contact and were unresponsive to our requests for recommendations. Additionally, once we placed our orders, it took a good 40 minutes for our food to arrive, which was unacceptable. 3. Food Quality: When our dishes finally arrived, the presentation was lackluster, to say the least. One would expect a restaurant of Shutter Falls' stature to pay careful attention to the plating, which sadly was far from the case. To make matters worse, the taste of the dishes left much to be desired. The Chicken Alfredo we ordered was bland, lacking any flavor or seasoning, while the steak was overcooked, making it tough and chewy. The side dishes were equally disappointing, with undercooked potatoes and a lifeless salad. 4. Price: Honestly, given the quality of the food and service we experienced at Shutter Falls, the prices were outrageously high. We ended up spending close to 100 for a meal that was neither satisfying nor enjoyable. Had the food and service been exceptional, this price point may have been justified, but given the circumstances, it felt like a downright rip-off. 5. Hygiene: During our time at the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how unkempt the place was. The dining area had a musty smell, while the restroom was far from clean. I witnessed a staff member walk out of the restroom without washing her hands, which only deepened my concerns regarding the overall hygiene and safety practices followed at Shutter Falls. In conclusion, my experience at the Shutter Falls Restaurant was decidedly negative. With a disorganized ambience, subpar service, abysmal food quality, inflated prices, and questionable hygiene standards, I regret to say that I will not be recommending this establishment to anyone. Despite the hype and popularity it may have gathered, my time at Shutter Falls was marked by disappointment and discomfort. There are many other fine dining options in the city that offer much better value for money, and I will be turning to those establishments in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude.

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - Christian IV (12 April 1577 28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648. His 59-year reign is the longest of Danish monarchs, and of Scandinavian monarchies. - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk.

It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals. - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938). - A personal union is the combination of two or more states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch. - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\". - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Akershus Fortress or Akershus Castle is a medieval castle that was built to protect Oslo, the capital of Norway. It has also been used as a prison. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger.

From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015 25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066.

Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Norse Energy ( OSE : NEC ) is a petroleum and natural gas exploration and production as well as pipeline operator .

The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored. - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast.

The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars: - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north.

Plot title: Dumbo Movie plot: As a circus train makes it's way to the first of many show stops, a stork arrives with a baby for one elephant, named Mrs Jumbo. The other female pachyderms are charmed by the little baby, until he sneezes, revealing that he has a pair of oversized ears. Their words take on a different tune as they make fun of the little baby, giving him the ridiculing name of Dumbo. Dumbo's Mother just ignores their taunts and still cares for her child.At the circus' first venue, the elephants are put on exhibition for a number of people. However, one young boy makes fun of Dumbo, and also ends up pulling on his ears. This causes Mrs Jumbo to protect her son, but her actions cause the Ringmaster and the other circus people to claim her to be a mad elephant, and she is locked away.After this incident, none of the other elephants show any compassion or want to help Dumbo after his Mother is taken away. The only one who comes to his aid in friendship is a little mouse named Timothy. Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well. Timothy feels that Dumbo just needs to prove himself, and while the Ringmaster is asleep, whispers the idea for an elaborate performance by the elephants.The elephants climb on top of each other, and the plan is for Dumbo to be launched to the top, holding a little flag. However, Dumbo trips over his ears, and ends up toppling the stacked elephants, which causes the circus tent to collapse.After this, Dumbo is given the rather embarrassing role of being painted as a clown, and put into a rather degrading circus act. Dumbo just feels even worse, but Timothy manages to take him to see his Mother, which cheers him up a little. Later on in the evening, Dumbo develops the hiccups, and Timothy finds a tub of water in the clown's tent. However, one of the clowns has knocked some liquor into it, and Dumbo and Timothy end up getting tipsy, and soon start hallucinating, seeing pink...

Answer the following question: Given the following context: From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty's 1936 set. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto? Answer:","completion":"The person who made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto is the composer himself, Sir William Walton.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table. Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? Question: Which is probably true of the author? Options: A. not enough information B. The author is physically fit C. They author is an accountability coach D. The author is controlling === The correct answer is","completion":"A. not enough information It is important to recognize that the diet cycle mentality can be a significant obstacle to achieving long-term weight loss and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It is often rooted in the belief that there is a 'magic cure' or 'one last diet' that will solve all weight-related problems, but, in reality, these are just stories people tell themselves as a way of rationalizing their inability to lose weight and keep it off permanently. To break free from this mentality, it is essential to explore the reasons why these narratives do not hold true and to understand that lasting change and improved health require consistent effort, commitment, and a focus on holistic well-being. This means addressing not only diet but also exercise, stress management, self-care, and emotional health. Instead of relying on quick-fix promises and false beliefs, it can be helpful to cultivate awareness around your eating habits, reflect on your relationship with food, and consider the various factors that influence your choices. This deeper self-inquiry may reveal that addressing the root causes of your weight issues requires more specific strategies tailored to your unique physical and emotional needs. Additionally, working with experts like nutritionists, exercise professionals, and therapists can provide support and guidance on your journey toward a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. Accountability and community can be powerful motivators in helping you stay on track and make lasting changes. Finally, remember that achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. It involves resilience, adaptability, and self-compassion. By acknowledging the inherent flaws of the diet cycle mentality and committing to nurturing healthier habits, you can break free from this exhausting and self-defeating cycle and move toward a life of sustainable well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Vedic period or Vedic age (c. 1500 - c. 600 BCE) is the period in the history of the Indian subcontinent intervening between the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization, and a second urbanisation which began in c. 600 BCE. It gets its name from the Vedas, which are liturgical texts containing details of life during this period that have been interpreted to be historical and constitute the primary sources for understanding the period. The Vedas were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c. 1200 or 1100 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. The commonly accepted period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to the second millennium BCE. After the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which ended c. 1900 BCE, groups of Indo-Aryan peoples migrated into north-western India and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which--according to the most widespread hypothesis--have originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan. Some writers and archaeologists have opposed the notion of a migration of Indo-Aryans into India. Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton used the term \\"Indo-Aryan Controversy\\" for an oversight of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory, and some of its opponents. These ideas are outside the academic mainstream. Mallory and Adams note that two types of models \\"enjoy significant international currency\\" as to the Indo-European homeland, namely the Anatolian hypothesis, and a migration out of the Eurasian steppes. According to Upinder Singh, \\"The original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and Indo-Aryans is the subject of continuing debate among philologists, linguists, historians, archaeologists and others. The dominant view is that the Indo-Aryans came to the subcontinent as immigrants. Another view, advocated mainly by some Indian scholars, is that they were indigenous to the subcontinent.\\" The knowledge about the Aryans comes mostly from the Rigveda-samhita, i. e. the oldest layer of the Vedas, which was composed c. 1500-1200 BCE. They brought with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \\"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\\", which borrowed \\"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\\" from the Bactria-Margiana Culture. Are there specific dates provided for the beginning of the Vedic period?","completion":"Yes, the specific dates provided for the beginning of the Vedic period or Vedic age are around 1500 BCE. This period is marked by the migration of Indo-Aryan peoples into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent following the end of the urban Indus Valley Civilization. The Vedic period continued until around 600 BCE, when a second urbanization began in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's something you don't see every day: The 99% demonstrating in support of the 1%. But that's exactly what's been happening for several weeks all around New England at Market Basket grocery stores. In 1916, Athanasios and Efrosini Demoulas, who immigrated to the United States from Greece, opened a grocery store in Lowell, Massachusetts. Almost a century later, the family has expanded it to a chain of 71 supermarkets across Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. In 2008, Anthanasios and Efrosini's grandson Arthur T. Demoulas was elected president of the Market Basket board. By all accounts, Arthur T., as he is known, presided over a very successful and happy company. Not only did Market Basket continue to expand and reap profits â€” generating 4 billion in revenues in 2012 â€” but workers have thrived as well. Full-time clerks start at 12 an hour. Cashiers with experience can earn over 40,000 a year. And managers can easily make into the six figures. Keep in mind that's in a nation where the average annual salary for grocery store cashiers is 21,370 and the national minimum wage is 7.25 per hour. The company also has a generous retirement plan, matching 15% of annual salary to employee retirement funds. What's more, workers up and down the supply chain receive good bonuses throughout the year. All this and Market Basket is affordable for customers, with prices regularly 10% to 20% lower than competitors. The company is profitable in an industry known for low profit margins, and has given 500 million in dividends to the nine family shareholders over the past decade. In other words, at a time when corporate executives and wealthy investors regularly try to argue that companies cannot pay workers well and be successful in generating profits, Market Basket has been an impressive and stunning example to the contrary. Market Basket has been a good company all around -- until recently, when things changed. So what happened? Well, the family board switched sides, ousted Arthur T. and installed his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas as president. One of the first acts under Arthur S. was to distribute 250 million in profits to the nine family shareholders, what a Boston Globe editorial called \\"an uncharacteristic act of greed for a firm known for its generous treatment of its workers and concern for price-conscious shoppers.\\" There have been other ominous signs that Arthur S. and his allies plan to push profit at all costs -- at the expense of workers and the values of the company. And so in an unprecedented mobilization, managers and workers have protested at Market Baskets across New England, calling for their beloved CEO Artie T. to be reinstated. Last week, more than 6,000 Market Basket workers and managers joined in a peaceful march outside the company's headquarters in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. If you go to any Market Basket store around New England right now, you're likely to find employees and even some customers holding up signs protesting the new executive and supporting the ousted Artie T. Employees are also using social media to get their message out, using hashtags like #MarketBasket. Of course, if you go inside a Market Basket you're not likely to find much; even the warehouse workers are on strike. These protests aren't being organized by unions; after all, Market Basket workers aren't unionized. They're being organized by the employees and managers of the company. Already, eight managers have been fired for helping lead the protests. But the protests continue. As a result, the company is reportedly losing 1 million a day. A reporter interviewed one of the Market Basket workers at a protest. \\"I have a friend who works at Walmart,\\" she said, \\"and I asked her, would they ever do this for their CEO?\\" The woman laughed. But what has become of capitalism in America is not funny: the extreme greed of a few overrunning the best interests of everyone, including workers, communities and a healthy growing economy. Just like the Occupy Wall Street protesters before them, the Market Basket workers are not protesting against capitalism. They're protesting for a certain kind of capitalism, a capitalism that works for owners as well as for workers and communities. It's the kind of capitalism that has made Market Basket a successful business for generations, the kind of capitalism that once meant shared prosperity and opportunity in America. The Market Basket managers and cashiers and bag boys joining in protest aren't just holding signs, they're also holding the aspirations of the majority of Americans. Those of us concerned about the growing economic inequality in America don't want to \\"eat the rich\\" â€” we simply don't want the rich to chew up and spit out everyone else. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Market Basket is a chain of 71 supermarkets in New England, known for treating its workers exceptionally well, with high salaries, good bonuses, and a generous retirement plan. They have managed to be a successful and profitable business with affordable prices for customers despite these employee benefits. However, recently, the company's board ousted Arthur T. Demoulas, a popular president who cared for employee welfare, and installed his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas as president. Under Arthur S., the company has taken actions that are more focused on profits at the expense of the workers and company values. In response, an unprecedented mobilization of employees and managers have been protesting at Market Basket stores across New England, calling for the reinstatement of Arthur T. Demoulas as CEO. This protest is not against capitalism, but rather in support of a fair and balanced capitalism that promotes shared prosperity and works for both owners and employees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\", is \\"asked Riley to take charge but Riley was inexperienced\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"No, \\"asked Riley to take charge but Riley was inexperienced\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\". The given sentence only describes the situation and the reason behind Riley's poor performance, but it does not provide any information on the possible consequences or future outcomes for Riley. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question \\"What will happen to Riley?\\" could be: The outcome for Riley will depend on various factors, including how Aubrey and other team members react to the situation, the support and guidance that Riley receives, and Riley's own ability to learn and grow from this experience. 1. Aubrey's reaction: Aubrey's response to Riley's poor performance will play a significant role in determining what happens to Riley. If Aubrey is understanding and recognizes that Riley needs more guidance and support, they may offer to mentor Riley or pair them with a more experienced team member to help build their skills. Alternatively, Aubrey might decide to assign Riley a different role or responsibility more suited to their current skill level. 2. Team members' reaction: The reaction of other team members to Riley's performance can also influence Riley's future at the company. If the team is supportive and understanding, Riley may have an opportunity to learn from their mistake and improve their performance in the future. However, if the team is not supportive or does not trust Riley's ability to improve, it could lead to a negative work environment and potentially harm Riley's career growth. 3. Riley's willingness to learn and grow: Another crucial factor in determining what will happen to Riley is their personal attitude and willingness to learn from their mistakes. If Riley is proactive in seeking feedback, developing their skills, and adapting their work methods, they may overcome their inexperience and eventually excel in their role. On the other hand, if Riley is unwilling to accept responsibility for their mistakes and does not take steps to improve, they may continue to struggle and face negative consequences, such as being removed from their current position or having difficulty advancing in their career. 4. Support and resources provided to Riley: The resources and support Riley has access to will also significantly impact their ability to grow and succeed. If the company provides training opportunities, mentorship programs, or other resources that help Riley develop their skills, they will be more likely to overcome their inexperience and become a valuable asset to the team. If these resources are not provided or are limited, Riley may continue to face challenges in their role. Overall, the outcome for Riley will be dependent on multiple factors, and it is essential to consider these aspects when determining what will happen to them. A supportive environment, opportunities for growth, and a willingness to learn and adapt can help Riley overcome their inexperience and achieve success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
