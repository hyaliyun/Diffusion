You should classify the given sentence and choose the type of that sentence. Possible types are explained below. Policy: This refers to a sentence proposing a specific course of action to be taken. It typically contains modal verbs like \\"should\\" and \\"ought to\\". It cannot be directly proved with objective evidence, and a proper type of support is a logical reason from which the proposition can be inferred. Value: This refers to a sentence containing value judgments without making specific claims about what should be done (If so, then it is a Policy sentence.). Because of the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be proved directly with objective evidence. Fact: This refers to an objective proposition expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable.

Dr. Alex Hartman (protagonist), a newly-employed neuroscientist at Lacuna Corporation, begins to discover discrepancies in the company's claims of providing a perfectly safe memory erasure service. After conducting his own investigation, Alex learns about 'Echelon,' a mysterious project within the company that involves secretly collecting and storing erased memories from their clients in an underground facility, unbeknownst to them. While continuing his investigation into Echelon, Alex inadvertently discovers that he, too, is a victim of the company's experiments. Prior to joining Lacuna Corporation, he had discovered the truth about the company's motives which led to his memory being erased. He also learns about other victims, including his ex-girlfriend, Clara, whose existence was entirely removed from his memory. Additionally, Alex uncovers a conspiracy within the corporation involving its primary investor, Victor Vance, who plans to use the collected memories as a weapon for personal and political control. In an effort to expose the truth and bring justice to the victims, Alex teams up with an underground group of former Lacuna employees called the \\"Remembers,\\" who also have erased memories. Together, they devise a plan to infiltrate the Echelon facility, recover the valuable memory data, and reveal Victor Vance's secret plans to the public.

While Polish-Lithuanian army concentrated in Podolia, in deep south of the enormous Commonwealth, on August 19, 1621, a Swedish army landed near Pärnu , carried by a fleet of 148 vessels . Gustav Adolf had 14,700 infantry, 3,150 cavalry and 375 cannons. Swedes immediately marched towards Riga, and besieged it on 29 August. The capital of Livonia was defended by a garrison of 300 soldiers, plus 3,700 armed residents. Lithuanian Field Hetman Krzysztof Radziwiłł had only 1,500 soldiers at his disposal, as most units were in Podolia and Red Ruthenia. Riga capitulated on September 25, after a month siege and three assaults. On October 2, Swedes captured the fortress of Dunamunde. The invaders, marching through marshes and forests to avoid Lithuanian cavalry, entered the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, capturing its capital, Mitau without resistance. Swedes then tried to capture the fortress of Koknese, but failed to do so, after a skirmish with Lithuanian cavalry of Aleksander Gosiewski. In early January 1622, the Swedes captured Valmiera, together with several smaller Livonian castles. Meanwhile, the forces under Hetman Radziwill grew to 3 000, which enabled the Lithuanians to seal several Swedish garrisons. On January 7, Radziwiłł recaptured Mitau, but for lack of artillery, he failed to seize its castle, whose garrison did not capitulate until July 6. A few weeks later, in late July 1622, main Swedish forces reached Mittau, and a prolonged battle ensued. Since the battle turned into a stalemate, on August 10, 1622, both sides signed a truce, which in 1623 was prolonged until March 1625. During the negotiations, envoys of Gustav Adolf suggested a Swedish-Lithuanian union.

To calculate the number of days between these two events, we can follow these steps: 1. Find the difference in days between August 19 and August 29. Since both events occurred in the same month, we only need to subtract the day on which the Swedish army landed from the day they besieged Riga: 29 - 19 = 10 days.

Here's why: Laying down is the logical starting point for any activity related to staying in bed, as it involves positioning oneself comfortably on the bed in order to rest, relax, or sleep. Before planning to stay in bed, a person needs to ensure that they are comfortable, which requires them to lay down in a suitable position. Laying down signifies the initiation of the process of staying in bed and is often accompanied by adjusting pillows, blankets, and body posture. Now, let's discuss the other options briefly to understand why they are not suitable choices: 1. Bedsores: Bedsores, also known as pressure ulcers, are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. They typically occur in individuals who are bedridden or have limited mobility. Bedsores are not a preparatory action for staying in bed but rather an unfortunate outcome that may result from staying in bed too long without proper care. 2. Bed sores: This option is the same as bedsores and therefore can be disregarded for the same reasons mentioned above. 3. Sleep in: While \\"sleeping in\\" is often associated with staying in bed for an extended period, it is not the very first thing that someone does before planning to stay in bed. Rather, sleeping in is an activity that follows after laying down. It is the act of staying in bed for a longer duration than usual, often to catch up on rest or to have a leisurely morning. However, it is not the immediate step before staying in bed. 4. Open the curtain: Opening the curtain might be an action associated with waking up and starting the day or letting in natural light to improve the ambiance in the room. While it is an activity that could improve the overall experience of staying in bed, it is not the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed. Moreover, opening the curtain is not necessary for individuals who prefer to sleep or relax in a dim or dark room. In conclusion, among the given options, \\"lay down\\" is the most suitable choice as the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed. It marks the initial step of adjusting oneself comfortably on the bed, which is essential for activities like resting, relaxing, or sleeping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to store honey for it to last the longest?","completion":"To store honey for the longest possible shelf life, follow these steps: 1. Choose the right container: Select a non-reactive, airtight container made from materials like glass or food-grade plastic. This will prevent any contamination or spoilage. Glass jars with airtight lids, such as mason jars or specialized honey jars, are ideal. 2. Store in a cool, dark place: Find a location away from direct sunlight, heat, and humidity, as these factors can degrade honey over time. A pantry or cupboard is a suitable choice. The ideal storage temperature for honey is between 50-70°F (10-21°C), as fluctuations in temperature can cause crystallization. 3. Ensure cleanliness: Prior to transferring the honey to the container, make sure both the container and any tools you use are clean and dry. This will help prevent the introduction of bacteria or moisture. 4. Seal the container tightly: After you fill the container with honey, make sure the lid is sealed tightly. This helps maintain freshness and prevent moisture or contaminants from entering. 5. Label the container: Write the date and type of honey on a label and attach it to the jar. This way, you can keep track of how long the honey has been in storage and what variety it is. 6. Avoid contamination: Each time you access the honey, use clean utensils and do not introduce any foreign substances, like crumbs or liquid. 7. Monitor the honey: Regularly check the honey for any signs of spoilage, such as off-odors, mold, or fermentation. In most cases, honey can last indefinitely if stored properly, so as long as it's not showing any signs of spoilage, it should be safe to consume. By following these steps, you can ensure that your honey is stored in the best way to last the longest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (lead vocals/drums), Todd Harrell (bass), and Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals). They were soon joined by rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson. The band rose to international fame with their first single, \\"Kryptonite\\", which charted in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. 3 Doors Down's first studio album, The Better Life, was released on February 8, 2000 and went on to become the 11th best-selling album of the year, selling over three million copies. It has since been certified 6x platinum, thanks in large part to the international hit singles, \\"Kryptonite\\", \\"Loser\\", and \\"Duck and Run\\". A fourth single, \\"Be Like That\\" was re-recorded for the 2001 film American Pie 2, with alternate lyrics for the first 3 lines. This version is known as \\"The American Pie 2 Edit\\". Whilst recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum parts. However, the band hired drummer Richard Liles for the tour in support of The Better Life so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage. Liles left in late 2001. The band's second studio album, Away from the Sun, was released on November 12, 2002 and went platinum within two months of release. The album also produced two hit singles, \\"When I'm Gone\\" and \\"Here Without You\\". The album has sold four million copies worldwide, including well over three million in the U.S. Session drummer Josh Freese was hired to record drums for the album. Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson produced and performed on three tracks for the record, \\"Dangerous Game\\", \\"Dead Love\\", and \\"Wasted Me\\", but only \\"Dangerous Game\\" would appear on the finished product. The band hired Canadian Daniel Adair to play drums for the Away From the Sun tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band's next studio release, and was with the band aboard the USS George Washington (CVN-73) to film the music video \\"When I'm Gone\\". In 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live EP entitled Another 700 Miles consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois. Another 700 Miles has since been certified Gold in the United States. In addition to featuring some of 3 Doors Down's hit singles from their previous two albums, the EP also contains a version of the popular 1977 Lynyrd Skynyrd song \\"That Smell\\". The group toured with Nickelback in 2004. In 2003, the band began hosting the annual \\"3 Doors Down and Friends\\" benefit concert, through the band's own charity The Better Life Foundation. In 2006, this event was held at the Mobile Convention Center, with proceeds benefiting Hurricane Katrina survivors.

Please answer the following question: What are the names of the three habitats that are designated as a red-zone area? Answer the above question based on the context below: The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes.

Question: Background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Paragraph: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.

However, it is important to note that this could depend on the specifics of the illness, the individual's general health, and other factors.

Option B, training, is not in line with common sense as a sick person should primarily focus on rest and recovery rather than engaging in physical activities that might further stress their body.

Here are the specified instructions: 1. Separate the list into two parts: one for alphabetical elements and the other for numerical elements, maintaining their original order. 2. Merge the two lists; the one with alphabetical items first followed by the one with numerical items. Let's follow these instructions to solve the example: First, we create two empty lists: one for storing the alphabetical elements and another for storing the numerical elements. \`\`\`python alpha_elems = [] num_elems = [] \`\`\` Next, we loop through each item in the given list. If the item is an alphabetic character, we add it to \`alpha_elems\`. If it's a number, we add it to \`num_elems\`. \`\`\`python input_list = ['w', 'f', '5567', 'U', 'e', 'V', '5481', '441', 'N', '6997', 'y', '3337', 'Y', '6129', '3219', '3545', 'Z', '5667', '5129', 'K', '489', '2179', '8935', '909', '5339', '4811', 'b', '7595', 'p', 'z', '5961', 'W', 'd'] for item in input_list: if item.isalpha(): # checks if item is alphabetical alpha_elems.append(item) elif item.isdigit(): # checks if item is numerical num_elems.append(item) \`\`\` Finally, we combine the two lists such that \`alpha_elems\` comes first followed by \`num_elems\`. \`\`\`python combined_list = alpha_elems + num_elems # concatenate the two lists \`\`\` The \`combined_list\` should now be a rearranged version of the original list where all alphabetical elements come first, in their original order, followed by all numerical elements, also in their original order. Let's see the result: \`\`\`python print(combined_list) \`\`\` Upon running the code, the expected output should be: ['w', 'f', 'U', 'e', 'V', 'N', 'y', 'Y', 'Z', 'K', 'b', 'p', 'z', 'W', 'd', '5567', '5481', '441', '6997', '3337', '6129', '3219', '3545', '5667', '5129', '489', '2179', '8935', '909', '5339', '4811', '7595', '5961']"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways - Question: suppose the bat is unaware of its surroundings happens, how will it affect STRONGER echolocation. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"Echolocation is a biological sonar system used by certain animals, including bats, to navigate and find food in the dark by producing sounds that bounce off objects and return as echoes. If a bat is unaware of its surroundings, it may use echolocation more vigorously, resulting in a STRONGER echolocation effect. When the bat produces a high-pitched tone, this sound travels in waves the same way light does. These sound waves radiate out from the bat and interact with the environment around it. When they strike an object in the bat's path, they are reflected back towards the bat. This bounced sound is the echo, which is perceived by the bat and processed in its brain to gain awareness about its environment. If the bat is unaware of its surroundings, which could be due to various factors such as a novel environment, distraction, or temporarily impaired senses, it may need to produce higher frequency and louder sounds to compensate for the lack of knowledge and ensure it doesn’t collide with obstacles or miss potential prey. This would result in a more intense or stronger echolocation. The second effect mentioned is the reflection or the \\"bouncing off\\" of sound waves from a nearby object. In a scenario where the bat is unaware of its surroundings, this reflection of sound waves would be more crucial for the bat to successfully navigate and hunt. It would need higher resolution information on obstacles and prey in the environment, and thus the bounced sound waves would need to be more accurately caught and interpreted. This is dependent on the strength of the returned sound waves, which is determined by the intensity of the initially emitted sound. Thus, if the bat produces stronger echolocation sounds, the returned sound waves would be stronger, leading to a stronger echo effect. In summary, if the bat is unaware of its surroundings, it would have a more pronounced or stronger echolocation as it would need to compensate for the lack of knowledge by emitting a higher frequency and or louder sounds for better and more accurate interpretation of the surroundings. Hence, this supposed perturbation will have a 'more' effect. Then, the effect of the echo or bounced sound waves would also be increased. Since the bat would rely more heavily on the reflection of the sound waves, it would capture and interpret these returned sound waves more intensively than usual, leading to an increased second effect of echolocation. Hence, the perturbation would also result in a 'more' effect on the second effect mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Vulture spots the bizarre story in a longer New York Times article about Harvey Weinstein and the Sunday premiere of the Weinstein Company's film about the Hurricane Sandy relief concert. It seems the prince offered to make a generous contribution to the relief fund if Stewart would chat with him, and Weinstein eventually convinced her to do so. \\"How much?\\" Stewart asked, in Weinstein's telling of the story. Weinstein went back to the prince, got a number, and then talked him up to half a mil—which the prince gave him upfront, in cash. \\"And Kristen sits with the guy for 15 minutes,\\" Weinstein says. But things may not be going so well for Stewart: She has a strange bald spot, and the Daily Mail concludes it's because she's so stressed about her breakup with Robert Pattinson. The Stir thinks there's probably a more reasonable explanation, like a nutrient deficiency or even just a bad photo angle. Article:","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a famous actress named Kristen Stewart. She was very popular, and many people liked her a lot. One day, a prince from a faraway land in the Middle East heard about Kristen and thought it would be wonderful to talk to her. But, he had a special wish – he would give 500,000 to a group of people who were trying to help others after a big storm called Hurricane Sandy if he could talk to Kristen for just 15 minutes. A man named Harvey Weinstein, who made movies, heard about the prince's wish. He went to Kristen and told her about the prince's generous offer. Kristen asked, \\"How much money will the prince give?\\" Harvey talked to the prince and said that the prince had to give half a million dollars for the chance to talk to Kristen. The prince agreed and gave Harvey the money in cash right away. So, Kristen sat down and spoke with the prince for 15 minutes, just like he wanted. Harvey said, \\"And Kristen sits with the guy for 15 minutes.\\" And one might wonder, was Kristen sad during this time? You see, Kristen was having a tough time because she and her boyfriend, Robert Pattinson, broke up. People even thought Kristen had a bald spot on her head because she was so stressed about the breakup. But some people thought there might be a different reason for Kristen's bald spot, like maybe she didn't have enough nutrients in her body or maybe the picture that was taken of her was just from a bad angle. No matter what, Kristen showed that she could be friendly and have a conversation with someone, like the prince, even when things weren't so easy for her.

Question: Information: - The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China, and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China (CPC). The war began in August 1927, with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major hostilities ceased in 1950. It can generally be divided into two stages; the first being from 1927 to 1937, and the second being from 1946 to 1950 with the Second Sino-Japanese War separating them. The war was a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the CPC gaining control of almost the entirety of Mainland China, establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) to replace the KMT's Republic of China (ROC). It also caused a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all of China. - University College London (UCL) is a public research university in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. It is the largest postgraduate institution in the UK by enrollment and is regarded as one of the world's leading multidisciplinary research universities. Established in 1826 as London University by founders inspired by the radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university institution to be established in London, and the first in England to be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their religion. UCL also makes the contested claims of being the third-oldest university in England and the first to admit women. In 1836 UCL became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London, which was granted a royal charter in the same year. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014). UCL has its main campus in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London and a satellite campus in Doha, Qatar. UCL is organised into 11 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL operates several culturally significant museums and manages collections in a wide range of fields, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and administers the annual Orwell Prize in political writing. In 2015/16, UCL had around 38,300 students and 12,000 staff (including around 7,100 academic staff and 840 professors) and had a total income of £1.36 billion, of which £530 million was from research grants and contracts.

He complains to his doctor, Ann Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) that if she leaves him alone, then She (Kayako) will get him. Sullivan tells him that he is there for his own protection, and that he will be safe there. She apologises to him and leaves, telling him she will be back later. Jake bangs on the door, but Kayako (Aiko Horiuchi) appears behind him, and breaks his bones, killing him. Sullivan arrives back to find Jake lying dead on the floor and begins to think he was right all along.Kayako's sister, Naoko (Emi Ikehata), is a young Japanese woman who hears of Jake's death through the newspaper and becomes worried. Naoko knows how to stop the grudge and travels to America, more specifically to Chicago where the last incident linked with Kayako occurred. She is introduced to the Chicago apartment by Max, (Gil McKinney) the landlord, and immediately begins to feel her sister's presence. She meets Max's little sister, Rose, and she somehow knows that Rose is in touch with the dead and can communicate with Toshio, Naoko's nephew. She also meets Lisa (Johanna Braddy) and they quickly become friends, and they meet other residents of the apartment, including Gretchen, (Marina Sirtis) who is an artist. Lisa begins to grow frightened when she realizes her younger sister Rose is seeing a dead boy all around the apartment.Naoko is observed throughout the apartment by Kayako, her sister, but Kayako never actually kills Naoko, quite possibly because she still loves her sister. Later that day, Lisa encounters Toshio, who makes her jump. When asking him what he is doing in the apartment, Toshio vanishes leaving Lisa bewildered. A girl is killed when Kayako's hands pull her into her bathtub and drown her. At night, Gretchen is painting a beautiful picture of Rose and when she turns away she finds it almost shredded and in a pool of red paint that resembles blood.

A:","completion":"Takeo Saeki is a character from the Ju-on series, a Japanese horror franchise created by Takashi Shimizu. The films revolve around a curse created by the violent death of a person, which is passed on to anyone who enters the haunted location where the incident occurred. Takeo Saeki plays a significant role in the creation of the curse. In the story, Takeo Saeki, a jealous husband, murders his wife, Kayako, and their son, Toshio, in a fit of rage after discovering Kayako's unrequited love for another man. This violent act sets off the curse and leads to the formation of the vengeful spirits of Kayako and Toshio, who haunt the Saeki family home and kill anyone who enters the house. As for \\"The Grudge 3\\", it is the third installment of the American version of the Ju-on series, following the story of Jake Kimble, a survivor from the previous film, who is now institutionalized due to his traumatic experiences. The film introduces Kayako's sister, Naoko, who tries to stop the curse from spreading by traveling to America and performing a ritual to appease the spirits. As you are trying to decide whether or not to invest in this film proposal, there are several factors you might want to consider. First, it is important to evaluate the potential market and reception of the film. Since \\"The Grudge\\" franchise has a dedicated fan base and the American adaptations have garnered substantial box office success, there's a possibility that \\"The Grudge 3\\" could continue this trend. Second, consider the creative team and talent involved in the project. Assess the director, screenwriter, and cast members to determine if they hold potential to bring forth a successful adaptation, consistent with the legacy of the previous films. Third, evaluate the production budget. While horror movies tend to have lower budgets compared to other genres, it's crucial to ensure that the funds allocated are sufficient to achieve high production values, especially in terms of visual and practical effects, for the supernatural and horror elements to be truly captivating. Moreover, consider the current market trends in the entertainment industry. Over recent years, successful horror films have evolved, incorporating social themes, commentary, and psychological elements. Assess if \\"The Grudge 3\\" could cater to these changing preferences while maintaining loyal fans from previous installments. In conclusion, Takeo Saeki, a pivotal character in the Ju-on series, is directly responsible for the curse that emanates from the violent murder of his wife, Kayako, and son, Toshio. When deciding whether to invest in \\"The Grudge 3\\", consider factors such as the potential market and reception, the creative team and talent involved, the overall production budget, and current trends in the horror genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. and the situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. Answer the following question: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The red chair, which Patrick sits on, has a lower air pressure. Here's an explanation: Both chairs are identical except for their color, so we can assume they have the same initial volume, temperature, and pressure. When Mark, who weighs more than Patrick, sits on the green chair, he exerts more force on it, compressing the air inside the chair to a greater extent than Patrick compresses the air in the red chair. According to Boyle's law, when the volume of a gas decreases (due to compression from the heavier weight), the pressure inside the gas increases, given that the temperature remains constant. As Mark compresses the green chair more than Patrick compresses the red chair, the air pressure inside the green chair will be higher compared to the air pressure in the red chair. Hence, the red chair has a lower air pressure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

(Click here to read about the civilian toll of US drones in Pakistan)","completion":"Title: Iran Unveils its First Domestically Built Unmanned Bomber Drone, Karrar Introduction: Following yesterday's developments in nuclear reactors, Iran has revealed its first domestically manufactured unmanned bomber drone. This 13-foot-long aircraft, given the name Karrar or striker, is set to carry up to four cruise missiles and is said to have a range of 620 miles. Although this isn't far enough to reach Israel, it shows Iran's progress in military technology. Unmanned drones are becoming increasingly significant in modern conflicts, and Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, emphasizes that the Karrar is a step towards self-sufficiency. Iran's President's Message: During the unveiling, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed that the Karrar drone was an \\"ambassador of death for the enemies of humanity,\\" but also a message of \\"peace and friendship.\\" He further boasted that the missile would help keep the enemy \\"paralyzed in its bases\\" and that it was an essential part of Iran's efforts in achieving self-sufficiency. While the drone isn't capable of reaching Israel, the development surely put Iran's other adversaries on alert. Increasing Importance of Unmanned Drones in Modern Conflicts: The deployment of unmanned drones has risen steadily in modern warfare, especially among the US military. They are primarily focussed on minimizing the casualties of American soldiers, as well as providing intelligence and surveillance. Drones are valuable assets to possess in conflict situations, and Iran's progress in this field will undoubtedly draw attention from military powers around the world. Though there are concerns about their impact on civilian populations, drones have proven to be an essential tool for modern military endeavors. Reports of the civilian toll of US drones in Pakistan have sparked debates on the ethics of drone usage in conflicts; however, it is undeniable that drones have changed the way wars are fought. Conclusion: Iran's unveiling of its first domestically built unmanned bomber drone, the 13-foot-long Karrar, showcases the country's advancements in military technology. As a part of Iran's aim to achieve self-sufficiency, the drone reflects the nation's commitment to staying competitive in the ever-changing landscape of modern warfare. With unmanned drones becoming increasingly important in conflict situations, Iran's development of the Karrar is a significant milestone for the country, even if it cannot reach Israel's borders. The rise of unmanned drones continues to alter the dynamics of warfare, and Iran's entry into this field is sure to send ripples throughout the international community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals and pour thick flour over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Which of the following statements best describes the role of a Foley artist in the film industry?

The offering is expected to go live later this month in invitation-only beta. The options for the service include unlimited streaming and four DVDs a month from Redbox's kiosks for 8 a month, and 9 for the same deal with Blu-ray discs. Though Redbox didn't mention it in a press release announcing the plan, AllThingsD reports that there will also be a 6 option for unlimited streaming only — less than the 7.99 Netflix currently charges. You can also buy and rent videos online from Redbox. Reps from Redbox could not be reached for comment. Redbox's content is drawn from Epix, whose selections include Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Hugo and Captain America among its new titles and classics like Apocalypse Now and Footloose. Other content will come from Warner Bros.' older selections. Verizon and Redbox, a unit of Coinstar, joined forces in February. Redbox isn't the first to take on Netflix in streaming. Amazon offers streaming as part of its 79 Amazon Prime membership. However, Amazon scrapped a plan to challenge Netflix more directly with a 7.99 monthly option. ||||| The Redbox Verizon Movie Service Is Almost Ready to Take On Netflix Here comes the next video service that wants to take on Netflix: Redbox and Verizon are finally ready to launch their long-awaited joint venture. Well, almost ready: “Redbox Instant by Verizon” will go into an invitation-only beta launch this month, and the official push won’t start until next year. Still, this means the company is officially unveiling its offering. Which is exactly what we told you it would be: A service that’s supposed to offer some streaming video, a la Netflix, and some movies via DVD, a la the old Netflix and the curent RedBox. And the ability to buy and rent individual movies online, like iTunes and Amazon. The basic offer: 8 a month for a selection of streaming movies and the ability to rent up to 4 DVDs a month from Redboxes’ kiosks, plus an online store where you can buy or rent newer movies. If you don’t want to or can’t use the Redbox kiosks, you can go for a streaming-only option for 6. If you want to rent Blu-ray discs, that’s 9 a month. Like Netflix and Amazon, Redbox has a deal with Epix, which means you’ll get newish movies like “Thor,” along with some big titles like “The Hunger Games,” after they’ve been available for rental and on pay TV. It also has a similar deal for older movies from Warner Bros., which hasn’t cut deals with Netflix or Amazon (yet). But the joint venture won’t have the deeper catalog titles its competitors have built up. And it has pretty much ignored the TV titles that Netflix in particular has concentrated on in recent years. On the other hand, it will have an online store where you can rent and buy movies, which Netflix doesn’t offer — because, says CEO Reed Hastings, everyone else does. Though this store will be different from those run by other online retailers like Amazon and iTunes: For whatever reason, the company hasn’t signed on all of the studios, so there will be notable gaps from the likes of Disney and Sony. (Update: Redbox Instant says it does have a deal with Sony, after all.) So basically: Costs about the same as Netflix, without some of the stuff people like about Netflix, with other stuff Netflix doesn’t have. Is that compelling enough to take market share away from Hastings? We’ll have to wait some time to see, but it’s worth noting that Amazon and Hulu, which have been at this for a while, have yet to make a real dent. In the meantime, the most interesting thing about Redbox Instant is what it could be, one day, if Verzion wants to push it. The service isn’t confined to Verizon’s fiber or wireless footprint, which means it could truly make it a national video service, if it wants to commit the resources. So far this looks more like a toe in the water than anything else. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Redbox Instant by Verizon is set to challenge Netflix in the streaming video market with a new service starting at just 6 a month. The offering will begin an invitation-only beta launch this month and is expected to provide unlimited streaming and four DVD rentals per month from Redbox's kiosks for 8 a month or 9 with Blu-ray discs. The content will be sourced from Epix and include films like Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Hugo, and Captain America, as well as selections from Warner Bros.' older collection. This joint venture between Verizon and Redbox's parent company, Coinstar, aims to potentially take market share from Netflix; however, it is still unclear how much of an impact this new offering will have on the existing competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To correct their error, they wiped it down with something else to take it off and we were told it be gone when it dried. They LIED! It did not come off and my interior is ruined with that shiny crap! These people do not READ tickets and they LIE!","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is strongly negative. The reviewer expresses a high level of dissatisfaction and frustration with the service received. Several elements contribute to the negative sentiment: 1. The use of intense negative words and phrases: Words such as \\"HORRIBLE\\", \\"did not bother\\", \\"Really?!!\\", \\"They LIED!\\", \\"ruined\\", and \\"shiny crap\\" all underline the author's strong negative feelings. 2. Expressions of disappointment: The reviewer displayed disappointment in multiple aspects of the service. First, the service provider did not follow the instructions specified (\\"They were told NO vinyl protectant on the interior\\"). Second, the effort to correct the mistake with a promise that the substance would be gone when dried proved to be false (\\"they wiped it down with something else to take it off and we were told it be gone when it dried. They LIED!\\"). 3. Accusations of misconduct: The accusations add to the strong negative sentiment. The reviewer accuses the service provider of not reading the ticket correctly (\\"person wiping the car down did not bother to read the ticket\\") and dishonesty (\\"They LIED!\\"). 4. Consequences of the service: Use of words like \\"my interior is ruined\\" indicates the serious impact of the service on the product (car's interior). 5. Overall evaluation: The review closes with a negative summary judgment, reinforcing the negative sentiment of the message (\\"These people do not READ tickets and they LIE!\\"). In a nutshell, this review strongly conveys disappointment, frustration, and dissatisfaction coming from a negative experience the customer had with the service provider."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer expresses enthusiasm and satisfaction about various aspects of the dining experience, including the quality of the dishes they ordered (short rib, pork belly and clams, bone marrow, and crème brûlée), the great service, and the overall enjoyable experience. The reviewer's positive sentiment is evident through the use of enthusiastic language like \\"loved,\\" \\"yummy,\\" \\"great,\\" and \\"awesome.\\" Additionally, the fact that they chose to return to the establishment the next day for another dining experience, even after the initial disappointment, further underscores their overall satisfaction and positive feelings towards the place. The word \\"glad\\" also emphasizes that their return visit reaffirmed their initial positive impressions of the establishment and justified their decision to go back. The sentiment dips slightly into the negative when the reviewer mentions their disappointment about the kitchen closing early one night at around 9:30-10 pm. This event prevented them from having the desired dining experience at their hotel. However, it is important to note that the mention of disappointment is brief and confined to this particular challenge with the scheduling. The review ultimately concludes on a highly positive note by reiterating how good the food was on their return visit, suggesting that the minor disappointment did not substantially dampen their overall satisfaction with the establishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.","completion":"In the West, Buddhism is not seen as traditional but rather is often perceived as exotic and progressive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why did India banned 500, 1000 rupee notes? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"I will focus on the two main questions: 1. Why did Modi ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes? 2. Do the two questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Understand and clarify the queries. Both questions are related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India. Step 2: Research and gather information. In November 2016, the Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announced the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. Step 3: Identify the reasons for demonetization. The primary reasons for demonetization were: a. Combatting corruption: High denomination notes were often used to store and move unaccounted-for cash, which facilitated corruption and the generation of \\"black money.\\" b. Tackling tax evasion: Many people stored their wealth in cash to avoid paying taxes. By banning high-denomination notes, the government aimed to reduce tax evasion. c. Curb counterfeit currency: Fake currency notes posed a risk to the economy and were sometimes used for illicit activities, such as funding terrorism. The demonetization helped curb the circulation of counterfeit currency by replacing old notes with new designs featuring enhanced security features. d. Encouraging digital transactions: Removing high-value cash from the economy helped promote the use of digital transactions, which are more transparent and traceable. Step 4: Establish the relationship between the two questions. Both questions are related to the same topic – the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India in 2016, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The first question asks why Modi made the decision, while the second question asks about India as a whole. Step 5: Answer the questions. 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India to combat corruption, reduce tax evasion, curb counterfeit currency, and encourage digital transactions. 2. Although the two questions have a slightly different focus (Modi's role in the first and India as a whole in the second), they essentially have the same meaning, as they both seek to understand the reasons for the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula.

How to know and exercise your rights as a person with a disability Order copies of free americans with disabilities act (ada) materials. You can get these from the u.s. department of justice. You can also call the ada's 24-hour, toll-free number to listen to recorded information or to order information pertaining to disability rights over the phone.","completion":"Knowing and exercising your rights as a person with a disability is crucial to ensuring that you are treated fairly and have access to the proper accommodations and resources you need to lead an independent life. Becoming informed about your rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and knowing how to access and utilize the available resources is paramount. First, it's essential to understand what the ADA is. The ADA is a civil rights law that was enacted in 1990 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in areas including employment, public accommodations, transportation, telecommunications, and state and local government services. This law covers a wide range of disabilities, from mobility and sensory impairments to cognitive and learning disabilities. To know and exercise your rights, follow these steps: 1. Order copies of free ADA materials: Visit the U.S. Department of Justice's ADA website (www.ada.gov) to find various materials, including booklets, guides, and fact sheets, all designed to educate people with disabilities about their rights and responsibilities. Download and study these materials to understand the full range of your rights under the ADA. 2. Call the ADA hotline: You can also call the ADA's 24-hour, toll-free number at 1-800-514-0301 (for voice calls) or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY for people with hearing impairments) to listen to recorded information or order printed information over the phone. The ADA Information Line is staffed with specialists who can answer specific questions and provide general information about the ADA. 3. Visit ADA National Network: The ADA National Network (adata.org) provides various resources, tools, and training materials to help individuals and organizations understand and comply with the ADA. Browse through their website and take advantage of the free resources available on different topics, including housing, employment, education, and accessibility. 4. Reach out to local disability organizations: Many local disability advocacy groups, independent living centers, vocational rehabilitation agencies, and other non-profit organizations offer a range of services tailored to individuals with disabilities. These services can include assistance with accessing resources, connecting with support networks, and identifying appropriate accommodations. 5. Know your rights in specific sectors: Understand your rights in various settings, such as employment, education, and healthcare. For instance, under Title I of the ADA, employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees or job applicants with disabilities. Learn about the processes of requesting accommodations and filing complaints if you face discrimination. 6. Be proactive about accessibility concerns: If you encounter an inaccessible location, service, or communication, document the situation and bring your concerns to the attention of the responsible party (e.g., the business owner, service provider, or government agency). Speak with them about the ADA requirements and potential solutions for increasing accessibility in their establishment. 7. File complaints if necessary: If you believe your rights under the ADA have been violated, you can file a complaint with the appropriate government agency responsible for enforcing the law. The U.S. Department of Justice maintains jurisdiction over Title II (state and local governments) and Title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) of the ADA. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title I of the ADA (employment) regarding private and state or local government employers. By taking these steps, you can ensure that you are informed about your rights as a person with a disability and can advocate for yourself in various situations. Being proactive about understanding the ADA and accessing the available resources will empower you to live a full and independent life without limitations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today is May Day!\\" my sister announced. \\"Do you remember the May Day baskets we used to make with colored paper and paste?\\" I recalled that my sisters and I would run around our neighborhood delivering the baskets brimming with spring flowers. We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them. I clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade. Her interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house. When my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, \\"Absolutely not!\\" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. \\"But Pam was my very best friend ever,\\" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket. It was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness. As we watched from our hiding place, Pam picked up the flowers, and said loudly enough for us to hear, \\"Thank you, Susie, I hoped you wouldn't forget me!\\". Question: In the opinion of Susie's mom, friends _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"leave each other enough room to grow\\"?

She supports this point by convincing Susie to make a May Day basket for Pam, showing that regardless of the changes in their friendship, they should respect each other's room to grow and develop."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Given the background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution.

Step 2: Understand the question - Which would a strawberry most rely on to ensure it gets planted? Step 3: Relate the fact to the question - Birds can potentially disperse seeds of a plant such as a strawberry. Step 4: Research on strawberry seed dispersal - Strawberries primarily rely on animals, like birds or mammals, to consume their fruit and later disperse seeds through their droppings. Another method of seed dispersal for strawberries is their external seeds (achenes) sticking to fur or feathers, thus being carried away and eventually deposited in a new area.

He meets Kirina in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship.

The band consists of Brody Dalle (the Distillers), Tony Bevilacqua (the Distillers), Jack Irons (What Is This?, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Walk the Moon, Eleven, Pearl Jam) and Alain Johannes (What Is This?, Walk the Moon, Eleven, Queens of the Stone Age, Them Crooked Vultures). The band has been inactive since 2010 and its future is uncertain. Hypothesis: Spinnerette might come back","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is difficult to definitively confirm or disprove the hypothesis that Spinnerette might come back. The paragraph states that Spinnerette has been inactive since 2010, and the future of the band remains uncertain. However, it is worth considering a few factors that could influence the likelihood of a reunion: 1. Members' involvement in other projects: It is clear that the members of Spinnerette have been part of multiple bands and projects in their respective careers. For instance, Jack Irons has been a member of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and several other bands, while Alain Johannes has been associated with Queens of the Stone Age and Them Crooked Vultures. The fact that they have diverse musical interests and professional commitments may reduce the likelihood of the band reuniting in the foreseeable future. 2. Time since inactivity: Spinnerette has been inactive for over a decade, which could diminish the prospect of a reunion. As time passes, the members may become more invested in their individual projects, and the level of nostalgia associated with the band may decrease for both the members and their audience. 3. Personal relationships between band members: The paragraph does not provide any information on the personal dynamics between the members of Spinnerette. The relationships between band members can have a significant impact on the possibility of a reunion. For example, if the members parted on amicable terms and maintain positive relationships, the chances of a reunion could be higher. Conversely, if conflicts arose between the members, the likelihood of a comeback may be diminished. 4. Demand from fans and the music industry: The desire of fans for a Spinnerette reunion may play a role in determining the likelihood of a comeback. If there is a significant demand for new music or performances from the band, this could encourage the members to consider reuniting. Similarly, interest from record labels or other industry stakeholders could serve as a motive for a reunion. In conclusion, while the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm or disprove the hypothesis, there are several factors to consider when evaluating the likelihood of Spinnerette reuniting in the future. These factors include the members' involvement in other projects, the time since the band's inactivity, personal relationships between band members, and demand from fans and the music industry. Each of these factors could influence the probability of a reunion, either positively or negatively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The word \\"ionize\\" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.The word radiation arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point. A scientists has discovered two new types of radiation. He notes that radiation type A has the ability to break away atoms from molecules, while radiation type B simply causes them to vibrate. Which radiation type will have a longer wavelength, radiation type A or B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Radiation type B will have a longer wavelength. Step 1: Identify the properties of the two types of radiation. - Radiation type A: Breaks away atoms from molecules (higher energy) - Radiation type B: Causes atoms to vibrate (lower energy) Step 2: Recognize the relationship between energy and wavelength. In the electromagnetic spectrum, higher energy radiation has shorter wavelengths, while lower energy radiation has longer wavelengths. Step 3: Compare the energies of the two types of radiation. Since radiation type A breaks away atoms from molecules, it has higher energy than radiation type B, which only causes vibrations. Step 4: Determine which radiation type has a longer wavelength based on their energies. As radiation type B has lower energy than radiation type A, its wavelength will be longer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Choose stilettos in your size and put them on. Try to raise your heels up 1 inch (2.5 cm). You should be able to do this comfortably if the shoes fit properly. Your toes shouldn't feel pinched and there should be no gap between the arch of the shoe and your feet. If you're buying stilettos, place them on a flat surface and tap the sides. The shoes shouldn't wobble or fall over. Consider purchasing stilettos made of a material, such as leather, that will stretch slightly. Before you break in a new pair of stilettos or while you're getting used to walking in your pair, place toe gels, moleskin insoles, arch supports, heel pads, or blister strips into the shoes. These will cushion your feet and prevent rubbing that could cause painful calluses. If you're not sure where to put insoles or supports, wear the stilettos for about 5 minutes and pay attention to wear the shoes are hurting your feet. Use duct or medical tape to wrap your third and fourth toes together. This will reduce the amount of pressure on the nerve between these two toes. Remove the tape when you take your stilettos off and stretch your toes. It's easy to think that once you get used to wearing high heels, you can purchase a new pair of stilettos and wear them right out. Since each pair of shoes is different, your feet need a chance to adjust to the material, fit, and feel of the shoes. Wear them around the house until they feel comfortable. Then you can wear them out. It's fine to wear stilettos on carpet or rugs in your house. The point is to get your feet used to how the shoes feel. If you're planning on wearing stilettos to the office or a social event, have a comfortable pair of shoes ready to change into if your feet start hurting. You can also take breaks and change back into your stilettos throughout the day. For example, commute in comfortable flats and change into stilettos when you arrive at the event or office. Rest your feet after wearing stilettos. Fill a small basin or bath with water and dissolve some Epsom salt in it. Then soak your feet for up to 20 minutes. Once you get your feet out of the water, dry them and massage moisturizer into your feet. To massage your feet, use your thumbs to rub the balls of your feet using a circular motion. Then massage towards the heels of your feet. Do this as much as you like. Summary:","completion":"Choosing the right size and fit of stilettos is crucial for comfort. The shoes should allow you to lift your heels by an inch without pinching at the toes or creating a gap under the arch. Make sure they are stable when tapped on the sides. Consider materials like leather that slightly stretch for better fit and comfort. To prevent calluses, consider using foot cushions like toe gels, moleskin insoles, arch supports, and others. To minimize pressure, you can tape your third and fourth toes together. Each new pair of stilettos requires an adjustment period, so wear them around the house first before going out.

Movie title: The China Syndrome Context: While visiting the (fictional) Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells (Fonda), her cameraman Richard Adams (Douglas) and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief. Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least 20 million. Godell confronts D.B.

Humans have just discovered the ability to asexually reproduce if they wish. Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis. Jimmy was born by sexual reproduction and one of his parents has the same genetic disease as Billy's parents. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis? Hint: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. A:","completion":"Jimmy is less likely to have Horkrumatis. Step 1: Analyze the information provided. - Billy is born through asexual reproduction, meaning he has an exact copy of his parent's DNA. - Jimmy is born through sexual reproduction, meaning he has a combination of DNA from both parents. Step 2: Consider the genetic disease Horkrumatis. - Both Billy's parent and one of Jimmy's parents have the disease. Step 3: Analyze the potential inheritance of the disease for each child. - Billy, being an exact copy of his parent, will have the gene that causes Horkrumatis. - Jimmy has a 50% chance of inheriting the Horkrumatis gene from the affected parent, as he receives a mix of genes. Step 4: Compare likelihoods - Since Billy will definitely have the Horkrumatis gene and Jimmy only has a 50% chance of inheriting it, Jimmy is less likely to have Horkrumatis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The three go missing, but a year later their footage is found in a bag inexplicably buried under an abandoned 100-year-old house.According to legend, the Blair Witch is the ghost of Elly Kedward of the late 1700s, whom several children accused of luring them into her home to draw blood from them. Kedward is found guilty of witchcraft, banished from the village during a particularly harsh winter, and presumed dead. By midwinter, all of Kedward's accusers, along with half of the town's children, vanish. Fearing a curse, the townspeople flee Blair and vow never to utter Elly Kedward's name again.In 1825, 11 witnesses testify to seeing a pale woman's hand reach up and pull ten-year-old Eileen Treacle into Tappy East Creek. Her body is never recovered, and for thirteen days after the drowning the creek is clogged with oily bundles of sticks.

None of the above choices .. II. that he is responsible. III. that he is lying. IV. that he is truthful. Q: what does the narrator think about the caller ?","completion":"Based on the given choices, it is most likely that the narrator is unsure or skeptical about the caller's statement. The narrator's response \\"Are you serious?\\" could indicate a suspicion that the caller might be exaggerating their condition or not being entirely truthful. However, without any explicit mention of their thoughts, it is difficult to definitively state what the narrator thinks of the caller. To provide a more thorough analysis, let us examine the context surrounding the caller's statement and the narrator's response: 1. The caller claims to be \\"so weak and tired\\" to the point where they can \\"barely see.\\" - If this is true, it would stand that the caller is experiencing severe fatigue or weakness and would be unable to perform daily tasks such as going to the store. This could be attributed to an illness, exhaustion, or a potentially serious medical condition. In such cases, the narrator would likely be concerned for the caller's well-being. 2. The narrator's response, \\"Are you serious?\\", can have various implications. Here are a few potential interpretations: a. The narrator could be genuinely concerned about the caller's well-being and shocked by the severity of their condition. In this case, \\"Are you serious?\\" might be an expression of disbelief or worry, prompting the caller to provide more information or confirm the severity of their condition. b. The narrator could be implying that the caller is lying or exaggerating. This could be due to past instances where the caller has made false or exaggerated claims, leading the narrator to question their truthfulness. c. The narrator could be sarcastic or dismissive, reflecting a perception that the caller is not actually as weak and tired as they claim to be. This could be due to the narrator's own temperament or a lack of empathy or understanding of the caller's situation. Considering the available choices: I. None of the above choices: The narrator could have a different perspective or understanding of the situation, but given the limited information provided, it cannot be derived. II. That he (the caller) is responsible: This choice suggests that the narrator thinks the caller brought the situation upon themselves, but this is not explicitly indicated in their response. III. That he (the caller) is lying: This is a possible interpretation, as the narrator's response \\"Are you serious?\\" could imply doubt about the caller's truthfulness. IV. That he (the caller) is truthful: This could also be a possibility if the narrator is interpreting \\"Are you serious?\\" as a genuine expression of surprise or concern for the caller's well-being. In conclusion, based on the information provided and the narrator's response, it cannot be definitively ascertained what the narrator thinks of the caller. However, the most likely options are that the narrator is either skeptical or genuinely concerned about the caller's well-being. To determine the narrator's thoughts with greater certainty, it would be necessary to gather further context and analyze their tone of voice, past interactions, and any additional information that might be relevant."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

D.C. election board prints upside-down flag on voter guide Elections officials changed their account late Thursday of how an upside-down flag came to be printed on the front of the official D.C. voter guide sent to hundreds of thousands of city households. On Thursday morning, the D.C. Board of Elections said the upside-down flag was part of a conscious ploy to generate voter interest in the election. But at around the same time, the board’s executive director told the D.C. Council that the graphic was an “error.” A staff member to D.C. Council member Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) inquired about the upside-down flag late Wednesday. On Thursday morning, Executive Director Clifford Tatum replied in an e-mail: “No, this is an error; checked with printer, not enough paper in stock or time to redo cover… we will message to voters that content is correct- graphic is wrong.” In a interview Thursday evening, Tatum said that the inverted flag was placed on the cover by a member of the board’s “design team,” who had stylized the logo in various ways during previous elections. “We have done different things with the flag in the past,” he said. “Her idea was the bars would be above the stars.” Tatum said he did not see the cover before it was sent to the printer. When he saw the finished product, he said he raised concerns about the upside-down flag, but by that point the books had already been printed and packaged — and so began the effort to couch the flag as a gimmick. “I read the content,” Tatum said. “I can’t say I paid attention to the cover. From cover to cover, it’s perfect. Would I have done something different with the bars and stars, certainly.” McDuffie is not pleased by the board’s latest snafu. “My impression is that this was not an intentional act, and it was an error,” he said Thursday. “And if it was intentional, then it was ridiculous that anyone would sanction that.” He laid the blame at Tatum’s feet: “You’ve got an executive director who needs to be held accountable for mistake after mistake in election after election. We have had problems through his tenure, and at some point, the buck needs to stop.” Tatum declined to comment on McDuffie’s statements. The 305,164 copies of the official D.C. voter guide started landing in mailboxes Wednesday ahead of the Nov. 4 general election. And the guide, issued by the D.C. Board of Elections, quickly turned into something of a social-media phenomenon — quite a feat for a publication full of sample ballots and voting instructions. The surfeit of useful information wasn’t what caught the public’s attention, however. REALLY, @DCBOEE?! REALLY?! RT @JTinDC: This upside down flag is why we can’t have nice elections. pic.twitter.com/OWHG72f3Wf Board spokeswoman Denise Tolliver said the upside-down flag was not, in fact, a mistake. Rather, Tolliver said, it was an effort to engage voters months after primary elections that saw record-low turnout. The idea, she said, was to put the voter guide on the board’s Web site with the inverted flag, prompt viewers to find the mistake, and “see how many clicks we can get.” There is no acknowledgment of the flag in the printed guide, and as of 10 a.m. Thursday, the online version had still not been posted. The flag gag comes as the board is dealing with public dismay over the slow counting of ballots after the April 1 primaries. Last month, board executive director Clifford Tatum said he could not guarantee that all the glitches have been ironed out and declined to promise when vote-counting would wrap up on election night. So why futz with something as seemingly straightforward as the voter guide? “It’s something we wanted to do to kind of engage people,” said Tolliver, who said the gimmick was “kind of a collective thing” but was ultimately approved by Tatum. “The turnout was just so low in April.” “People are responding, aren’t they?” she added. “They’re paying attention.

Options: - headaches - sidetracked - then have - disappointment - being happy Explain why a human would choose \\"headaches\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"headaches\\" to answer the question above because it is the most logical and fitting option among the given choices, based on common knowledge and experience with fumes and poor ventilation. The direct connection between inadequate ventilation, exposure to harmful fumes, and the development of headaches is founded on both scientific evidence and everyday observances. The explanations behind this rationale are as follows: 1. Chemical exposure: When a worker is exposed to fumes, they are essentially inhaling a mixture of gases, vapors, or fine particles that can be detrimental to their health. Typically, these fumes consist of chemicals that are emitted from substances such as solvents, paint, fuel, or other hazardous materials. Continuous exposure to these chemicals can cause headaches as they may disrupt the normal functioning of the human body. 2. Oxygen deficiency: Fumes and poor ventilation can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels in the surrounding air. This lack of oxygen can have a direct impact on the brain, as it cannot function optimally without an ample supply of oxygen. Consequently, the worker may experience headaches due to the brain's response to reduced oxygen levels. 3. Sensitivity and individual differences: Different individuals have varying sensitivities to different substances and environmental conditions. Some workers might be more susceptible to developing headaches when exposed to fumes, while others might not experience noticeable symptoms. In this specific scenario, the worker appears to be sensitive enough to the fumes that the inadequate ventilation causes them to experience headaches. The other options provided do not accurately address the question or fit into the context as effectively as \\"headaches.\\" For instance, \\"sidetracked\\" implies a difficulty in maintaining focus, but it does not clearly describe a direct consequence of being exposed to fumes in a poorly ventilated area. Similarly, \\"then have,\\" \\"disappointment,\\" and \\"being happy\\" are unrelated to the situation described and do not provide a reasonable outcome for the worker. In summary, a human would choose \\"headaches\\" to answer the question because it is the most plausible and fitting response, given the understanding of the effects of fumes and poor ventilation on human health. This choice is founded on the worker's exposure to harmful chemicals, reduced oxygen levels, and their individual sensitivity to these factors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Please answer this question : In which region stresses would not build in plates, region A or region B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information and hint, region B would be the area in which stresses do not build up in the plates. To provide a more detailed explanation, let us first understand the various aspects of the hint given and how they help us arrive at this conclusion: 1. Earthquakes and plate boundaries: The hint mentions that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, which are the areas where two or more tectonic plates meet. The Earth's crust is divided into several large tectonic plates that are constantly moving due to the convection currents within the Earth's mantle. As a result, various types of plate boundaries are formed, such as divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries, each manifesting different ways in which the plates interact. 2. Plate movements and stress build-up: The convection currents within the Earth cause the tectonic plates to move. This movement leads to the build-up of stress in the rocks present at plate boundaries. If the stress builds up too much, the rocks eventually break, releasing the stored energy - this is when an earthquake occurs. 3. Elastic rebound theory: This theory describes the process by which earthquakes occur. The stored stress from plate movement causes a strain on the rocks, and once the stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, they break, sending out seismic waves. During an earthquake, rocks usually move a few centimeters up to several meters in extreme cases. This movement and the release of energy constitute the elastic rebound. Now, let's analyze the information given about regions A and B: Region A experiences many earthquakes, which implies that it most likely contains active plate boundaries where stress is continuously building up due to tectonic plate movements. These high stress levels result in the release of energy in the form of earthquakes as described by the elastic rebound theory. On the other hand, region B does not experience earthquakes. This suggests that either the tectonic plates in this area are not moving or are moving so slowly that stresses do not build up sufficiently to cause rocks to break and result in an earthquake. In this case, region B corresponds to an area where stress in the plates does not build up to the point of causing earthquakes.

PARIS — His entourage calls him “the Prince,” and after the militant Islamist takeover of a town in northern Mali last year, he liked to go down to the river and watch the sunset, surrounded by armed bodyguards. Others call him “Laaouar,” or the One-Eyed, after he lost an eye to shrapnel; some call him “Mr. Marlboro” for the cigarette-smuggling monopoly he created across the Sahel region to finance his jihad. And French intelligence officials called him “the Uncatchable” because he escaped after apparently being involved in a series of kidnappings in 2003 that captured 32 European tourists, an undertaking which is thought to have earned him millions of dollars in ransoms. Mokhtar Belmokhtar, 40, born in the Algerian desert city of Ghardaïa, 350 miles south of Algiers, is now being called the mastermind of the hostage crisis at an internationally run natural-gas facility in eastern Algeria. Algerian officials say he mounted the assault and the mass abduction of foreigners; his spokesmen say the raid is in reprisal for the French intervention in Mali and for Algeria’s support for the French war against Islamist militants in the Sahel. Mr. Belmokhtar has been active in politics, moneymaking and fighting for decades in the Sahel, which includes Mali, Mauritania and Niger and is one of the poorest regions in the world. But through this single action, one of the most brazen kidnappings in years, he has suddenly become one of the best-known figures associated with the Islamist militancy sweeping the region and agitating capitals around the world. The 1989 killing in Pakistan of Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, a Palestinian considered the “father of global jihad” and a mentor of Osama bin Laden, prompted Mr. Belmokhtar to seek to avenge Mr. Azzam’s death, he has said in interviews. At 19 he traveled to Afghanistan for training with Al Qaeda, and has claimed in interviews to have made contact with other jihadi luminaries like Abu Qatada and Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, according to a 2009 Jamestown Foundation study. Bin Laden made contact with him, through emissaries, in the early 2000s, according to Djallil Lounnas, who teaches at Al Akhawayn University in Morocco. Mr. Belmokhtar later named a son Osama, after Bin Laden, and inserted himself into local populations in the southern Algerian and northern Malian desert by marrying the daughter of a prominent Arab leader from Timbuktu, Mali. He is also said to have shared the riches of his lucrative activities with the impoverished local population, Mr. Lounnas has written. Mr. Belmokhtar, described as taciturn, watchful and wary by a Malian journalist, Malick Aliou Maïga, who met him last summer, was one of the most experienced of the leaders of what became Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb until he broke with the group last year to form his own organization, the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, sometimes translated as the Signatories for Blood. Occasionally using the alias Khaled Abu Abass, he is thought to have based himself in Gao, Mali, which has seen heavy bombing by French warplanes. It was not clear whether Mr. Belmokhtar was at the scene or commanding the operation from afar. There are stories that he lost his eye fighting in Afghanistan, but others say he lost it fighting Algerian government troops after he returned to Algeria in 1993. The country was being ripped apart by civil war at the time, after the government annulled 1992 elections that were about to be won by an Islamist party. Mr. Belmokhtar has been a wanted man in Algeria since that time and condemned to death several times by Algerian courts. Mr. Belmokhtar was falsely reported to have been killed in 1999. Nearly a decade later, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, which he joined, adopted the jihadist ideology of Bin Laden and renamed itself Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Mr. Belmokhtar is considered to have been a key intermediary with Al Qaeda and a well-known supplier of weapons and matériel in the Sahara. But he clearly does not share authority easily, and left or was removed from his post as commander of a battalion in Mali last October, reportedly for “straying from the right path,” according to a Malian official, quoting the leader of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Abdelmalek Droukdel. The dispute was about Mr. Belmokhtar’s return to smuggling and trafficking. Dominique Thomas, a specialist in radical Islam, told Le Monde that Mr. Belmokhtar’s activities ran counter to the group’s official line, which presents itself as entirely virtuous. Mr. Belmokhtar then founded his new group, which he allied with the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, another Islamist group that had broken off from Al Qaeda. Some suggest that his expertise has been more in criminal activities than in holy warfare. Kidnapping and smuggling — of cigarettes, stolen cars, arms and drugs — have been his specialties in the vast and largely lawless border regions. He was said to be central to hostage-takings and subsequent negotiations for their release in 2003, 2008 and 2009. Robert R. Fowler, a former Canadian diplomat and a United Nations special envoy to Niger, was kidnapped by Mr. Belmokhtar’s brigade in late 2008 and met with him several times. “He’s a fairly slight, very serious, very confident-looking guy who moves with quiet authority,” Mr. Fowler said in a telephone interview from Canada. “He’s clearly been in the business of being a terrorist and surviving for a long time. I was always impressed by the quiet authority he exhibited.” Mr. Maïga, the Malian journalist, recalled seeing Mr. Belmokhtar, dressed in black and wearing a turban that descended over his eye, leaving a hospital in Gao with his entourage. He called out to him, and a bodyguard quickly interposed himself: “You must not,” the bodyguard warned. “That is the Prince.” Subsequently, Mr. Maïga recalled seeing Mr. Belmokhtar seated on the beach by the river at Gao, surrounded by bodyguards. “He was saying nothing. He has a fixed stare. He doesn’t trust people.” Mr. Maïga and others say locals regard him with both respect and fear. In an interview with the Mauritanian news agency Alakhbar in Gao in November, Mr. Belmokhtar said he respected “the clearly expressed choice” of the people of northern Mali “to apply Islamic Shariah law.” He warned against foreign interference, saying that any country that did so “would be considered as an oppressor and aggressor who is attacking a Muslim people applying Shariah on its territory.” Mr. Belmokhtar was already scheduled to be tried again in absentia by the Algiers criminal tribunal starting next Monday, on charges that include supplying weapons for attacks on Algerian soil. Planned targets were said to include pipelines and oil company installations in southern Mali. ||||| ALGIERS/IN AMENAS, Algeria More than 20 foreigners were captive or missing inside a desert gas plant on Saturday, nearly two days after the Algerian army launched an assault to free them that saw many hostages killed. The standoff between the Algerian army and al Qaeda-linked gunmen - one of the biggest international hostage crises in decades - entered its fourth day, having thrust Saharan militancy to the top of the global agenda. The number and fate of victims has yet to be confirmed, with the Algerian government keeping officials from Western countries far from the site where their countrymen were in peril. Reports put the number of hostages killed at between 12 to 30, with possibly dozens of foreigners still unaccounted for - among them Norwegians, Japanese, Britons, Americans and others. By nightfall on Friday, the Algerian military was holding the vast residential barracks at the In Amenas gas processing plant, while gunmen were holed up in the industrial plant itself with an undisclosed number of hostages. Scores of Westerners and hundreds of Algerian workers were inside the heavily fortified compound when it was seized before dawn on Wednesday by Islamist fighters who said they wanted a halt to a French military operation in neighboring Mali. Hundreds escaped on Thursday when the army launched an operation, but many hostages were killed in the assault. Algerian forces destroyed four trucks holding hostages, according to the family of a Northern Irish engineer who escaped from a fifth truck and survived. Leaders of Britain, Japan and other countries have expressed frustration that the assault was ordered without consultation and officials have grumbled at the lack of information. Many countries also withheld details about their missing citizens to avoid releasing information that might aid the captors. An Algerian security source said 30 hostages, including at least seven Westerners, had been killed during Thursday's assault, along with at least 18 of their captors. Eight of the dead hostages were Algerian, with the nationalities of the rest of the dead still unclear, he said. Algeria's state news agency APS put the total number of dead hostages at 12, including both foreigners and locals. The base was home to foreign workers from Britain's BP, Norway's Statoil and Japanese engineering firm JGC Corp and others. Norway says eight Norwegians are still missing. JGC said it was missing 10 staff. Britain and the United States have said they have citizens unaccounted for but have not said how many. The Algerian security source said 100 foreigners had been freed but 32 were still unaccounted for. \\"We must be prepared for bad news this weekend but we still have hope,\\" Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said. The attack has plunged international capitals into crisis mode and is a serious escalation of unrest in northwestern Africa, where French forces have been in Mali since last week fighting an Islamist takeover of Timbuktu and other towns. \\"We are still dealing with a fluid and dangerous situation where a part of the terrorist threat has been eliminated in one part of the site, but there still remains a threat in another part,\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron told his parliament. Two Japanese, two Britons and a French national were among the seven foreigners confirmed dead in the army's storming, the Algerian security source told Reuters. One British citizen was killed when the gunmen seized the hostages on Wednesday. \\"(The army) is still trying to achieve a ‘peaceful outcome' before neutralizing the terrorist group that is holed up in the (facility) and freeing a group of hostages that is still being held,\\" Algeria's state news agency said on Friday, quoting a security source. MULTINATIONAL INSURGENCY Algerian commanders said they moved in on Thursday about 30 hours after the siege began, because the gunmen had demanded to be allowed to take their captives abroad. A French hostage employed by a French catering company said he had hidden in his room for 40 hours under the bed before he was rescued by Algerian troops, relying on Algerian employees to smuggle him food with a password. \\"I put boards up pretty much all round,\\" Alexandre Berceaux told Europe 1 radio. \\"I didn't know how long I was going to stay there ... I was afraid. I could see myself already ending up in a pine box.\\" The captors said their attack was a response to the French military offensive in neighboring Mali. However, some U.S. and European officials say the elaborate raid probably required too much planning to have been organized from scratch in the single week since France first launched its strikes. Paris says the incident proves its decision to fight Islamists in neighboring Mali was necessary. Security in the half-dozen countries around the Sahara desert has long been a preoccupation of the West. Smugglers and militants have earned millions in ransom from kidnappings. The most powerful Islamist groups operating in the Sahara were severely weakened by Algeria's secularist military in a civil war in the 1990s. But in the past two years the regional wing of Al Qaeda gained fighters and arms as a result of the civil war in Libya, when arsenals were looted from Muammar Gaddafi's army. Al Qaeda-linked fighters, many with roots in Algeria and Libya, took control of northern Mali last year, prompting the French intervention in that poor African former colony. The apparent ease with which the fighters swooped in from the dunes to take control of an important energy facility, which produces some 10 percent of the natural gas on which Algeria depends for its export income, has raised questions over the value of outwardly tough Algerian security measures. Algerian officials said the attackers may have had inside help from among the hundreds of Algerians employed at the site. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said those responsible would be hunted down: \\"Terrorists should be on notice that they will find no sanctuary, no refuge, not in Algeria, not in North Africa, not anywhere... Those who would wantonly attack our country and our people will have no place to hide.\\" (Additional reporting by Ali Abdelatti in Cairo, Eamonn Mallie in Belfast, Gwladys Fouche in Oslo, Mohammed Abbas in London and Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries in Dublin; Writing by Philippa Fletcher and Peter Graff; Editing by Andrew Roche and Tom Pfeiffer) ||||| Image caption The remote desert gas facility is not far from the Libyan border Islamist militants are believed to be still holding a number of hostages at a gas facility in the Algerian desert. At least four foreign workers and several militants died on Thursday when troops stormed the living quarters. The militants had claimed to be holding 41 foreigners. At least four were freed but the fate of many others is unknown. Meanwhile, BP said hundreds of workers from international oil companies had been evacuated from Algeria on Thursday and that many more would follow. Analysis This was one of the most complex hostage situations seen in many years - one in which hopes for a simple, bloodless resolution always looked optimistic. The combination of a remote site in the desert, heavily armed militants, explosives at a gas facility and a kaleidoscope of nations with their citizens held hostage was always a volatile cocktail. However, there will still be questions about Algeria's decisions, particularly its reported reluctance to accept any advice or assistance. The countries whose nationals were being held may all have called for caution, but the Algerians were always going to be the key decision makers. It was their territory and many of their citizens were held hostage. They have a record of taking a tough, no-holds-barred approach. And given this was the first attack on a gas facility which provides the country's economic lifeblood they may have wanted to send a tough message to those considering repeating this. Algeria has yet to give precise casualty figures from the rescue attempt. The state-run APS news agency cited local officials as saying two Britons and two Filipinos were killed. Two others, a Briton and an Algerian, died on Wednesday when the militants ambushed a bus that was taking foreign workers at the facility to the local airport. A spokesman for the militants told the Mauritanian ANI news agency that 35 hostages and 15 militants had been killed in Thursday's operation. One Algerian official said the figures were \\"exaggerated\\". The In Amenas gas field is operated by the Algerian state oil company, Sonatrach, along with the British oil company BP and Norway's Statoil. It is situated at Tigantourine, about 40km (25 miles) south-west of the town of In Amenas and 1,300km (800 miles) south-east of Algiers. 'Surrounded' On Friday morning, the UK Foreign Office and Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said they believed the incident was ongoing. \\"Parts of the plant are under Algerian authorities' control, and other parts are not. This information is changing by the hour,\\" Mr Eide told the BBC. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron tells MPs that British citizens remain at risk, but that the number has been “significantly reduced” APS cited local officials as saying the military operation at the gas facility's living quarters, where most of the hostages were held, had ended on Thursday night. \\"Hostages are still being held at the Tigantourine gas treatment plant, which is surrounded by special forces,\\" APS added. Later, UK Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that he had been told by his Algerian counterpart, Abdelmalek Sellal, that troops were \\"still pursuing terrorists and possibly some of the hostages\\". \\"They are now looking at all possible routes to resolve this crisis,\\" he added, describing the situation as \\"fluid and dangerous\\". Mr Cameron also revealed that on Thursday night, the number of British citizens at risk had been fewer than 30, but that it had now been \\"quite significantly reduced\\". Later, a British plane carrying an emergency deployment team had arrived at the Hassi Messaoud airport, about 300 miles (480km) north-west of Amenas, the Foreign Office said. Japanese officials were meanwhile cited as saying by the Kyodo news agency that at least 14 Japanese nationals were still missing. At least three managed to escape. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, expressed \\"deep regret\\" at the actions of the Algerian security forces and its foreign ministry summoned the Algerian ambassador. Despite requests for communication and pleas to consider the hostages' safety, the UK, Japan and US said they had not been told in advance about the military assault. Mr Cameron said the Algerian prime minister had told him that commanders had \\"judged there to be an immediate threat to the lives of the hostages and had felt obliged to respond\\". Algerian Communications Minister Mohand Said Oubelaid said: \\"Those who think we will negotiate with terrorists are delusional.\\" Norway said eight of its nationals were currently unaccounted for. One is being treated at a hospital in In Amenas, while four escaped unharmed.

It was unclear if another two were involved, he added. The Irish government confirmed that one of its citizens was free. Five Americans had survived and left the country, US officials told ABC News. Austria also said one of its nationals had been released and was safe. APS said about 600 local workers had been freed in the raid, but many were reportedly allowed to leave on Wednesday by the militants. A worker from CIS Catering, which employs about 150 Algerians at the facility, told French media he had hidden under the bed in his room for 40 hours before being rescued. \\"I put boards everywhere. I had food, water, and I did not know how long I would stay there.\\" Foreign citizens involved Fourteen Japanese missing Eight Norwegians missing Significantly fewer than 30 Britons \\"at risk\\"; two Britons (from Scotland) believed to be safe Unknown number of Americans Possibly citizens of Romania, Thailand, the Philippines, Colombia, South Korea and Austria Two French citizens safe One Irish citizen from Northern Ireland safe One Kenyan safe One Austrian safe Q&A: Hostage crisis in Algeria Press links Algerian crisis with Mali operation \\"When the soldiers came to get me, I did not even know it was over. They were with colleagues, otherwise I would never have opened the door,\\" he added. A statement purporting to come from the kidnappers says the raid was carried out in retaliation for the French intervention against Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), in neighbouring Mali. But BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says the kidnapping was a complex operation which is unlikely to have been planned and carried out since the surprising French intervention in Mali last Friday. Mr Oubelaid said the militants were intent on \\"destabilising Algeria, embroiling it in the Mali conflict and damaging its natural gas infrastructure.\\" Algerian officials said they were operating under orders from Mokhtar Belmokhtar, who was a senior AQIM commander until late last year. On Friday morning, a spokesman for al-Mulathameen (The Brigade of the Masked Ones) told ANI that it would carry out further operations. He warned Algerians to \\"stay away from the installations of foreign companies as we will strike where it is least expected\\". ||||| “This is an extremely difficult and dangerous situation,” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters in Washington. Describing a conversation she had earlier Friday with Algeria’s prime minister, Abdelmalek Sellal, Mrs. Clinton said she had emphasized to him that “the utmost care must be taken to preserve innocent life.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Algeria’s state news agency, APS, said 12 Algerian and foreign workers had been killed since Algerian special forces began an assault against the kidnappers on Thursday. It was the highest civilian death toll Algerian officials that have provided in the aftermath of the assault, which freed captives and killed kidnappers but also left some hostages dead in one of the worst mass abductions of foreign workers in years. Previous unofficial estimates of the foreign casualties have ranged from 4 to 35. The American who died, Mr. Buttaccio, lived in a gated community in Katy, a suburb that is about 30 miles west of downtown Houston.The Algerian news agency also said that 18 militants had been killed and that the country’s special forces were dealing with remnants of a “terrorist group” that was still holding hostages in the refinery area of the gas field in remote eastern Algeria. It also gave a new sense of how many people may have been at the facility when the militants seized it on Wednesday, asserting that nearly 650 had managed to leave the site since then, including 573 Algerians and nearly half of the 132 foreigners it said had been abducted. But that still left many people unaccounted for. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The senior Algerian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he believed there were about 10 hostages, under the control of possibly 13 to 15 militants, but he emphasized that “nothing is certain” about the numbers, which have varied wildly since the crisis began. He also said that there were other workers on the site “who are still in hiding” but that the Algerian military had secured the residential part of the gas-field complex. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “What remains are a few terrorists, holding a few hostages, who have taken refuge in the gas factory,” he said. “It’s a site that’s very tricky to handle.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The official also challenged the criticism made in some foreign capitals that the Algerian military had acted hastily and with excessive force. On the contrary, he said, Algerian forces had returned fire only as the militants sought to escape the complex with their captives. “There was a reaction by the army,” he said. “They tried to flee and they were stopped,” the official said of the militants. “They came absolutely to blow the whole site up. These are bitter-enders.” Earlier Friday, the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said that not all Americans had been freed. “We have American hostages,” she said, offering the first update on what was known about United States citizens since officials confirmed on Thursday that seven or eight of them had been inside the gas-field complex. Photo Ms. Nuland also said the United States would not consider a reported offer made by the kidnappers to exchange two Americans for two prominent figures imprisoned in the United States — Omar Abdel Rahman, a sheik convicted of plotting to bomb New York landmarks, and Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman convicted of shooting at two American soldiers in Afghanistan. It was impossible to confirm that offer, which was reported by the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group, a service that tracks jihadist activity on the Internet. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Intensifying the uncertainties, a spokesman for the militants, who belong to a group called Al Mulathameen, said Friday that they planned further attacks in Algeria, according to a report by the Mauritanian news agency ANI, which maintains frequent contact with militant groups in the region. The spokesman called upon Algerians to “keep away from the installations of foreign companies because we will suddenly attack where no one would expect it,” ANI reported. The Algerian military operation to end the gas-field siege was done without consulting foreign governments whose citizens worked at the facility. It has been marked by a fog of conflicting reports, compounded by the remoteness of the facility, near a town called In Amenas that is hundreds of miles across the desert from the Algerian capital, Algiers, and close to the Libyan border.

In London, Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the number of Britons at risk was estimated late Thursday at “less than 30.” That number has now been “quite significantly reduced,” he said, adding that he could not give details because the crisis was continuing. British officials have said they know at least one Briton was killed when the militants seized the facility.

I was told by the Algerian prime minister while it was taking place. He said that the terrorists had tried to flee, that they judged there to be an immediate threat to the lives of the hostages and had felt obliged to respond.” In Paris, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed for the first time that a French citizen had been killed, although it was not clear exactly when. The victim, whom Mr. Fabius identified as Yann Desjeux, had contacted relatives as recently as noon Thursday, according to the French newspaper Sud Ouest, which also said it had spoken with Mr. Desjeux. Three other French citizens were involved in the hostage situation but are now safe, Mr. Fabius said.

But details were sketchy. A senior French official in Paris said Malian Islamist fighters, threatened by French and Malian soldiers, had occupied the village, Diabaly, and were threatening to use residents as human shields if attacked. But by Friday evening, a local official in Diabaly said the Islamists and most of the villagers had fled. “There’s practically nothing left in Diabaly except burned-out vehicles and boxes of ammunition,” said the official, Benco Ba, a local parliamentary deputy.

Hostages and analysts have said the attackers appeared well-prepared and deeply knowledgeable about the site, and there was evidence to suggest they had informers on the site or were in contact with workers there. An official at BP indicated earlier in the week that the attackers had shut off production at the site at the time of the attack, for instance. And at least two former hostages, interviewed independently, have said the fighters were aware of labor tensions and plans for a strike among catering workers on the site.

The U.S., U.K. and Japan, whose nationals were among those held, said they had urged the Algerians not to resort to force to free the hostages, who were taken Wednesday by militants with suspected ties to al Qaeda's regional affiliate. The U.S. and U.K. received no warning that the raid was beginning, officials from the countries said. \\"Before the raid began, we urged the Algerians to be cautious and strongly encouraged them to make the safety of the hostages their top priority,\\" an Obama administration official told The Wall Street Journal. Some foreign hostages were killed when forces raided the southeast Algerian natural-gas facility, called In Amenas, an Algerian government official confirmed. He didn't elaborate. Algerian officials have told their American and European counterparts that news reports of the number of hostages killed at the site were vastly exaggerated, saying the number was likely close to 11 or 12, according to U.S. and Western officials. The Algerian official said only that at least four engineers had been freed. An Irish hostage is safe and has made contact with his family, the Irish government said. By late Thursday, with details sparse and often contradictory, most governments with citizens at the site said they were unable to offer casualty numbers or account for their missing. U.S. officials said they believe as many as eight Americans were among the hostages. But officials have so far been unable to independently corroborate how many were killed in the raid, White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. \\"Reports of casualties are all over the map,\\" he said. Even if Americans aren't among the casualties, U.S. officials worried that the siege pointed to a new era of terrorist attacks on Western interests in loosely governed regions, particularly in energy-rich parts of Africa. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that the hostage crisis illustrated the growing threat of Islamic extremism in northern Africa and the need for the U.S. to coordinate closely with African and European countries to combat it. Playing out deep in Algeria's desert, the drama focuses international attention on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, and related groups that have spread across a vast territory that encompasses parts of Mali, Algeria, Libya and Chad. Members of AQIM claimed responsibility for Wednesday's hostage-taking, which they branded retaliation after France sent combat troops last week to support neighboring Mali in its battle against al Qaeda-backed militants. A Briton and an Algerian were killed in Wednesday's militant attack, Algeria's Interior Ministry has said. Nationals of nearly a dozen countries were among the hostages, with Norway, Austria and France also among those confirming that their citizens were held. The In Amenas project, a partnership between U.K.-traded BP PLC, Norway's Statoil and Algerian energy company Sonatrach, employs some 600 people, according to BP. Thursday's action by the Algerians was its second attempt in as many days to free the hostages. U.S. officials said Algeria didn't give the White House warning before it launched the raid. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron also hadn't been informed of the operation beforehand, according to a spokesman for Mr. Cameron, who added that the prime minister lodged a personal protest Thursday with his Algerian counterpart. As the raid unfolded, Mr. Cameron postponed a highly anticipated speech on Britain's role in the European Union. \\"It is a very dangerous, a very uncertain and a very fluid situation,\\" Mr. Cameron, speaking with British Broadcasting Corp., said of the battle. \\"I think we have to prepare ourselves for the possibility of bad news ahead.\\" Algeria defended its decision to strike at the militants. The government took all necessary measures to reach a favorable ending, the country's press agency quoted Algerian communications minister Mohammed Said as saying. But the \\"radicalism of terrorists\\" had forced the army into launching an assault, he said, according to the Algerian agency, APS. \\"An important number of\\" the suspected militants who seized hostages at the site on Wednesday were \\"neutralized\\" by ground forces during the assault, he said. A spokesman for the militants said his group had been trying to transport some of the hostages to a more secure location but they were hit by Algerian airstrikes, according to the Mauritanian news agency ANI. As of late Thursday, the battle between Algerian forces and militants continued, APS reported. Contradicting an earlier report that the raid had ended in full, the agency cited local officials as saying operations had been completed only at a living quarters at the facility, where most of the hostages had been held. But a half mile away at the site—which satellite images and company photos reveal as a vast ochre-tinged plain, flanked by sand dunes and interrupted by the occasional tall metal crane and chimney—militants holding a smaller number of hostages were being surrounded by the army, APS reported. U.S. officials couldn't confirm whether the operation was continuing. They said the U.S. military had deployed an unmanned drone over the gas field but that the images captured by the drone didn't provide a clear picture of the status of the hostages. The attack also highlighted worries over a geopolitical risk that could threaten oil and gas operations. The attack shut down production of In Amenas, a major field which, at full capacity, could produce nine billion cubic meters of gas a year and 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day of liquids. Oil prices rose 1.25 to close at 95.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Thursday. Italian gas company Snam SpA said Thursday it has registered a drop of more than 13% in imports of gas from a pipeline coming from Algeria since the attack early Wednesday. Risks to foreign energy companies operating in Algeria have improved since the 1990s civil war, but remain high, particularly along Algeria's coast. In contrast, the southern desert area where most of Algeria's oil- and gas-producing facilities are located are guarded by the Algerian army and security forces. This week's large-scale attacks marks a worrying break in peaceful operations there, said experts on the region. Representatives from Statoil and BP said the companies had decided to bring employees home from other facilities in Algeria. Statoil's CEO said three flights will bring 40 employees home Thursday night. BP officials declined to comment on the crisis late Thursday. Earlier in the day, it said it had been informed by the U.K. and Algerian governments of the raid but that it lacked reliable information and awaited updates from authorities. Statoil Chief Executive Helge Lund said the company couldn't comment on the status of all 17 employees who were at In Amenas field and was worried about their well-being. Into the night, families of Statoil hostages gathered at a hotel outside of Bergen on the Norwegian west coast, waiting for news. Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, said four Norwegian hostages were safe outside the In Amenas facility, while nine remained unaccounted for. Speaking during a press conference, Mr. Stoltenberg said he was informed by Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal at midday that military action was under way. Mr. Stoltenberg said he told Mr. Sellal that hostage safety was the top priority. \\"The Algerian PM told me they had tried to find a solution during the night, but had not succeeded, so they had no other choice\\" than to attack, he said, adding that Algeria had had to make a tough decision. —Kjetil Malkenes Hovland, Jay Solomon, Selina Williams, James Herron and Jared Favole contributed to this article.

Today, we are going to talk about two important people from history – Francis IV and Vincent I. We are going to find out who died first between them. But first, let us learn a little about who they were. Francis IV was a Duke, which means he was like a big leader or boss of a place called Modena and Reggio in a country called Italy. He lived a long time ago, from 1779 to 1846. That's over 170 years ago! He was a good ruler and took care of the people in his land. Now, let's talk about Vincent I. He was a King, just like in the fairy tales you love! He was the King of a beautiful place called Portugal. He lived even longer ago than Francis IV, from 1394 to 1438. As a king, he made sure that his kingdom was peaceful and the people were happy. Now that we know a little about these two important people, we can find out who died first. Remember the years they lived? Francis IV lived from 1779 to 1846, while Vincent I lived from 1394 to 1438. To know who died first, simply look at the years they left us. Vincent I died in 1438, which is a long, long time ago. Francis IV died much later, in 1846. So, when we compare these years, we can say that Vincent I died first. So, little friends, now we know the answer! Between Francis IV and Vincent I, it was Vincent I who died first. We can also understand that they lived in different times in history, and both played essential roles as rulers in their countries. I hope you enjoyed learning about Francis IV and Vincent I.

Answer:","completion":"Group B likely relies on confusing potential predators. This is because they live in very large groups, and when they move around, they all move at the same time. This coordinated movement can create confusion for predators, making it more difficult for them to single out and target an individual prey. The larger group size can also create a visual confusion, known as the \\"dazzle effect,\\" making it harder for predators to focus on one specific animal.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: pincers","completion":"Given that the task is not clearly defined, it is impossible to suggest a specific solution without adequate context. Pincers as a tool are used for various purposes, ranging from picking, gripping, and cutting to bending and manipulating materials. Hence, without knowing the targeted application, it would not be fair to recommend a solution. To provide a comprehensive response, we can discuss the different types of pincers and their general uses to help you decide which one might be better suited to your specific goal: 1) Needle-nose pincers: Needle-nose pincers, also known as long-nose or pointy-nose pliers, possess a long and tapered gripping surface. This design is ideal for precision work, particularly in challenging-to-reach spaces. Their primary applications involve bending or manipulating wire and retrieving small items. Needle-nose pincers are commonly used in jewelry making, electronics, and various crafting projects. 2) Flat-nose pincers: Flat-nose pincers have wide and flat gripping surfaces. They provide secure grasping of a range of materials and are particularly useful for bending, gripping, and flattening objects. Flat-nose pincers are frequently used in jewelry making and wirework for their steady hold and versatile functionality. 3) Round-nose pincers: Round-nose pincers have smooth, rounded gripping surfaces allowing for the easy bending and shaping of wire, particularly in creating loops or intricate twists. They are commonly used in jewelry making, crafting, and sculpture work. 4) End-cutting pincers: End-cutting pincers, also known as end cutters or nippers, are designed for cutting wire, pins, or nails. The cutting edges are positioned at the tip of the pincers, making them efficient at snipping wire flush against a surface or trimming nails. This type of pincer is commonly utilized in woodworking, electrical work, or construction. 5) Diagonal-cutting pincers: Diagonal-cutting pincers or diagonal cutters are similar to end-cutting pincers but with their cutting edges set at an angle. They effortlessly cut wires, cables, and other softer materials and are used widely in electrical work, automotive repair, and hobby projects. 6) Tongue-and-groove pincers: Tongue-and-groove pincers, also referred to as water pump pliers or groove joint pliers, are adjustable and designed for clamping or holding irregularly shaped objects. They are extensively utilized in plumbing, automotive, and general maintenance tasks. 7) Locking pincers: Locking pincers, or vise grips, include a locking mechanism that clamps onto an item, giving a secure hold without the need for constant manual pressure. These pincers are primarily used in welding, automotive repair, and general maintenance. Ultimately, the \\"better\\" solution depends on your specific goal or task at hand. If your goal is precision work, needle-nose pincers might be a better option. Conversely, if your objective is to cut wires or nails, end-cutting pincers would be more appropriate. Assess your task and intended use to guide your choice of the most suitable pincer for the job."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence from a movie review: real star Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"It's not possible to determine whether the movie was seen positively or negatively based on just the sentence provided: \\"real star.\\" This phrase alone does not give sufficient information about the reviewer's thoughts, feelings, or opinions about the movie. To accurately assess the reviewer's stance and provide a well-rounded answer, more context is needed. A well-written movie review often includes essential elements like a synopsis of the movie plot, a description of the main characters' performances, the director's choices, visual and sound effects, and the overall message of the film. Furthermore, the reviewer usually shares their thoughts on how the elements come together, and whether they enjoyed the movie or found it lacking in any aspects. Without access to such details from the review, it is impossible to provide a definite answer regarding the movie's reception. However, if we were to solely focus on the term \\"real star,\\" it could be interpreted in several ways: the reviewer could be praising the performance of a particular actor in the movie or highlighting the outstanding visuals or music as the true standout of the film. It could also be seen as a phrase to recognize someone's behind-the-scenes contribution, such as the director or writer, that stood out among other elements.

Question: Where are regulations codified into? Answer: Many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations, which are published in the Federal Register and codified into the Code of Federal Regulations. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Yes, the question was answered in a satisfactory fashion, but I can provide a more detailed and long answer for better understanding. Regulations, also known as administrative laws or rules, are created by executive branch agencies and are necessary for the effective implementation and enforcement of statutes passed by the legislative branch. These regulations are designed to clarify or give further guidance to the legislation they are based on and have a direct impact on the general public, businesses, and other organizations. Regulations in the United States are published in the Federal Register, which is a daily publication containing new rules, proposed rules, and other notices from federal agencies. Before being published in the Federal Register, a process known as rulemaking is followed. This process involves several stages, including: 1. Notice of proposed rulemaking: The agency developing the new regulation drafts a proposed rule and publishes it in the Federal Register to give the public an opportunity to review and provide comments. 2. Public comment period: Interested parties can submit comments on the proposal, providing input, suggestions, or concerns about the proposed regulation. This is a vital part of the rulemaking process as it allows for stakeholders' involvement in the shaping of the regulation. 3. Review and analysis: After the comment period, the agency reviews the input received and may make changes to the proposed rule based on that feedback. The agency may also conduct further research, cost-benefit analyses, or environmental impact assessments, as necessary. 4. Final rule: Once the agency has thoroughly considered the comments and carried out additional analyses, they issue a final rule, which is published in the Federal Register and becomes legally binding. Upon publication in the Federal Register, these regulations are also organized and codified into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The CFR is a comprehensive collection of all federal regulations divided into 50 titles, each covering a specific topic, such as Title 21 for Food and Drugs or Title 40 for Protection of the Environment. Each title is further divided into chapters, parts, and sections to facilitate easy navigation and referencing. Regulations are subject to review by the courts, and they can be challenged for various reasons, such as if an agency has exceeded its statutory authority or if the regulation contradicts the intent of the governing legislation. In summary, regulations are codified into the Code of Federal Regulations after a detailed rulemaking process involving public input and agency analyses. These regulations, derived from statutes and created by executive branch agencies, allow for the practical implementation and enforcement of laws in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, we have to find out how many \\"v\\" sets of apples we need to make the puzzle work. First, let's add the apples together: (-692 * v) + (331 * v) + (308 * v) = -63 * v So, now our math puzzle looks like this: 0 = -63 * v + 1007 Next, let's move the 1007 from one side to the other.

The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal without any other player touching it, the result is a corner kick to the opposing side. Likewise an offensive goal cannot be scored directly from a throw in; the result in this case is a goal kick for the defending team.

Understand the given text: The text states that a goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in for both teams. If a player throws the ball directly into their own goal without any other player touching it, the opposing side gets a corner kick. Similarly, if a player throws the ball directly into the opponent's goal without any other player touching it, the defending team gets a goal kick. 2. Analyze the statement: The statement is asking whether a goal scored from a throw-in counts. 3. Compare the statement and the given text: According to the given text, a goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in. Therefore, a goal from a throw-in will not count if the ball goes directly into the goal without touching any other player.

Q:Information: - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - The National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was the first organization governing American baseball. The first convention of sixteen New York City area clubs in 1857 practically terminated the Knickerbocker era, when that club privately deliberated on the rules of the game. The last convention, with hundreds of members represented only via state associations, provoked the establishment of separate professional and amateur associations in 1871. The succeeding National Association of Professional Base Ball Players is considered the first professional sports league; through 1875 it governed professional baseball and practically set playing rules for all. Because the amateur successor never attracted many members and it convened only a few times, the NABBP is sometimes called \\"the amateur Association\\" in contrast to its professional successor. - A professional is a member of a profession or any person who earns their living from a specified professional activity. The term also describes the standards of education and training that prepare members of the profession with the particular knowledge and skills necessary to perform their specific role within that profession. In addition, most professionals are subject to strict codes of conduct, enshrining rigorous ethical and moral obligations. Professional standards of practice and ethics for a particular field are typically agreed upon and maintained through widely recognized professional associations, such as the IEEE. Some definitions of \\"professional\\" limit this term to those professions that serve some important aspect of public interest and the general good of society. - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\". - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - The Mutual Base Ball Club of New York was a leading American baseball club almost throughout its 20 - year history . It was established during 1857 , the year of the first baseball convention , just too late to be a founding member of the National Association of Base Ball Players . It was a charter member of both the first professional league in 1871 and the National League in 1876 . Failing on the field and in the coffer , it declined to make its last western trip of the inaugural season . For the transgression it was expelled in December , and soon found itself defunct . The Mutual club initially played its home games at Elysian Fields in Hoboken , with the New York Knickerbockers and many other Manhattan clubs , but moved to the enclosed Union Grounds in Brooklyn in 1868 . The Mutuals chose open professionalism in 1869 -- 70 after NABBP liberalization . They joined the first professional league , the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players , for its 1871 to 1875 duration . In 1876 , the Chicago White Stockings initiated the National League and recruited its members from West to East , partly to wrest control of professional baseball from Eastern interests . The Mutuals were one of eight charter members , six of whom were from the National Association . Weak ( sixth place at 21 -- 35 ) and cash - poor , the club refused to complete its playing obligations in the West ; and was expelled . On May 13 , 1876 , the Mutuals executed the first triple play in major - league history in a game against the Hartford Dark Blues . Union Grounds proprietor William Cammeyer , often listed today as the Mutual club owner , signed the Hartford Dark Blues to play at his Union Grounds in 1877 . The team was effectively a one - year replacement for the defunct Mutuals , and was sometimes called \`\` Hartford of Brooklyn '' .

British and Swiss researchers conducted a study showing that advertisements featuring endorsements by celebrities like David Beckham and Scarlett Johansson are not as effective as those by ordinary people. The difference is that regular people prefer to purchase goods that are bought by other regular people. In s sample of 298 university students, researchers presented a magazine advertisement for a digital camera that included an endorsement by an imaginary student saying the camera was \\"hot\\" and his \\"preferred choice.\\" The same advertisement was shown to other students, but with a difference:the camera was endorsed by a famous person in Germany. The researchers also measured how important it was for consumers that the purchased products make a good impression on others. While the students said that both advertisements were beneficial, the one made by the student topped the celebrity one if students aimed to impress others with their purchases. More than half of the students, who admitted to purchasing products that would impress others, said they were influenced by the student advertisement. Only 20% said the celebrity one would affect their buying decision. For those who do not buy to impress, only 5% focused on the student advertisement. Professor Brett Martin from the University of Bath's School of Management, explained that the findings can be used not only in Germany, but in other countries as well. \\"Our re-search questions whether celebrities are the best way to sell products,\\" said Mr. Martin.\\"Celebrities can be effective but we found that many people were more convinced by an endorsement from an ordinary person.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies.

The sentence describes a situation in which Mr. Bond, who is identified as a veterinarian, is examining an injured black horse. When the pronoun \\"he\\" is used in this context, it is referring to Mr. Bond, and is functioning as a pronoun to avoid repetitive use of the proper noun \\"Mr. Bond.\\" Allow me to break down the structure of the sentence to provide a clearer understanding: 1. \\"When Mr. Bond, the veterinarian, came to look at the black horse that lay groaning on the grass,\\" - This part of the sentence sets the scene and introduces Mr. Bond as the main character in the situation being described. It provides context by stating that he is a veterinarian, and the purpose of his visit is to examine an injured black horse, which is lying down and groaning. 2. \\"he felt him all over,\\" - In this part of the sentence, \\"he\\" refers back to Mr. Bond, as he is the only identified male character in the sentence so far. The pronoun \\"he\\" is used here to maintain sentence flow and avoid repetitively stating Mr. Bond's name. The \\"him\\" in this part of the sentence refers to the black horse, indicating that Mr. Bond is palpating or physically examining the horse. 3. \\"and shook his head;\\" - Again, \\"his\\" in this part of the sentence refers to Mr. Bond. This phrase suggests that he is expressing concern or disapproval based on his assessment of the horse's condition. 4. \\"one of his legs was broken.\\" - Finally, \\"his\\" in this part of the sentence refers to the black horse. This reveals the result of Mr. Bond's examination and shares the specific issue with the horse, which is a broken leg. In conclusion, within the context of the presented sentence, \\"he\\" and \\"Mr. Bond\\" indeed refer to the same person. The pronoun \\"he\\" serves as a substitution for the proper noun \\"Mr. Bond\\" to create a smoother reading experience while maintaining the intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit \\"Journey to the Center of the Mind\\" (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo (1978).

Here is the verse you provided, now with added punctuation: \\"8:12. He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him, to sanctify him.\\" Adding punctuation to the above verse helps to clarify its meaning. In biblical times, anointing with oil had deep symbolic significance. By pouring oil on Aaron's head, Moses was setting him apart for God's service. The oil represented the Holy Spirit, and signified the divine consecration needed to fulfill the priestly role. This act also showed that Aaron received special authority, as well as the responsibility to lead the people in their spiritual and religious practices. The anointing served as a visible sign of Aaron's (and subsequently his descendants') call to be the high priest. By sanctifying Aaron through anointing, Moses also consecrated the priesthood, which would be passed down through generations within the tribe of Levi. The priesthood played a central role in the spiritual life of Israel, representing the people before God and performing sacrifices, prayers, and other religious duties on their behalf. At the same time, the anointing of Aaron symbolizes the importance of submitting to God's guidance and acknowledging His presence in our lives. In essence, it serves as a reminder that the true source of authority and power does not come from ourselves, but rather from God. In conclusion, the anointing of Aaron with oil demonstrates the divine appointment to his role as high priest, establishing the sanctity and holiness of this position. The act of anointing represents submission to God's will and consecration for spiritual service, highlighting the essential role faith plays within the religious life of the community. By adding the necessary punctuation to the verse, the meaning becomes clearer, emphasizing the deep spiritual significance behind the anointing of Aaron."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo GOP senators recommend FBI probe of Trump 'dossier' author Steele Sens. Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham tell the FBI that former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele made false statements to investigators. Two Republican senators have recommended that the FBI pursue a criminal investigation against Christopher Steele — the author of the disputed Trump-Russia dossier — for what they described as evidence that he made false statements to federal investigators. \\"I don’t take lightly making a referral for criminal investigation. But, as I would with any credible evidence of a crime unearthed in the course of our investigations, I feel obliged to pass that information along to the Justice Department for appropriate review,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said in a joint statement with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Story Continued Below The senators did not provide public evidence to substantiate their request, but they noted they sent a \\"classified memorandum\\" to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray containing the basis of their request. The request does not assess the validity of the Steele dossier, nor does it constitute a criminal allegation. \\"The referral is for further investigation only,\\" according to the statement. Even so, Democrats quickly responded in anger. \\"I wasn’t consulted about this referral nor were any of my Democratic colleagues,\\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on Grassley's committee. \\"I think this referral is unfortunate as it’s clearly another effort to deflect attention from what should be the committee’s top priority: determining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election and whether there was subsequent obstruction of justice.\\" One congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision by Grassley and Graham to refer Steele to the Justice Department raises an obvious anomaly. \\"They are referring to DOJ a criminal prosecution based on documents DOJ gave them and based on witness testimony to the DOJ,\\" the aide said. Steele, a former British intelligence officer, was commissioned in 2016 by research firm Fusion GPS to investigate President Donald Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier he produced, which Trump has derided as fiction, describes years of illicit connections between Trump, his business and the Kremlin.

Republicans have persistently questioned how the FBI handled the dossier after receiving it during the 2016 campaign, including whether it formed the basis of a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign associate and whether the FBI independently verified any of Steele's information. Republicans have also sounded the alarm over reports that Fusion was paid by the Clinton campaign for Steele's research, suggesting that Steele's work was the product of a partisan smear effort. The two senators claim in their letter to have seen evidence of \\"potential violations\\" by Steele of a law prohibiting false statements to government officials. These potential violations, they say, occurred \\"regarding his distribution of information contained in the dossier.\\" Their letter was copied to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, as well as Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Reps. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top lawmakers on the House Intelligence ommittee. ||||| WASHINGTON — More than a year after Republican leaders promised to investigate Russian interference in the presidential election, two influential Republicans on Friday made the first known congressional criminal referral in connection with the meddling — against one of the people who sought to expose it. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a senior committee member, told the Justice Department that they had reason to believe that a former British spy, Christopher Steele, lied to federal authorities about his contacts with reporters regarding information in a dossier, and they urged the department to investigate. The committee is running one of three congressional investigations into Russian election meddling, and its inquiry has come to focus on, in part, Mr. Steele’s explosive dossier that purported to detail Russia’s interference and the Trump campaign’s complicity. The decision by Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham to single out the former intelligence officer behind the dossier infuriated Democrats and raised the stakes in the growing partisan battle over the investigations into Mr. Trump, his campaign team and Russia. The Senate Judiciary Committee effort played into a far broader campaign waged by conservatives to cast doubt on the Trump-Russia investigations, and instead turn the veracity of the dossier and the credibility of its promulgators into the central issue. At the same time, President Trump and his allies have demanded that the Justice Department reopen its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server and the Clinton Foundation. F.B.I. agents have begun interviewing people connected to the foundation about whether any donations were made in exchange for political favors while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. ||||| The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Friday that the Justice Department investigate for possible criminal charges the author of the now-famous dossier alleging the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin during the 2016 election. The move by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) marks a major escalation in conservatives' challenges to the FBI's credibility as the agency investigates whether any Trump associates committed crimes. Another Republican, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), joined in the letter to the Justice Department. Their letter makes what is called a criminal referral to the Justice Department, suggesting it investigate the dossier's author, former British spy Christopher Steele, for possibly lying to the FBI. It is a crime to lie to FBI agents about a material fact relevant to an ongoing investigation. The letter says Steele may have lied to the FBI \\"regarding his distribution of information contained in the dossier.\\" In response to a lawsuit filed in London, Steele has said he had off-the-record conversations with a handful of news organizations during that period, including The Washington Post. It was not immediately clear how conversations with reporters might be materially relevant to the investigation the FBI was conducting. The move by Grassley and Graham was viewed skeptically by some Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, as well as experts in criminal law. Steele's role has become a matter of increasingly heated debate, with the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill suggesting his reports were biased, since he was hired with money that ultimately came from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. [Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research leading to Trump dossier] Steele's allegations — in addition to other information, including intelligence intercepts and an Australian diplomat's account of a conversation with a Trump adviser in a London wine bar — prompted the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into Trump associates in July 2016, according to current and former officials. The Australian warning was first reported by the New York Times. That investigation has since expanded into a special-counsel probe by Robert S. Mueller III, whose work has led to indictments of two former Trump campaign officials, as well as guilty pleas and cooperation deals from two others. As the Russia probe has heated up, some Republicans have amplified their attacks on Steele's dossier, contending it was a weapon in a political smear campaign they claim was aided by the FBI. Steele did not respond to a request for comment. But a lawyer for the consulting firm that hired him, Fusion GPS, had a strong reaction. \\"After a year of investigations into Donald Trump's ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place,\\" the lawyer, Joshua A. Levy, said in a statement. \\"Publicizing a criminal referral based on classified information raises serious questions about whether this letter is nothing more than another attempt to discredit government sources, in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation. We should all be skeptical in the extreme.\\" A veteran prosecutor, Peter Zeidenberg, said he had never heard of anything like the Grassley-Graham complaint and labeled it \\"nonsense\\" designed to detract from ongoing inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \\"The FBI doesn't need any prompting from politicians to prosecute people who have lied to them,\\" said Zeidenberg, a federal prosecutor for 17 years. While members of Congress make criminal referrals from time to time, they are usually related to independent congressional investigations, not to material already known to the FBI. \\"They should stay in their lane,\\" Zeidenberg said of the Grassley-Graham effort. Another former federal prosecutor, Justin Dillon, said it was too early to assume the letter was simply a political attack. \\"Given that we don't know what the basis for the referral is, it seems premature to simply assume it was partisan,\\" Dillon said. \\"I do find it hard to believe that Grassley and Graham would just make this up out of whole cloth.\\" Grassley said in a statement Friday, \\"If we see what appears to be credible evidence of a violation that should be further investigated based on information from any source, public or non-public, we are going to formally notify the department.\\" The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), said she and other Democrats had not been consulted about the request for a criminal inquiry. \\"This referral is unfortunate,\\" Feinstein said in a statement. \\"It's clearly another effort to deflect attention from what should be the committee's top priority: determining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election and whether there was subsequent obstruction of justice.\\" One Republican aide familiar with Judiciary Committee operations said: \\"It's pretty clear that Grassley and Graham are interested in carrying water for the White House, but that is not reflective of the whole committee. There are members of Judiciary who are upset with Senator Grassley for carrying it so close to the vest.\\" The aide asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Steele was a senior intelligence officer monitoring the Kremlin for Britain's intelligence service, MI6, before he left the agency and established a consulting firm, Orbis. In that role, he worked for a range of clients, including law firms and Fusion GPS. The dossier is a compilation of reports he wrote for Fusion GPS between June and late October 2016, plus a final report in December, after the election. Among other things, the dossier alleged that the Russian government collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an effort to assist his campaign for president. U.S. intelligence agencies later released a public assessment asserting that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to aid Trump. The FBI has been investigating whether Trump associates helped the Russians in that effort. Trump has vigorously denied the allegations in the dossier and has called the FBI probe a witch hunt. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham have recommended that the FBI pursue a criminal investigation against Christopher Steele, the author of the disputed Trump-Russia dossier, for possible false statements made to federal investigators. In a joint statement, the senators did not provide public evidence for their request but sent a \\"classified memorandum\\" to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The request does not assess the validity of the dossier itself and only constitutes a referral for further investigation. Democrats have responded in anger, with some calling it an attempt to deflect attention from the main issue of whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 elections."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's..., what would be the answer ?

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the church next to the Old Supreme Court building, the latter of which was also designed by Greenway? , can you please find it? One of Greenway's finest works, St James' is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning.

The answer is:","completion":"Mary Harris Jones, commonly known as Mother Jones, was a prominent labor organizer and social activist during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born in 1837 in County Cork, Ireland, she migrated to North America and eventually became a U.S. citizen. Over the course of her life, she accomplished a great deal in advocating for workers' rights, including improved working conditions, wages, and child labor laws. Some of her most notable accomplishments include: 1. Formation of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA): As a tireless advocate for miners' rights, Mother Jones was instrumental in the establishment of the UMWA in 1890. The union played a critical role in improving wages, working conditions, and general welfare for miners throughout the United States. 2. Role in the Colorado Coalfield War: In the early 20th century, Mother Jones became deeply involved in the struggle for miners' rights in the coalfields of southern Colorado. Known as the Colorado Coalfield War, or the Ludlow Massacre, the conflict arose due to unfair labor practices and substandard working conditions in mines owned by the Rockefeller family. Mother Jones actively participated in the organization of strikes and provided invaluable support and encouragement to the striking miners. 3. Advocacy for child labor laws: Recognizing the plight of young children working in dangerous and unhealthy conditions, Mother Jones passionately campaigned against the rampant practice of child labor. In 1903, she organized and led a highly-publicized march from Philadelphia to New York City, the \\"Children's Crusade\\", to draw attention to the issue and to push for legislation banning child labor. Her efforts helped lay the groundwork for the eventual enactment of child labor laws across the country. 4. Mass organization of workers: Mother Jones organized countless strikes, protests, and other activities to support various labor movements, earning her the title \\"the most dangerous woman in America\\" by a U.S. district attorney. One such achievement was her involvement in the 1912 Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike in West Virginia, where she effectively organized what became one of the most protracted armed conflicts in the nation's labor history. 5. The foundation of the Social Democratic Party: As a vocal proponent of socialism during a time when it was largely frowned upon, Mother Jones joined Eugene V. Debs and Victor Berger in launching the Social Democratic Party of America in 1898. Although the party did not gain significant power, it played an essential role in promoting social and labor reforms as well as providing an alternative political voice to workers. 6. Induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame: In recognition of her tireless work advocating for social and labor reforms, Mother Jones was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1984, signifying the lasting impact of her efforts on U.S. society. In conclusion, Mary Harris Jones, known as Mother Jones, accomplished a great deal throughout her life as a labor organizer and social activist. Her relentless pursuit of workers' rights, fair wages, and better working conditions not only led to crucial reforms in her time but also laid the groundwork for future advancements in labor laws and workers' protections. Mother Jones' unwavering spirit and fierce commitment to social and economic justice continue to inspire generations of activists today."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Paragraph: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries? Answer:","completion":"Given the paragraph, the fruit that Mary candied and are therefore saturated with sugar are apricots.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Options: - speak freely - school child - understand children - care for children - toddler Explain why a human would choose \\"school child\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"Human beings would most likely choose \\"school child\\" as the answer to the question for several reasons. To clarify, five years after becoming a parent, it is common for a child to be around the age of five. This age usually marks the beginning of primary education in many countries, a time when the child transitions from being a toddler or preschooler to entering formal schooling. Here are some reasons why a human would choose \\"school child\\" to answer the question above: 1. Age of the child: After five years of becoming a parent, the child would typically be around five years old. This is the age most children start their primary education, as they are more capable of managing school routines, following instructions, and engaging in a variety of learning activities. 2. Developmental milestones: By five years old, children have achieved several developmental milestones that prepare them for entering school. For instance, they have developed essential motor skills, such as holding a pencil and controlling their movements; cognitive skills, like understanding basic math and problem-solving concepts; and language skills, which enable them to converse clearly and understand others. 3. Socialization: At the age of five, children have enhanced their socialization skills by interacting with peers through playgroups, excursions, or preschool settings. They begin to understand the concept of sharing, taking turns, and managing emotions, which are essential skills for navigating relationships with other children and teachers in school. 4. Behavioral and emotional readiness: School-aged children should have learned essential self-regulatory skills to manage their emotions, behaviors, and thoughts. As they enter school, they need to adapt to new demands and routines and cope adequately with stress and frustration. These skills are crucial for succeeding in a school environment. 5. Legal requirements: In several countries, attending school is mandatory from the age of 5 or 6, depending on the jurisdiction. Parents are legally obligated to enroll their children in primary education to ensure they receive the necessary knowledge and social experiences to foster healthy development. In conclusion, the answer \\"school child\\" appropriately represents the most relevant option for the given question because, after becoming parents for five years, people will mostly have a child around five years old who is transitioning into or attending primary school. This stage includes essential developmental, social, emotional, and even legal aspects that define the school child category."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - retail markup - revenue - income - for free - benefit Explain why a human would choose \\"for free\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"for free\\" to answer the question \\"If you get something for no cost you get that thing what?\\" because it best represents the meaning and implication of receiving something without paying any price for it. Among the options provided, \\"for free\\" is the most accurate and suitable answer. Let's briefly analyze each option to clarify why choosing \\"for free\\" makes the most sense in this context. 1. Retail markup: This term refers to the difference between the cost of a product to a retailer and the price at which they sell it to the end consumer. While it is related to pricing, it does not address the idea of getting something at no cost. Thus, it is not the appropriate answer. 2. Revenue: Revenue is the total income generated from the sale of goods or services by a business. It considers all transactions that involve an exchange of money, which does not align with the notion of receiving something at no cost. Therefore, it is not the suitable answer to the question. 3. Income: Income generally refers to the money received by an individual or business over a specified period, usually earned through work or investments. It also implies financial gain and is not directly related to acquiring something for no cost. Thus, it does not fit the context of the question. 4. For free: This option clearly reflects the idea of getting something without any payment or monetary exchange. It directly expresses the concept of receiving something for no cost, making it the most accurate and appropriate answer to the question. 5. Benefit: A benefit is an advantage or profit gained from something. Although receiving something for no cost could be considered advantageous, the term 'benefit' does not explicitly convey the idea of no-cost acquisition. Thus, it is not the most precise answer to the question. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"for free\\" to answer the question because it distinctly conveys the concept of receiving something without bearing any cost or financial obligation. This option is the most accurate and directly related to the notion of getting something at no cost, making it the most suitable answer among the choices provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Louis van Gaal and Roy Hodgson are coach/manager and not players, thus they cannot be a captain of a team. 3. The sentence is talking about the impossibility of Hodgson not choosing Rooney, so Rooney himself isn't a correct option. 4. Steven Gerrard is excluded as he is the person Wayne Rooney would be replacing, as mentioned in the text.

That is still a big hurdle for TLP, which wants five other lagoons on the west UK coast to harness power, and needs a guaranteed price for it. There are also concerns about the impact on the environment and migratory fish. The backing by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is seen as a significant step forward for the developers. Energy Minister Lord Bourne, who is also Wales Office Minister, said: \\"We need more clean and home-grown sources of energy, which will help to reduce our reliance on foreign fossil fuels. \\"Low carbon energy projects like the tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay could bring investment, support local jobs and help contribute to the Welsh economy and Swansea area.\\" The tidal lagoon on the eastern side of Swansea Bay, between the docks and the new university campus, would use the flow and ebb of the tide to generate energy, which would then be converted into electricity. But before the lagoon becomes a reality, there are three main challenges that need to be met: The attraction for the UK Government is the potential for a new industry. Thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs could be created, especially if five much bigger lagoons are built in the Severn estuary and off the north Wales coast. There would also be a boost to the UK's standing as a generator of clean, green energy. Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Gloucester-based TLP, said the project had the\\" potential to help transform our industrial economy and the UK's energy mix\\". He added: \\"We see it as a game-changer, a scalable blueprint, paving the way for a fleet of lagoons that can work in harmony with nature to help secure the nation's electricity for generations to come.\\" Swansea council leader Rob Stewart called the news hugely encouraging for the city, saying it would boost leisure and tourism. Friends of the Earth Cymru director Gareth Clubb also welcomed the news, adding: \\"Tidal power could further revolutionise Wales' energy mix - instead of relying on climate-wrecking fossil fuels, it could help us build a clean and safer energy future.\\" However he called for the government to make the most of existing renewable resources such as offshore wind and solar power. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) will continue to assess the possible effects of the lagoon on the environment. A marine licence could be issued by the end of July. If the decision is a positive one, work would start next March. A Welsh government spokesman said: \\"We welcome this decision. Wales is well-placed to exploit the potential of marine energy and the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project could create thousands of jobs during the construction and hundreds of permanent ones.\\" ANALYSIS by Iolo ap Dafydd, BBC Wales environment correspondent Tidal energy has political muscle from both George Osborne and David Cameron behind it, while the developers claim the promised tourism and jobs from the project have strong support in the Swansea area. But there are challenges too. Big ones. There are environmental concerns about the impact on migratory fish. The Swansea lagoon would be between the Tawe and Neath estuaries. The potentially larger lagoon in eastern Cardiff could block the Rhymney estuary. TLP still needs a marine licence from NRW whatever is decided in Westminster. The impact of dredging and clearing on the bay, as well as sediment pollution, are other considerations. And the project could yet face legal challenges or calls for a judicial review. Then there's the cost. A cool billion pounds for an energy output that would be a third of an average sized power station. TLP and the UK Government now need to agree a guaranteed price for the energy generated. Last year, the company asked for £168 per MWhe - higher than for nuclear, solar and onshore wind energy - but will not say the current detail of negotiations. Higher tariffs are offered to wave and other marine technologies, but unlike energy lagoons, they are far in the future whereas staff at TLP want to be able to start building next spring.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: In March 1992, a conveyor belt broke at the McDonald’s in Sydney River, Nova Scotia. Two months later, three people were dead and another forever disabled because of it. The conveyor belt was at the back of the restaurant and it carried buns, all-beef patties, fries and secret sauces from the kitchen to a storage area in the basement. When it broke, one of the fast-food joint’s newest employees, Derek Wood, 18, was sent downstairs to open a seldom-used door that led into the basement so the supplies could be carried in. In that dismal, dark room, a light bulb flashed in Wood’s head, wrote journalist Phonse Jessome in his book on the case, “Murder at McDonald’s.” Wood, a young man with bleak prospects, saw a chance to get rich quick. He told two buddies, Darren Muise, 18, and Freeman MacNeil, 23, that there was a safe in an upstairs office that had held at least 200,000. The general outline of the plan was that Wood would prop the door open with his knapsack and sneak up to the safe and open it quickly, even though he wasn’t entirely sure of all the numbers in the combination. Muise would go into the kitchen to keep the employees under control. MacNeil would drive the getaway car. They planned it carefully, down to figuring out how to change clothes after the job so that there would be no fiber evidence left behind and no telltale ketchup smears on what they were wearing. Muise, who would come face-to-face with the kitchen workers, chose a disguise a rubber Halloween mask that turned the dark-haired youth into a white-haired, disfigured, old man. They brought along one other thing a silver .22 pistol. It all might have come off fine if Arlene MacNeil, 20, had been less conscientious. Around midnight on May 7, she had finished her shift and decided to wait for her friend, night manager Donna Warren, 22, so they could leave together. To pass the time, MacNeil, no relation to the third man in the plot, went into the basement storeroom to sort novelties in preparation for a children’s party scheduled for the next day. When MacNeil saw Wood and the man in the old-man mask, she asked if this was a joke. There was no answer, just a shot that put a bullet in her head. Another man, maintenance worker Neil Burroughs, 29, a married man with a child, was cleaning up in the kitchen when Muise shot him, as well. The bullet didn’t kill him, so Muise tried to slit his throat with a hunting knife. He somehow couldn’t hit the jugular vein. When Burroughs refused to die, MacNeil jumped in and finished him off with a blow to the head with a shovel. While MacNeil and Muise were trying to kill Burroughs, Wood hauled Warren into the office and ordered her to open the safe. She complied and was rewarded with two bullets in her head. Next to die was another night-shift worker, Jimmy Fagan, 27, who stumbled upon the trio as they were about to flee, cash box in hand. Fagan had taken a cab to work that night and as the cabbie drove away, he heard a popping sound and noticed three figures running away from the building toward a field. He turned and saw his passenger on the ground, and, on his dispatcher’s orders, did not stop. The dispatcher called police but by the time they arrived, the killers had reached their getaway car. “I finally got to slit someone’s throat,” Muise said, as the three killers zoomed off. They didn’t realize that they had left something behind-Wood’s knapsack, with his name on it, that he had used to prop open the back door. They were in for another shock when they broke open the cash box and discovered that the take for the night’s mayhem and death was 2,017.27. By May 16, there were arrests and confessions to the four shootings, but only three charges of murder. Although shot in the head, MacNeil would survive, permanently disabled. Wood and MacNeil were found guilty and given life sentences with no chance of parole for 25 years. Derek Wood applied for day parole as soon as he was eligible, 22 years after the crime, but was denied, at least in part because of his assaults on two prison guards in 2007. Muise, who pleaded guilty to robbery and second-degree murder, got a life sentence with no chance of parole for 20 years. In 2012, he was granted a full parole, the decision based on “compliant behavior” and years of prison anger-management programs. There have been some reports that he inherited money and invested it well, and is living a quiet, comfortable life. The idea of this rankles the families left behind. Cathy Burroughs, the sister of one of the victims, said that her family had been sentenced to a lifetime of misery and that she could never forgive her brother’s murderers. She vowed revenge. “Oh, I wouldn’t kill him, but I’m going to toy with him. What’s the system going to do,” she told the Nova Scotia Chronicle Herald. “Put me in jail? Big deal, compared with what they did to my family, the Warren family and the MacNeils and Fagans.” Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"The Deadly Heist: How a Broken Conveyor Belt at McDonald's Led to Tragedy and Murder in Nova Scotia\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context: Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to...

As I drew closer ,I saw my mother lying on the ground. In the hospital, it was hard to believe that the lady who lay before me was my mom. My mother could not remember my name. As the leaves changed colors, it became clear that the stroke had created a wall between my mother's mind and mouth: her mind was not any less clear, but the words she spoke were not what she meant. The battle my mother faced taught me the importance of language. Without it, identity does not exist; relationships cannot be formed; stories cannot be told; directions cannot be given, and knowing any-thing about anyone is impossible. Without language, communication cannot take place. Without language, one cannot express the beauty of a sunset or the kindness of a stranger. The world would pass us by in silence.

A government-sponsored coup last year made Bruce Iwasaki and Neal Dudovitz the kings of Los Angeles County's federally funded legal aid community. The two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doled out by an unsympathetic GOP-controlled Congress. That era was capped in 1998, when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179. To comply with the orders from their main funding source, a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free phone lines, self-help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice. While some organizations made the dramatic change look effortless, for others, it did not come easy. And few programs provide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government-funded legal services than Los Angeles County's two largest providers of federally funded services - Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Pacoima-based Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County. From his offices in Koreatown, Iwasaki, a soft-spoken former O'Melveny & Myers attorney, quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. The merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal order. Today, the programs operate seamlessly, offering new innovations - including toll-free multilingual phone advisers, expanded hours for domestic-violence clinics, and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program. The organization is Los Angeles' largest government-funded group, with a budget of 11 million leveraged into 40 million in legal services to the poor.

After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family. Gradually, however, he begins to settle in. Karni finally tracks Hans down and tries to take him into custody. Hans panics again and barricades himself in Ya'el's room with her rifle, but Ya'el and Karni get him to admit he needs help and to give himself up. Answer:","completion":"In the article, Hans Müller believed that his fame and popularity would prevent tragedy from befalling him and his family during the Nazi regime in Germany. Despite warnings from friends to flee the country, Hans made the grave mistake of thinking that his renown as a professional juggler would be enough to protect him and his loved ones from the risks and dangers posed by the oppressive regime. Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, Hans's misplaced trust in his fame led to devastating consequences, which resulted in the murder of his family. His inability to prevent this tragedy led to the development of psychological problems, including survivor's guilt. In summary, Hans Müller thought that his fame and popularity as a professional juggler would act as a shield against the tragedy that eventually struck his family during the Nazi era in Germany. Unfortunately, this erroneous belief contributed to the hardships he faced later on, as well as the significant emotional burden he carried."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Hercules Movie plot: In Ancient Greece in the land far away, when people read Greek mythology came the time of legend â the greatest son of Zeus â Hercules. Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him. A series of labors are shown like the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, catching the stag of Artemis, the Cathmanian boar, the Cretan bull, cleaning the Augeean stables, getting the girdle of Hippolyte, the man-eating mares of Diomedes and the Cattle of Geryon (but the monster is not shown). When asked to get the Golden Apples of the Hesperides, he does not get permission so he goes to Atlas who gets the apples for him.

What compels a Speaker of the House, as he's (supposed to be) trying to reach a deal to preserve various expiring government goodies before Congress recesses for the year, to move a resolution that would \\"commission the placement of a bust of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the Capitol\\"? Here he is, talking about it, softly crying, of course, but not in full Boehner Bawl mode. Winston Churchill, he was one helluva a guy. Anyway, this is all about race. The reason Boehner and Co. are doing this is not merely because they admire Winston Churchill's speech before Congress 70 years ago. It's more the climax of a nearly three-year right-wing crusade against Barack Obama, whom they believe got rid of a White House bust of Winston Churchill upon assuming office in a fit of uppity anti-colonial rage. It all goes back to this Telegraph article from February 2009, which your creepy survivalist uncle almost certainly has bookmarked: A bust of the former prime minister once voted the greatest Briton in history, which was loaned to George W Bush from the Government's art collection after the September 11 attacks, has now been formally handed back. The bronze by Sir Jacob Epstein, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds if it were ever sold on the open market, enjoyed pride of place in the Oval Office during President Bush's tenure. But when British officials offered to let Mr Obama to hang onto the bust for a further four years, the White House said: \\"Thanks, but no thanks.\\" [...] Churchill has less happy connotations for Mr Obama than those American politicians who celebrate his wartime leadership. It was during Churchill's second premiership that Britain suppressed Kenya's Mau Mau rebellion. Among Kenyans allegedly tortured by the colonial regime included one Hussein Onyango Obama, the President's grandfather. A White House spokesperson, though, had a less hysterical account, noting that \\"the Churchill bust was removed before Obama's inauguration as part of the usual changeover operations, adding that every president puts his own stamp on the Oval Office.\\" But the legend of Obama angrily tossing out Sir Winston as his first act of revenge against whitey's colonial crimes has persisted, and it's finally slinked its way into a resolution on the House floor. Now we'll have to move on to, say, the resolution demanding Obama stop putting his filthy feet on Queen Victoria's desk. Anything that reminds him that he is a guest in this office, in more ways than most. ||||| While House Republicans couldn’t get their act together to approve an extension of the payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits last night, they were able to do something far more frivolousness — commission a bust of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to be placed in the Capitol. The House “adjourned moments after” passing the bill, which directs: That the Architect of the Capitol place an appropriate statue or bust of Sir Winston Churchill in the United States Capitol at a location directed by the House Fine Arts Board in consultation with the Speaker. The resolution was seen as a rebuke to the White House, which returned a bust of Churchill to the British Embassy in 2009. House Speaker John Bohener (R-OH) shocked Washington Sunday when he said his caucus would reject the Senate’s compromise on the payroll tax package, even though it passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 89-10. The House planned to reject the Senate bill last night, but postponed the vote after it became clear that some Republicans were going to agree with the Senate. Now, a 1,000 tax break for 160 million Americans hangs in the balance. The Churchill bill was approved via unanimous consent, meaning the House didn’t have to waste much time considering it, but it underscores the absurdity of Boehner’s gaming of the payroll tax holiday vote. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the strange decision by the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, to move a resolution to commission a bust of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to be placed in the Capitol building.

Write a summary based on this article: Albert Einstein's corpus callosum, the bundle of fibers that connects the brain's two hemispheres and facilitates inter-hemispheric communication, was unusually well-connected, according to a new study published in the journal Brain, which suggests that Einstein's high level of cranial connectivity may have contributed to his brilliance. Florida State University evolutionary anthropologist Dean Falk participated in the study led by Weiwei Men of East China Normal University. Falk said this study, more so than any other to date, \\"really gets 'inside' Einstein's brain.\\" After his death in 1955, Einstein's brain was preserved, although the fact remained hidden until 1986. The researchers used a new technique for measuring brain connectivity developed by Men. \\"Men's technique measures and color-codes the varying thicknesses of subdivisions of the corpus callosum along its length, where nerves cross from one side of the brain to the other,\\" said a Florida State University statement. \\"These thicknesses indicate the number of nerves that cross and therefore how 'connected' the two sides of the brain are in particular regions, which facilitate different functions depending on where the fibers cross along the length. For example, movement of the hands is represented toward the front and mental arithmetic along the back.\\" Men's research on Einstein's brain connectivity was done by photographs of Einstein's brain published by Falk and others in 2012. To make comparisons of Einstein's brain's connectivity versus that of others, the researchers used samples taken from a group of elderly men and a larger group of men who were 26 years old. In 1905, when Einstein was 26, he had his so-called \\"miracle year\\" where he published four papers that significantly contributed to the foundation of modern physics. Compared to both the younger and older control groups, Falk and Men found that Einstein's brain had more extensive connections between certain parts of the cerebral hemisphere. \\"This technique should be of interest to other researchers who study the brain's all-important internal connectivity,\\" Falk said. ||||| Einstein’s Genius Likely A Result Of His Well-Connected Brain by editor [ Watch the Video: Dissecting Einstein's Brain ] redOrbit Staff & Wire Reports - Your Universe Online Albert Einstein is generally recognized as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century, but exactly what was it that made his brain so special? The authors of a recently published study believe that they have found the answer to that riddle. Writing in the journal Brain, Weiwei Men of East China Normal University's Department of Physics and his colleagues explained that the left and right hemispheres of the German-born theoretical physicist’s brain were exceptionally well connected to one another. That connection could have played a vital role in his intelligence. “This study, more than any other to date, really gets at the 'inside' of Einstein's brain. It provides new information that helps make sense of what is known about the surface of Einstein's brain,” Florida State University (FSU) evolutionary anthropologist Dr. Dean Falk explained in a statement. The study authors developed a new technique to conduct their research, which they claim is the first to analyze Einstein's corpus callosum (the largest bundle of fibers in the brain, and the part of the brain that that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication) in detail. Dr. Falk said that their method “should be of interest to other researchers who study the brain's all-important internal connectivity.” According to FSU, the technique developed by Men’s team “measures and color-codes the varying thicknesses of subdivisions of the corpus callosum along its length, where nerves cross from one side of the brain to the other. These thicknesses indicate the number of nerves that cross and therefore how ‘connected’ the two sides of the brain are in particular regions, which facilitate different functions depending on where the fibers cross along the length.” This technique allowed the study authors to register and compare the measurements of Einstein’s brain with those of two existing samples, one belonging to 15 elderly men and the other from 52 men who were Einstein’s age in 1905. During that year, the then-26-year-old physicist published four articles that would be essential to the foundations of modern physics, and helped alter the scientific community’s views of space, time, mass and energy. Men started work analyzing Einstein's corpus callosum by requesting high-resolution photographs of the two halves of the genius’s brain that had been published by Falk and other researchers in 2012. Their findings demonstrate that the man behind the general theory of relativity had more extensive connections between specific regions of his cerebral hemispheres than either the younger or older control groups. In addition to Men and Falk, who served as second author of the paper, Tao Sun of the Washington University School of Medicine and Weibo Chen, Jianqi Li, Dazhi Yin, Lili Zang and Mingxia Fan from the East China Normal University's Department of Physics were among the members of the research team. In March 2012, sections from Einstein’s brain were displayed alongside gray matter from other prominent historical figures at an exhibition in London. As the legendary thinker had requested, his brain was divided into several sections upon his death in 1955. The portions featured during the Wellcome Collection show “Brains: The Mind As Matter” had originally been put on display to the public in a Philadelphia museum back in 2011. ||||| Einstein was undoubtedly one of the most influential physicists of all time, advancing concepts in quantum physics and gaining enormous notoriety for his theory of relativity. Einstein was also a keen philosopher, proclaiming that “… independence by philosophical insight is… the mark of distinction between mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker of truth.“ It comes as no surprise that Einstein’s brain appears physiologically distinct from that of the average individual. A recent study has sought to explain the man’s genius-level intellect, in part, based a difference in a structure called the corpus callosum. Einstein’s Autopsied Brain Many have attempted to understand what inspired the German-born prodigy. A pathologist, named Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey, working at Princeton University, even attempted to establish whether there was a physiological trait that could explain the inner workings of Einstein’s extraordinary mind. Einstein died from internal bleeding, following a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. In 1955, Harvey, who was responsible for conducting Einstein’s autopsy, removed his subject’s brain, without requesting the permission of his family. Harvey then preserved Einstein’s brain in formalin, before snapping a vast number of photographs. After documenting the details of the specimen, he carved it up into approximately 240 individual sections, with the principal ambition of allowing the scientific community to research what made Einstein so truly remarkable. Harvey retained his photographs to write a book, which he was never able to finish. Following Harvey’s demise, his family decided to donate the images to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, during 2010. Decades after Einstein’s departure, it seems scientists are finally able to figure out the mysteries of the great man’s brain. The Corpus Callosum Study The latest research study, entitled The Corpus Callosum of Albert Einstein’s Brain: Another Clue to His High Intelligence, was published in the research journal Brain. The study demonstrated that the association between the left and right hemispheres of Einstein’s brain were atypical, with enhanced connection between these two parts. Evolutionary Anthropologist, Dean Falk, of Florida State University, collaborated on the project. Falk explains how the study offers greater insight into the illustrious physicist’s brain, improving upon prior research studies. The part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is known as the corpus callosum (A.K.A. the colossal commissure), a bundle of neuronal fibers that sits beneath the cerebral cortex, uniting the two hemispheres in the brains of higher order mammals. The study, which was led by Weiwei Men of East China Normal University, managed to establish a novel technique to explore the “internal connectivity” of Einstein’s corpus callosum, for the very first time. Using their new method, the team were able to determine the relative thickness of various subdivisions throughout length of the corpus callosum. These differences in thickness were then color-coded to provide the research group with an approximation for the number of neurons stretching between the left and rights hemispheres; a thicker corpus callosum suggests there to be a greater number of neurons. In addition, different regions of the corpus callosum are implicated in specialist functions. For example, neurons situated at the front of this interlinking region of the brain are involved in movement of hands, whilst neurons running along its posterior are thought to be implicated in mental arithmetic. The researchers applied their technique to compare Einstein’s corpus callosum to two sample groups, including one group of over a dozen elderly men, and another group of 52 men that were Einstein’s age in 1905. 1905 was a pivotal year in Albert Einstein’s life, publishing seminal articles on Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, as well as work that yielded the renowned E = mc2 formula. Following their study, the researchers concluded that Einstein’s brain demonstrated more extensive connections at particular points along the corpus callosum. The team suggest this could, at least partially, explain some of Einstein’s supreme intellectual abilities. Other Studies Falk and his colleagues had investigated Einstein’s brain on a previous occasion, in 2012. Simply through analysis of Harvey’s autopsy photographs, the team were able to visibly identify features of Einstein’s brain that could be fundamental to the man’s intellect. They found greater intricacy and convolution patterns across certain regions of his brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex, the visual cortex and the parietal lobes. The prefrontal cortex is critical to abstract thinking, decision-making and expression of personality traits, whilst the parietal lobe is involved in sense and motor function. Intriguingly, Falk’s group found that the somatosensory cortex, which receives sensory input information, was also increased in magnitude in an area that corresponded to his left hand. As Einstein was an avid violinist, after having been inspired by a number of Mozart’s pieces at age 13, the group drew a correlation between this enlarged cortical region and his musical aptitude. According to Live Science, Sandra Witelson, a scientist based at McMaster University, who has performed prior studies into Einstein’s brain, explained the physiological difference in the physicist’s neural tissue: “It’s not just that it’s bigger or smaller, it’s that the actual pattern is different… His anatomy is unique compared to every other photograph or drawing of a human brain that has ever been recorded.” Marion C. Diamond and colleagues, working at the University of California, published an article in 1985, called on the brain of a scientist: Albert Einstein. Fascinatingly, after performing microscopic cell counts, they found Einstein had an exceedingly high ratio of glial cells (a non-neuronal support cell) to regular neuronal cells, in two parts of his brain. It seems that Albert Einstein’s thicker corpus callosum may have been partly responsible for his genius-level intellect. However, it is likely that a combination of physiological factors played a part shaping the enigmatic theoretical physicist. The question is, will there ever be another extraordinary mind like Einstein’s?

It turns out, the part of his brain that connects the left side and the right side, called the corpus callosum, was very well-connected. This special connection might be one of the reasons Einstein was super smart. Scientists studied Einstein's brain by looking at pictures and comparing his brain to other people's brains. What they found was that Einstein's brain had more connections in some areas than other people's brains. This might help explain why he was so good at understanding things and coming up with new ideas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - Cloud Cult is an experimental indie rock band from Duluth, Minnesota led by singer/songwriter Craig Minowa. The name originated from the ancient prophecies of indigenous North Americans. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Feel Good Ghosts is an album by Cloud Cult released on Tuesday , April 8 2008 . - Craig Minowa is the singer/songwriter/frontman for the alternative rock band, Cloud Cult. He is also the founder of Earthology Records. Minowa was born Craig Richardson in February 1973. Minowa grew up in Owatonna, Minnesota. He is the middle child. He has two sisters, one older, Melanie, and one younger, Janelle. His father is an accountant and his mother is a nurse. All three siblings are very artistic. Minowa has a large tattoo of a tree on his calf that he designed himself. Craig worked in Duluth at the local co-op for a number of years before being prompted to pursue his musical career by a co-worker. Minowa met his wife, Connie Staska, when his younger sister brought Connie home after school one day. The two adopted the last name \\"Minowa\\" when they married in 1998.

Although the two sentences might seem similar, they present slightly different information, causing confusion about the subjects and their relationships. The first sentence states that \\"A second son of Berkeley John Talbot Levett and his wife Lady Jane was Theophilus Levett, an officer at the Scots Guards,\\" which implies that Theophilus Levett is the second son of a man named Berkeley John Talbot Levett and his wife, Lady Jane. Theophilus Levett, in turn, is an officer in the Scots Guards. The second sentence says that \\"A second son of Theophilus Levett and his wife Lady Jane was Berkeley John Talbot Levett, an officer in the Scots Guards.\\" In this case, the sentence purports that Berkeley John Talbot Levett is the second son of Theophilus Levett and his wife, Lady Jane, and that it is Berkeley (not Theophilus) who serves as an officer in the Scots Guards. Although both sentences have similarities and revolve around the subjects of Theophilus Levett, Berkeley John Talbot Levett, and their relationship to the Scots Guards, they provide different details and slightly alter the family connections.

In addition to conducting and music directing the original productions of several of the most famous Gilbert and Sullivan works and writing the overtures to some of them, Cellier conducted at many theatres in London, New York and on tour in Britain, America and Australia. He composed over a dozen operas and other works for the theatre, as well as for orchestra, but his 1886 comic opera, Dorothy, was by far his most successful work. It became the longest-running piece of musical theatre in the nineteenth century. Context: In 1885, Cellier composed a song, \\"There once was a time, my darling\\", for a piece produced by George Edwardes, Little Jack Sheppard (1885). Meanwhile he had composed what would become his greatest success, the comic opera Dorothy, with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson. To create the score, Cellier repurposed some of his music from his 1876 failure, Nell Gwynne, which had, nevertheless, received praise for its music. Dorothy had been announced for production at the Royalty Theatre in 1884, but ultimately Edwardes mounted it at his Gaiety Theatre on 25 September 1886. Cellier was in Australia from February 1886 to February 1887, conducting The Mikado and other Gilbert and Sullivan operas for the J. C. Williamson organization and was absent from London during the productions of The Carp, at the Savoy, and Dorothy. Neither the music nor the libretto of Dorothy initially attracted critical praise. The Times wrote, \\"Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality.\\" Stephenson rewrote the lyrics of one of Cellier's old songs, \\"Old Dreams\\" as \\"Queen of My Heart\\"; this helped the work to find success after it transferred in December to the Prince of Wales Theatre. The following year H. J. Leslie took over the production from Edwardes and introduced new stars, including Marie Tempest. Dorothy became an even greater success at the box office and transferred in December 1888 to the Lyric Theatre, built using the profits from the production, where it ran into 1889. Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time, longer than even The Mikado, a fact that caused consternation to Cellier's friend Arthur Sullivan. Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece, and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights David Garrick and Aphra Behn, and to Oliver Goldsmith and even Shakespeare. Its success led to revivals of some of Cellier's earlier works. Cellier returned to Australia in 1888 to conduct Dorothy and made a final brief visit there for health reasons in early 1891, together with Stephenson. His last comic operas, Doris (1889, with Stephenson) and The Mountebanks (with Gilbert, produced in January 1892, a few days after the composer's death), were both modestly successful. Also after Cellier's death, Rutland Barrington used some of his music in his 1902 adaptation of Water Babies. Often in ill health throughout his life, Cellier was unable to finish The Mountebanks, and Ivan Caryll completed the score. Cellier owed much to the influence of Sullivan. He was a fertile melodist, and his writing exhibited elegance and refinement, although he was not able to infuse his music with humour in the way that Sullivan did. Cellier died at his home in Bloomsbury, London, at the age of 47. He was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. Question: Where there any other later pieces after that? Answer:","completion":"Yes, after Alfred Cellier's most successful comic opera Dorothy, he composed several other works. This included the comic operas Doris in 1889, which was collaborated with B. C. Stephenson, and The Mountebanks which was co-written with William Schwenck Gilbert and produced in January 1892, a few days after Cellier's death. Both these operas had modest success.

Court docs: Relative accused Toby Willis of child rape According to court documents obtained by FOX411, Toby Willis was charged Friday with child rape after a relative accused the reality star of sexual assault. The court documents reveal Willis has been ordered to stay away from his children and wife. Willis’ wife Brenda released a statement Wednesday following her husband’s arrest. \\"I was shocked and devastated by the revelation of events leading to Toby Willis’ arrest,\\" Brenda Willis' attorney said in a statement on her behalf. \\"As these are very trying times for the Willis family, I kindly ask all to respect our family’s privacy. As a mother of twelve, my first priority remains with my children and helping them through this traumatic event. \\"We are cancelling all appearances for the foreseeable future to focus on the children and their well-being. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We have, and will continue, to fully cooperate with law enforcement officials and ask that you direct all inquiries regarding Toby Willis’ case to the District Attorney’s office who have our complete support.\\" The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation charged the 46-year-old with one count of child rape after an investigation revealed a sexual encounter he allegedly had with a child in 2002. He was arrested in Greenville, Kentucky where he had travelled to avoid arrest. He appeared in court on Monday without an attorney and did not oppose extradition.

Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Several nail salons recently inspected without notice have been shut down due to wage violations and recovered more than 47,000 owed to employees. The Department of Labor's Wage and Workplace Standards Division recently investigated 25 nail salons in Connecticut after receiving numerous complaints from people working at nail salons and reading news coverage of \\"questionable health and employment practices at nail salons, according to the labor department. Of those, the labor department shut down 23 nail salons for wage violations. State Labor Commissioner Sharon M. Palmer said that the division got 47,350 back from the salons in wages owed to employees, mostly because of establishments that violated minimum wage laws. She said the division hopes to collect more money to give back to the employees. \\"An additional 79,000 in civil penalties was levied and collected for under reporting payroll and paying employees in cash and 21,300 for wage and hour violations,\\" according to the labor department. Officials from the labor department made unannounced visits to the salons on Aug. 3, issuing stop work orders for the following nail salons. Unannounced visits to the salons on August 3, 2015 resulted in Stop Work orders being placed on the following establishments: Exclusive Future Uncertain for State CHAMP Fleet • Hartford: La Nails, American Nails, Modern Nails, Pink Nails, Touch Nails • New Haven: Magic Nail and Spa, Fashion Nail and Spa, Outo Nails • Stamford: Fiji Nail Salon, Cozy Nail Salon, Classic Nails, Lux Nails, Ace Nails • Branford: Oasis Nails, Pretty Nail and Spa, Sera Nail Salon, Town Nails, Simply Nails • Westport/Darien/Southport: Posh Nail and Spa LLC (three locations), Queen Nail and Spa, Finger Nails At the nail salons shut down for violations, investigators learned many employees were paid with cash with no payroll records to trace it, they were paid below the minimum wage of 9.15 an hour and they weren't being paid for overtime, according to Gary Pechie, director of the Wage and Workplace Standards Division. The inspectors also took issue with the salons' worker's compensation coverage, reporting that they didn't have proper coverage. Many salon employer groups contacted the labor department after the investigation, so the division will give them educational materials about state laws that apply to those types of businesses. “The wage division places a high priority on outreach and education and we urge employers with questions about wage laws to contact the unit at 860-263-6790 or visit the agency website at www.ct.gov/dol and click on ‘wage and workplace standards’ for guidelines,” Pechie said. Any other employees who weren't paid the right amount of money or who haven't received payment are encouraged to download a complaint form from the website. ||||| Labor investigators conducted the state's first enforcement sweep of 25 nail salons this month, temporarily shutting down 23 businesses and ordering at least 62,000 in back wages to more than 50 women. The sweep, conducted by the state Department of Labor, was inspired by an investigation in the New York Times about exploitation of immigrant workers at nail salons in New York and its suburbs, including Connecticut. Of 25 nail salons in the sweep from Hartford to Stamford, most chosen at random, only two businesses were following wage and hour laws, state officials said. The others were paying workers under the table, avoiding Social Security and unemployment taxes. The workers, many of them Asian immigrants, were often paid less than minimum wage. At one salon, women were being paid 40 for a 10-hour work day, according to Gary Pechie, director of wage and workplace standards at the department. Although tips may have raised those women's wages higher than the 9.15 minimum, only restaurants and bars are allowed to pay servers below the minimum and let tips make up the rest. At the 25 salons, 119 employees were being paid under the table, but were paid at least minimum wage, Pechie said. He said the 62,000 figure in back wages could increase as the investigation continues. The New York Times reported in May that New York's state labor department had not investigated wages in the nail salon industry because it usually responds to complaints, and had not received any from workers, most of whom do not speak English. The Times interviewed more than 100 workers for its investigation, and found only one-quarter were earning at least the minimum wage. Pechie said Connecticut had not done any enforcement in nail salons until now, but had received complaints from two workers after they heard about the New York Times stories. He said he also received five emails that had been sent to the governor's office, asking how Connecticut would respond to the Times' investigation. Although the Times investigation quoted an immigrant from Ecuador who worked at a Connecticut salon, Pechie said the state's sweep only found Asian employees. He said they cooperated with the investigation, and the company heard no threats by management that the workers would be reported to immigration authorities for cooperating. He said such threats are common when the Department of Labor inspects construction sites. The state Department of Labor does not oversee whether employees have work visas. The department seeks to ensure that employers pay a fair wage that includes unemployment insurance and Social Security, when required. \\"They would have to be paid as any other employee,\\" Pechie said. \\"Nobody should exploit them because of their status.\\" Employees must supply green cards, work visas, Social Security cards or proof of citizenship to be on the books. However, since employers are not obligated to use the e-verify system, which checks out Social Security numbers, and federal immigration authorities do not inspect all documents involving new hires, the salons could continue to employ them even if the documents are faked. There are 395 Korean-American salon owners represented by the Nail and Spa Association of Connecticut. Moo Yong Lee, who is not a salon owner, but is active in Korean American advocacy and charitable efforts, is serving as a liaison between Pechie and the salon owners, as well as Chinese and Vietnamese salon owners, as they work to comply with employment law. Lee said Monday he was surprised that so many of the salon owners were paying their employees under the table, especially after the wide publicity from the New York Times stories — which were also published in Korean — and the enforcement actions that followed in New York and New Jersey. Lee said he warned friends who own salons to make sure they were following the law after the New York and New Jersey salons were hit. \\"You guys be ready,\\" he said he told them. \\"They're coming.\\" He said he was embarrassed by the results of the enforcement action, and he said the salon owners in the association asked him to tell government officials that they are \\"really deeply sorry for not following rules and regulations.\\" The 23 salon owners who were paying workers under the table will owe 130,000 in civil penalties, some just for avoiding payroll taxes and workers' compensation, and others for also failing to pay minimum wage or overtime. Pechie said none of the managers at the places that were raided gave the inspectors any pushback — but that several patrons did. He said the inspectors allowed manicures or pedicures in process to be completed before shutting down the businesses that were paying employees with cash. \\"Nobody walked out with just three fingernails,\\" he said. Lee coordinated a seminar with Pechie that will be held at the New Haven Korean Church in Hamden Aug. 26. About 150 salon owners, who are Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese, have committed to attending, \\"They've got to learn how to operate business properly,\\" Lee said. \\"Otherwise they shouldn't live here. Really.\\" He said salons may not make as much money after they begin paying payroll taxes and minimum wages. He said he will lobby the legislature to add manicurists to those eligible for the tipped minimum wage. Pechie said that even without a change in the law, owners have a way to recoup some of the additional costs of compliance. They could ask the workers to give managers their tips at the end of the day. Five salons in Hartford — LA Nails, American Nails, Modern Nails, Pink Nails and Touch Nails — were cited for not following labor laws and were temporarily shut down. The department also closed three salons in New Haven, five in Branford, five in Stamford, and five salons in the Westport-Darien-Fairfield area. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The Department of Labor recently checked 25 nail salons in Connecticut and found that 23 of them were not following the rules for paying their workers. These nail salons were closed down because they were not paying their employees enough money.

They also collected an extra 79,000 and 21,300 for other problems with the way the salons were paying their employees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Just like how we arrange our toys neatly so our room is tidy and comfortable, feng shui helps make sure that houses, buildings, and roads are put together in a way that everyone can enjoy.

An elderly man called dispatch saying that he had not eaten in two days. Officers quickly jumped into action. Officers Brian Gray, Nathan Bolton, Buddy Odom and Adam Runions went grocery shopping and bought enough food to fill the man's pantry for a month. The officers delivered the food to the man and even put the groceries in the cabinets for him. Copyright 2016 WAFF. All rights reserved. Report an Error | Submit a Tip to WAFF 48 ||||| MT. PLEASANT, Tenn. (WKRN) – A group of Mt. Pleasant police officers are being recognized for going out of their way to help an elderly man over the weekend. Saturday night, the 79-year-old disabled man called dispatchers and said he had not eaten in two days. A short time later, a group of officers showed up at his door with several bags full of groceries. The officers had spent 160 out of their own pockets to make sure the man had enough food in his kitchen to last him a month. “I think he was shocked at the amount of food that we bought and just the fact that it was there without question,” said Nathan Bolton. A picture of the officers stocking the man’s cabinets was posted on Facebook and the good deed has been shared by people across the country. “It’s difficult for us to see as police officers. We’re out here to take care of the public at large and that doesn’t always mean stopping a car. Sometimes it’s us doing little things like this,” said Mark Billions. The police officers have since been praised for going above and beyond the call of duty. The elderly man, who asked News 2 not to use his name, said he appreciates everything they did to help him. The man is on a fixed income and relies on his social security benefits each month. He said he didn’t have any money to buy food because a former caretaker stole his debit card last weekend. She was arrested by the Mt. Pleasant Police Department Sunday night and has been identified as Tammy Brooks, 36, of Mt. Pleasant. Police say they have surveillance video showing her using the stolen debit card at various retailers. She is charged with theft and fraudulent use of a debit card. She was booked in the Maury County Jail. Mt. Pleasant police have started a food pantry to help citizens in situations like these.

Two days later, he wrote again: \\"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \\"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\\". Consequently, he was baptised \\"Albert Frederick Arthur George\\" at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth.

Article: Parents do need to teach their kids financial responsibility and that money is earned. Still, many child-development experts agree that tying a child's allowance to chores can be a slippery slope. Here's why. Susie Walton, master instructor at Peace in Your Home advises to keep chores and allowances totally separate. \\"Allowance is one thing. When it comes to chores, life skills, responsibilities-that's a whole different thing.\\" says Walton. Walton says, \\"When kids aren't doing a chore, you don't say, 'well, there goes your allowance.' You're going to sit them down and ask what's going on. 'We are a team. We are a family. We've got to have them done.'\\" Besides, by paying children for chores with an allowance, you'll also be sending the message that work isn't worth doing unless they're getting paid for it. There are times when it would make sense to pay kids for chores. Most financial and child-development experts agree that it's a fine idea to pay children money for extra jobs that are outside their normal set of chores, such as washing windows, washing the car or helping to clean out the garage-especially if the child is saving for a big item. This may even develop an entrepreneurial spirit to think outside of the box to earn money. For parents who are concerned that their children won't learn the value of a dollar if the allowance isn't tied to household chores, note that there are still plenty of money management skills to be learned from a straight allowance. Depending on the age, kids can be made responsible for paying for their own toys or snacks. Some parents even require that kids set aside a percentage of their allowance toward savings. \\"I really like having my own money,\\" says Kevin, 9. \\"It's up to me if I want to buy the cheap toy now, or save and get the better toy.\\" And that's a good lesson to learn at 9 years old. No matter which allowance route you take in parenthood, kids will feel empowered by being able to handle their own money. Question: Which of the following would Susie Walton most probably agree with? Options: (A) A child's allowance shouldn't be tied to chores. (B) Kids shouldn't be forced to do chores. (C) Doing chores teaches kids the value of work. (D) Kids should be paid for doing chores.

He had to end his college studies because his health was poor. He began to travel, looking for a place that was good for his health. And he wrote about his travels. Inland Voyage(1878) was about journeys by canoe on the rivers and canals of Belgium and France. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes followed it in next year. People loved his travel books, and they also found his poems beautiful. In 1879 he travelled to California in a very uncomfortable ship and then by train across the United States to San Francisco. He married in California, but his poor health made him and his wife travel again. Readers of his travel books and poetry were surprised when Treasure Island came out in 1883. It was not at all like his earlier writing, but both children and grown-ups loved it. Treasure Island was finished in Switzerland. Stevenson then continued to travel. He loved the islands of the southern Pacific Ocean, and he found that his health was better there. In the end, he and his wife made their home in Samoa. It was there that he wrote Kidnapped(1886), the story of David Balfour and Alan Breck. It was followed (but not immediately) by Catriona, which continues the story of David Belfour and tells of other exciting adventures of David and Alan, and of David's love for Catriona Drummond. In between the two stories about David Belfour came another surprising book, the \\"thriller\\" called The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson died in Samoa in 1894, and he is buried there. Question: Stevenson settled in Samoa because _ .

PUBLISHED:. 05:31 EST, 6 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:22 EST, 6 June 2013. It brings a new meaning to the phrase ‘heavy police presence’. This substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is Britain’s fattest bobby. But colleagues were quick to defend Sergeant Andy Sharp, saying he is not even the largest officer in his force. Whatever the truth, he might struggle. to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on. the thin blue line are fighting fit. On the beat: Sergeant Andy Sharp marshalling campaigners at a march in central London. Frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take. The move follows fears that some. officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of. shape. Sgt Sharp, a long-serving Met officer who specialises in. organising high-profile events, was photographed marshalling crowds on. Sunday. He was seen with road cycling star Mark Cavendish at the Help. the Heroes charity bike ride from Blackheath to Central London. He was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through Whitehall to protest at NHS cuts. John Tully, of the Met Police. Federation, said Sgt Sharp spends most of his time on ‘desk duty’ but. comes out during the events he supervises. He said: ‘Everyone should be fit for. purpose. There is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes. officer safety training. Sgt Andy Sharp marshals protesters on a London NHS march last month. ‘Presumably he has been able to do that. Regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that.’ Police have been warned they could. face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards. set by new fitness tests. A major review by former rail. regulator Tom Winsor called for running tests and assault course-style. assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals. A survey found 52 per cent of male. officers and staff in the Met were overweight, 22 per cent were obese. and one per cent were morbidly obese. One senior officer told the review. some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot. complete the warm-up exercises’. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment. should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice. Rick Nelson, a Met officer and Federation representative who is helping design new fitness tests, said changes are being made. But he added: ‘In many cases, just. because officers are heavy it doesn’t mean they are unfit. And a very. fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job.’ 1. Running (known as the Multi-stage shuttle run test or Bleep Test)2. A test of strength (Dynamic Strength Test or Push-Pull)You should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test.(1) The multi-stage shuttle run test (Bleep Test)This is done first. You will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep. The speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark. The level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 (5.4). You will run 44 shuttles to reach this level.You are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient. (2) Dynamic Strength Test (Push-Pull)This test is carried out on a Concept 2 DYNO machine. After 3 warm up pushes, you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times. This is repeated with pulling instead of pushing. The mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded. The minimum level is 34 kg (push) and 35kg (pull). You are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine. PRE Scale – As you run rate the intensity on a scale of 6 to 20. Number 6 being very, very light and 20 being exhausting. Aim for an intensity of number 14 or 15, which should feel like a HARD run. If you feel you have exceeded number 15, then slow down as you could be running too fast. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Please answer a question about the following article about History of science: At the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy contained in these texts began to be extended by notable scholastics such as Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus and Duns Scotus. Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his Opus Majus. Pierre Duhem's provocative thesis of the Catholic Church's Condemnation of 1277 led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, \\"but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277\\".

It's the Arizona Territory of the 1880s. The stagecoach is going from Contention City to Bisbee and is only a few miles from its destination. A group of men on horseback herd cattle to block the path of the stage. After it stops and the dust clears, we see that the men are a band of thieves, some with their guns drawn. The owner of the stage line, Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), is on board, and the target of the robbery is a gold shipment atop the stage. Small-time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two young sons, Mark (Jerry Hartleben) and Mathew (Barry Curtis), are on horseback looking for their errant cattle. Dan hears the cattle over the ridge, and they ride over to where they can see the robbery in progress. Dan waits for the dust to settle, but the robbers spot him, and their leader, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), tells him to stay where he is--he'll get his cattle back in five minutes.As one of the robbers passes down the gold, the driver, Bill Moons (Boyd Stockman), draws his own gun and grabs the man as a shield. The gang leader draws and fires off two shots--one that kills his own man to clear the line of sight and one that kills Bill Moons. Mark asks his father if he isn't going to do something, but Dan sees there's nothing he can do without getting himself shot. He recognizes the robbers as Ben Wade and his gang. Wade has words with Mr. Butterfield and instructs him to return the driver's body to Contention City where he lived. \\"Where a man lives, that's where he should be buried.\\" Wade then confiscates Dan's horses so he won't ride to the marshal.

Article: One of the most important aspects of planning a trip to Iceland to catch the northern lights is to choose the right time of the year. Typically, the lights are most active from early September to the end of April each year, largely due to the longer periods of darkness during the winter. Plan a trip during these months to give yourself the best chance of seeing the northern lights. Light pollution from cities and houses can really decrease visibility of the night sky. So if you want to see the northern lights in Iceland, you should choose a destination that is removed from the lights of the city. Avoid Reykjavik and Akureyri, where light pollution may be too severe for you to see the northern lights. If you are stuck in a town with no way out into the countryside, try heading toward the outskirts of town or finding a darker area – like the Grótta Lighthouse or a park inside Reykjavik. These regions have longer hours of full darkness and, as a result, provide greater opportunities to catch the northern lights. You will be more likely to see them the farther north you travel in Iceland. Consider traveling to the Westfjords or the most extreme north locations in Iceland. These areas have about 2 more hours of darkness (22 hours total) than Reykjavik during the peak winter months. There are many places to go camping in rural Iceland, and spending a night underneath the stars greatly increases your chances of seeing the northern lights. Camping will give you hours of observation time in a remote, dark area. There are about 170 registered campsites in Iceland for you to choose from, but Icelandic law also allows you to pitch a tent for 1 night in residential, non-campsite areas. Just remember that Iceland can be quite cold in prime northern lights viewing months. If you plan to sleep outdoors, you’ll need to bring warm clothes, blankets, insulated sleeping bags, and a sturdy tent to protect yourself from the elements. Sign up for a guided tour that has a goal of northern lights sightings. The local tour guides will have a better idea about where to go and what the likelihood will be of seeing the lights. You can also take a boat cruise in the dark hours. People who go on these kinds of tours are often very successful at viewing the northern lights. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is: To best experience the northern lights in Iceland, plan your trip between September and April and choose a destination away from city lights.

Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day.

Which person studied less about volcanoes in an island arc? Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Hole in the wall The answer is:","completion":"Title: \\"Breaking the Wall\\" Genre: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama Plot Summary: In the late 1800s, a cunning and charming outlaw named Butch Cassidy leads a notorious gang, the Hole in the Wall. The gang performs several heists and train robberies, living a life of adventure and peril. The film follows the members of the gang as they face off against lawmen, form unique relationships within their ranks, and trouble the society of their time, all while staying loyal to their passionate beliefs in freedom, camaraderie, and adventure. Act 1: In the small town of Sundance, Wyoming, the Hole in the Wall gang carries out a risky bank heist while evading the pursuit of law enforcement. Members of the gang include Butch Cassidy, his right-hand man Sundance Kid, getaway driver Tommy \\"Speed\\" Smith, explosives expert Hank \\"Dynamite\\" Jones, and sharp-shooting beauty, Eliza Grey. The gang works their way through various towns and territories, acquiring admirers and rivals along the way. Act 2: The gang has a code: they will not harm innocent civilians. However, during a train heist, a member of the gang, Jasper Boone, inadvertently causes the death of a conductor. This incident leads to a fallout within the gang, as its members are torn between their code and their loyalty to one another. The impact of the conductor's death weighs heavily on the gang, especially Jasper, who is wracked with guilt and decides that he must atone for his actions. Act 3: The Hole in the Wall gang's notoriety attracts the attention of a legendary group of lawmen called the Pinkerton Agents, led by their relentless and calculating leader, Marshal Douglas Hunt. Hunt rounds up a posse to capture Cassidy and his gang. As the Marshal and the Pinkerton Agents close in on the gang, tensions rise within the group. After a final heist goes awry, Tom Speed loses his life, and the gang finds themselves cornered by Marshal Hunt and his men in a tense stand-off. Act 4: Jasper, burdened by the guilt of his past mistakes, voluntarily surrenders to the Pinkerton Agents in exchange for assurances that his comrades will be spared from the gallows. The remaining gang members are amazed by Jasper's bravery and sacrifice, which ignites a spark of redemption in each of them. The gang members, unwilling to face capture, part ways and disappear into the night. Act 5: Marshal Hunt, feeling conflicted about the outcome of the standoff, retires from law enforcement, only to receive news years later that the Hole in the Wall gang members have turned their lives around. Butch Cassidy becomes a rancher in Argentina, Sundance Kid starts a horse training business, Hank Jones becomes a master blacksmith, and Eliza Grey starts a school for orphaned children. The film ends with the revelation that Jasper's sacrifice for his fellow gang members had a profound impact on their lives, forever changing the course of their futures.

To do this, follow these detailed steps: 1. Position yourself properly: As the ski lift approaches the unloading area, make sure your snowboard is parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the chairlift. You want to be sitting on the edge of the chairlift seat, with your back foot resting on your snowboard's stomp pad. 2. Look ahead and survey the area: Pay attention to other skiers and snowboarders in the unloading area. Identify a clear path where you can smoothly exit the lift. 3. Prepare to land: When the chairlift arrives at the platform, bend your knees slightly and lean forward, getting ready to use your snowboard as a platform to stand on. Make sure your front foot is securely strapped into the binding and your back foot is still on the stomp pad. 4. Exit the lift: Gently push off the chairlift seat with your hands while transferring your weight from the edge of the seat to your snowboard. Use your free back foot to guide your snowboard onto the snow, maintaining balance as both your board and the chairlift continue to move forward. 5. Glide away: Once you've landed on the snow, continue to glide forward, keeping your knees slightly bent and your weight centered over your snowboard. Steer with your back foot and avoid leaning too far forward or backward. 6. Safe distance: Glide a safe distance away from the unloading area to prevent collisions with incoming skiers and snowboarders. Make sure not to stop suddenly; this can cause a bottleneck for others trying to exit the lift. 7. Strap in your back foot: Once you are clear of the unloading area, come to a complete stop by applying pressure on your heel or toe edge, depending on your preferred braking method. Set your snowboard on a flat surface, and strap your back foot into the binding. 8. Check your gear: Before you continue snowboarding, take a moment to ensure all your equipment is secure and in good condition. Double-check your bindings, and make any necessary adjustments. 9. Plan your route: Familiarize yourself with the terrain and resort map to determine your desired route. Identify trails that match your snowboarding skill level and any landmarks that will help you navigate the mountain. 10. Enjoy the rest of your day: With your gear secure and route planned, proceed down the mountain and enjoy your snowboarding experience. Remember to always be aware of your surroundings and other riders to ensure safety for everyone.

Answer the following question: An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen . Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. Two groups f people presented allergy symptoms. Group Alpha inhaled some allergens, but they were in a very protected environment, while Group Beta ingested some allergens and was exposed to a wide variety of other allergens. Which group had some people that were exposed to certain medications? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Group Beta had some people that were exposed to certain medications. The reason for this inference is that while both groups presented allergy symptoms, Group Alpha was in a very protected environment and only inhaled allergens. This suggests that the allergens causing their symptoms were limited to those that can be airborne, such as pollen or dust mites. On the other hand, Group Beta not only ingested allergens but was also exposed to a wide variety of other allergens. Given that the exposure to various allergens was more diverse in Group Beta, it is more likely that some people in this group came into contact with specific medications that could trigger allergies. Additionally, since Group Beta ingested allergens, it's possible that some of the allergens they consumed could have been medications or substances with similar properties. Allergic reactions to medications are not uncommon, and they can vary in severity from mild symptoms, such as skin rash or itching, to more severe ones, such as anaphylaxis. These types of medication-induced allergies can be triggered by various classes of drugs, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen), and anticonvulsants, among others. It is crucial to note that accurately determining whether someone in Group Beta was exposed to certain medications would require further investigation and examination of each individual's specific case. Ideally, this would involve gathering additional information about the allergy symptoms they displayed, the allergens they were exposed to, and their medical history, including any known allergies to medications. Moreover, allergy testing could be conducted to confirm the trigger for their allergic reaction. This might include skin tests, blood tests, or supervised oral drug challenges, where small amounts of the suspected medication are administered in a controlled environment to observe the individual's response. In conclusion, it is more likely that Group Beta had some people who were exposed to certain medications, as they were subjected to a wider range of allergens and also ingested allergens. However, to confirm this assumption, more information and testing would be necessary to establish a clear connection between the individuals' allergic symptoms and the specific medications to which they may have been exposed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

În contextul dreptului european al concurenţei, sectorul autovehiculelor este guvernat din anul 1985 de un regulament general privind exceptarea pe categorii, pentru a se ţine cont de caracteristicile sale specifice: situaţia de oligopol, produse de înaltă tehnicitate şi durată de viaţă îndelungată. Translate this to English?","completion":"In the context of European competition law, the automotive sector has been governed since 1985 by a general regulation on block exemptions, taking into account its specific characteristics: an oligopolistic situation, high-tech and long-lasting products. In the context of the European competition law, the automotive sector holds a special place, given its unique features. Since 1985, it has been regulated by a general regulation concerning block exemptions, aiming to address the specific characteristics of this sector: the oligopolistic situation of the market, the high-technology, and the extended lifespan of the products. An oligopolistic situation stands for a market that is highly concentrated among a small number of large firms. This often results in those key companies having significant influence on the market, which in turn can affect competition. The automotive sector generally exhibits this type of market structure, with a limited number of major manufacturers dominating the market. In addition to the oligopolistic state of the market, the automotive sector is also characterized by producing high-tech and long-lasting products. This particularity makes this industry distinct from other industries in terms of competition. High-tech goods require substantial investment in research and development (R&D), as well as continuous innovation to meet the ever-growing demand for advanced technology. These investments contribute to consolidating the market's oligopolistic character, as smaller companies may struggle to keep pace with larger competitors regarding R&D. Furthermore, the long-lasting nature of automotive products implies that consumers are less likely to purchase vehicles frequently. Consequently, this results in a sector relatively less dynamic in terms of competition, with fewer transactional opportunities to enter the market. The general regulation on block exemptions, introduced in 1985, was designed to account for these specific aspects of the automotive sector under the European competition law. By applying this regulation, it aims to maintain a balanced competitive environment and prevent large manufacturers from abusing their dominant position in the market. Additionally, it allows for more flexibility in the application of the rules, especially when innovation and highly technical aspects are involved, ensuring that the overall competitiveness of the European automotive sector prevails in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Fruit-eating bats receive food from plants and, in return, help these plants by doing what? A: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the question being asked. The question concerns the relationship between fruit-eating bats and plants, specifically what the bats do to help plants in return for receiving food from them. Step 2: Research or recall relevant information about fruit-eating bats and their role in plant ecosystems. Fruit-eating bats, also known as frugivorous bats, are important pollinators and seed dispersers in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. They primarily feed on fruits and nectar of various plants.

Explicație detaliată și lungă: Recent, Milos Bugarin, liderul Camerei de Comerț a Serbiei, a făcut o declarație în care susține că produsele provenite din Kosovo nu au fost boicotate de către Serbia. Această afirmație vine în contextul în care relațiile economice dintre cele două state sunt tensionate din cauza disputelor politice și istorice dintre ele. Acest lucru este important, deoarece boicotul reprezintă un act voluntar de a nu cumpăra, vinde sau utiliza anumite bunuri sau servicii dintr-un anumit loc sau țară. Când o țară își boicotează vecinul, pot apărea consecințe economice negative, cum ar fi pierderea locurilor de muncă, scăderea veniturilor și creșterea tensiunilor politice. Prin negarea unui astfel de boicot, Bugarin încearcă să transmită un mesaj de stabilitate și cooperare între Serbia și Kosovo în ceea ce privește comerțul și relațiile economice. Aceasta înseamnă că Serbia nu a avut intenția de a destabiliza economia Kosovo-ului prin refuzul de a cumpăra produsele acestuia și de a afecta negativ populația și mediul de afaceri din această țară. Totuși, este important de menționat că, deși Bugarin a negat un boicot oficial, există posibilitatea ca persoane sau organizații individuale să fi luat măsuri de boicotare în mod independent de deciziile guvernului sau ale Camerei de Comerț. Aceasta ar putea însemna că, în ciuda acestor afirmații, produsele provenite din Kosovo s-au confruntat cu rezistență pe piața locală din Serbia. În concluzie, afirmativa lui Milos Bugarin cu privire la inexistența unui boicot al produselor kosovare de către Serbia reflectă intențiile autorităților sârbe de a menține relații economice stabile cu Kosovo, în ciuda tensiunilor politice existente. Fie că această declarație este un efort de a indrepta percepțiile față de Serbia, fie că reprezintă realitatea situației economice actuale dintre cele două țări, rămâne de văzut.

In morning trading , the Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.76 , or 0.1 percent , at 9,310.20 , having gained 201 points Monday . (See options at the end). If the first sentence is true, is the second one also true? Select from the following. (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(a). No Here is the explanation: The given scenario presents two trading situations for the Dow Jones industrial average on what seems to be the same day. According to the first sentence, by late afternoon, the Dow Jones was up 12.81 points, or 0.1 percent, at 9,331.77. This implies that during the course of the day, it gained 12.81 points to reach this figure. The second sentence seems to portray the morning trading situation of the same day. However, it states that the Dow Jones was down 8.76 points, or 0.1 percent, at 9,310.20. This disparity, the index down in the morning and then up in the afternoon, isn't the issue; it's normal for the index to fluctuate throughout the day. The anomaly resides in the specifics of the numbers provided. According to the first sentence, the Dow Jones had been gaining from a certain base number (which we can calculate by subtracting 12.81 from 9331.77, giving us 9318.96). But the second sentence puts the morning figure at 9310.20, which is lower than the base number we have calculated based on the first sentence. Also, both sentences detail that the Dow Jones had gained 201 points on Monday to its highest level since July 2002. This information from two distinct periods of the same day should align, yet the numerical details provided (9310.20 vs 9331.77) show a discrepancy in the values. Consequently, the information in the second sentence is contradictory to the first sentence, making it untrue if the first sentence is considered true.

I read this background article the other day: As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson. I am facing a new situation today: Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature.

The ship is in Philadelphia harbor, filled with equipment from a team led by James Longstreet (Eric Christmas). During the experiment the equipment begins malfunctioning. Observers simply see the ship disappear but sailors on board experience a bizarre and disorienting phase shift. David and Jim try to shut down the generator to stop the experiment but receive severe electric shocks when they touch the equipment. The two men jump overboard to escape. Instead of landing in Philadelphia harbor during the daytime, David and Jim land during the night in a small desert town, which then disappears as well, leaving them in the dark open desert. They are startled by the appearance of bright light in the sky - it's a military helicopter with a spotlight looking for intruders. They escape into the desert and eventually find their way to a diner the next day. An energy discharge from Jim destroys an arcade game in the diner, and the upset diner owner grabs a revolver, demanding Jim pay for the damages. David grabs the gun and the men run and carjack a car in the parking lot. Since he is unfamiliar with the automatic transmission, David takes the driver - a woman named Allison (Nancy Allen) - as a hostage and driver.

David explains that he and Jim accidentally traveled through time, but no one believes the story. Jim eventually disappears from his hospital bed in a corona of energy.

Many people still remember when they were young, they often played games like hide-and-seek and chess. Playing teaches children how to get along with others, and it also helps to exercise the mind and body. However, children today spent most of their playing time in front of the computer, playing video games. A recent survey found that in the US children between 8 and 12 spent at least 13 hours a week playing video games or \\"gaming\\". Boys of this age spend even more time, almost 16 hours a week. Although some people will say that gaming is helpful, it brings many problems as well. One big problem is that kids who spend most of their time on games might have difficulty communicating with real people. They might have trouble sharing and resolving problems because they do not practice these shills when sitting alone at a computer. Another problem is about health. Game players usually sit for hours without doing any exercise. And they might not eat healthily. As a result, they might be out of shape. Next, game players might have trouble with their lessons.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Drunken driving--sometimes called America's socially accepted form of murder--has become a national epidemic . Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution.

Answer this question: who came up with the big 5 personality theory??","completion":"The Big Five personality theory, also known as the Five-Factor Model (FFM), is a widely accepted and well-established psychological model that seeks to explain the nuances of human personality through five broad dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN). This model has its roots in the Lexical Hypothesis, which suggests that the most important individual-differences are encoded into natural language. The development of the Big Five personality theory is a result of the collaborative effort of several researchers over an extended period. The foundation was initially laid by two independent research teams working during the 1960s and 1970s: 1. Warren T. Norman’s team at the University of Michigan, including notable contributions by researchers such as Louis R. Goldberg and Raymond Cattell. 2. Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal’s team at the U.S. Air Force Personnel Laboratory, involving significant contributions from J.M. Digman and numerous other researchers through the years. The initial work from Tupes and Christal in 1961 was based on the psychological analysis of military servicemen within the U.S. Air Force. At the time, they identified five broad factors for personality traits – a striking resemblance to the Big Five model known today. Although their research was groundbreaking, it went relatively unnoticed by the scientific community at the time, especially since their paper was published in an Air Force Technical Report, rather than an academic journal. Simultaneously, Norman and his team, building upon the work of psychologists like Cattell and Gordon Allport, developed their research by assessing thousands of adjectives found in the English language. These adjectives were reduced in number to describe the most significant personality differences. Norman’s team eventually arrived at similar conclusions regarding the existence of five overarching factors. However, the Big Five framework only began to gain wider acceptance during the 1980s, primarily due to the work of psychologists Paul Costa and Robert McCrae. They further developed the theory and validated it through various systematic techniques, including statistical methodologies like factor analysis. Costa and McCrae's work eventually led to the creation of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) – an assessment instrument widely used to measure the Big Five personality traits. In conclusion, the development of the Big Five personality theory is attributed to various psychologists and researchers, including Tupes and Christal, Norman, Goldberg, Cattell, Costa, and McCrae, who worked collectively over several decades to approximate human personality in a comprehensive and empirically supported manner. The Big Five theory's legacy reflects academic collaboration and the gradual accumulation of knowledge to deepen our understanding of human personality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What's the name of the girl Father Lind and Pamela argue about? ? Father Gregory Lind, is a Catholic priest struggling with his life in the priesthood. He wishes to change parishes, but is denied the transfer time after time. The story starts with him arriving at the local hospital after being informed that one of his charges is dying after trying to steal a car. He meets there Pamela Gibson – a widowed and rich social worker from the local Community Center. Together they decide to find out more about the deceased teen. The pair checks up on Estella Rios, the boy's pregnant, underage girlfriend. They don't agree on what should be done about her and later Father Lind finds out from Mrs. Rios that Pamela took Estalla to probably get an abortion. This leads to more arguments between the two, but they lose importance when the girl ends up in a hospital and miscarries. The social worker breaks down and Father Lind ends up having sex with her, after taking her back home. Answer:","completion":"The name of the girl Father Lind and Pamela argue about is Estella Rios."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter. I’m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not.

Choose from: [A]. negative [B]. positive I think the answer is","completion":"[B]. positive The sentiment embodied by this tweet can be described as positive for multiple reasons. Firstly, the tweet expresses the user's satisfaction and happiness with their breakfast experience. The use of the word \\"great\\" in describing the breakfast shows an enthusiastic and upbeat tone. This positive sentiment is further emphasized by the presence of the word \\"daddy\\" which indicates a close relationship between the user and their father. Sharing a meal with a loved one typically represents a moment of bonding and happiness, reflecting a positive emotion. Another aspect that suggests a positive sentiment in this tweet is the user's anticipation of spending time outdoors, soaking up the sun. The phrase \\"about to go lay out\\" implies that the user is looking forward to taking a break and enjoying the sunlight, a common activity associated with relaxation and leisure. The addition of the word \\"sunnn\\" with an elongated last letter, along with the extra 'n's indicating excitement and further magnifying the positive outlook.

Premise: The blacksmith's shop in the center of the village became the focus of this activity because it was the blacksmith who often officiated at these ceremonies, striking his anvil with a hammer to signify that the union was official. Hypothesis: The blacksmith shop is always busy with customers. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While it is true that the blacksmith's shop in the center of the village became the focus of this activity because the blacksmith often officiated at ceremonies, this information does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the blacksmith shop is always busy with customers. The premise and the hypothesis are related, yet distinct concepts. The premise provides us with information about the significance and role of the blacksmith's shop in the village's traditions and ceremonies. It tells us that the shop was central to the union ceremonies, and that the blacksmith played an important part in solidifying these unions. By striking his anvil with a hammer, the blacksmith symbolically linked the union of two people with the strong and lasting nature of forged metal. However, the hypothesis focuses on the business aspect of the blacksmith's shop. It posits that the shop is always busy with customers, but the premise given does not provide any direct evidence supporting this claim. We know that the blacksmith's shop held a central role in certain ceremonies, but that does not guarantee constant customer activity within the shop. It is plausible to assume that the blacksmith's shop might be busier than other shops due to its central role in village ceremonies and perhaps because the blacksmith would be providing services like forging tools and fixing equipment. However, it is crucial to differentiate between the shop's importance in ceremonies and its overall customer traffic. The premise provided does not give sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the blacksmith shop is always busy with customers. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While the blacksmith's shop has a significant role in village ceremonies and traditions, this fact does not directly lead to the conclusion that the shop would always be busy with customers. The premise and hypothesis are related, but they focus on different aspects of the blacksmith's shop: one on its symbolic and ceremonial relevance, the other on its commercial success and customer traffic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Infectious disease occurs when a person is infected by a pathogen from another person or an animal. It is a problem that causes harm at both individual and macro scales. The Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) operates a surveillance system to minimize infectious disease contagions. However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading. We believe that this study's models can help eliminate reporting delays in existing surveillance systems and, therefore, minimize costs to society.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Orci was born in Mexico City on July 20, 1973, to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother. His mother immigrated to the United States with her parents after Fidel Castro came to power. Orci grew up in Mexico, and moved with his family to the United States at the age of 10. He was raised in Texas, Los Angeles and Canada. In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman confirmed to Variety that they are no longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate on television. Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider-Man film franchise, while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3. Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman's K/O Paper Products continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios, and has created the series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O'Brien for the 2014-15 season and Limitless was created for the 2015-16 season from the 2011 film. Prior to the split of Kurtzman and Orci, the duo were lined up to write the third film in the new Star Trek series. In May 2014, Skydance and Paramount Pictures announced that Orci was to direct the third installment of the Star Trek reboot franchise, after Abrams moved on to direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This would have marked Orci's directorial debut, and he was to write the script alongside co-writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay. Due to his commitment to Star Trek 3, he dropped out of a new Power Rangers film, for which he would have been executive producer. But on December 5, it was announced he would no longer be directing the Star Trek film. He remains credited as a producer on the film, and was replaced by Doug Jung and cast member Simon Pegg as the script writers after Orci's initial script was dropped. Orci was replaced as director by Justin Lin, who had previously directed films in The Fast and the Furious franchise. Orci created Matador with the idea that the main character would be a \\"soccer player by day who is a spy by night\\", and called him a \\"Latin James Bond\\". The series was broadcast on the El Rey Network created by Robert Rodriguez. It was renewed for a second season shortly before the pilot was broadcast, which had been directed by Rodriguez.

Mary and I (as you may remember) had left the bailiff alone at the decoy, and had set forth on our way together to Dermody's cottage. As we approached the garden gate, I saw a servant from the house waiting there. He carried a message from my mother--a message for me. \\"My mistress wishes you to go home, Master George, as soon as you can. A letter has come by the coach. My master means to take a post-chaise from London, and sends word that we may expect him in the course of the day.\\" Mary's attentive face saddened when she heard those words. \\"Must you really go away, George,\\" she whispered, \\"before you see what I have got waiting for you at home?\\" I remembered Mary's promised \\"surprise,\\" the secret of which was only to be revealed to me when we got to the cottage.

We crept quietly into our places. Mary waited until she saw her grandmother's gray head bend down, and her grandmother's bushy eyebrows contract attentively, over her reading.

Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command.

Here is an article: President Barack Obama signaled Monday he'll propose a major infrastructure program and an extension of a payroll tax break in the jobs speech he planned to deliver Thursday before a joint session of Congress. In an animated Labor Day talk before an enthusiastic crowd of union members in Detroit, Mr. Obama, who has been battered by low poll numbers and a sense that he's been unable to recharge the economy, sought to seize the initiative at the outset of a week in which both parties will focus heavily on job-creation ideas. \\"We've got roads and bridges across this country that need to be rebuilt,\\" Mr. Obama said. \\"We've got private companies with the equipment and manpower to do the building. We've got more than one million unemployed construction workers ready to get dirty right now.\\" President Barack Obama at a Labor Day event in Detroit. Mr. Obama also stressed his desire to extend a payroll tax holiday for workers, which has reduced the Social Security tax rate from 6.2% to 4.2% of earnings but expires at year's end. Mr. Obama didn't mention whether he will also push to expand the reduction to cover employers, who also pay 6.2%, an idea backed by some in the administration. \\"I think putting money back in the pockets of working families is the best way to get demand rising, because that means businesses hiring and that means the economy growing,\\" Mr. Obama said. As important as the speech's content was its tone. It was feisty and framed in part as a challenge to Republicans to join his jobs push and, as the president put it, to prove they care as much about the middle class as they say they do. Mr. Obama delivered the address as his approval ratings had slipped to the lowest of his presidency, with voters frustrated he and members of Congress had been unable to jump-start the economy. Adding to the frustration was a report Friday showing that the U.S. created no new jobs in August and unemployment remained at 9.1%. Both parties are focusing on jobs this week. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is laying out his jobs plan Tuesday in Las Vegas. The GOP candidates hold a debate on Wednesday—the first to include Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the newly minted front-runner—and job creation will likely to be a major topic. Mr. Obama is scheduled to deliver his address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday evening, promising to offer a broad plan to add more jobs. The White House has been debating whether to put forth a limited package that both parties can agree on, or to offer a grander vision that is unlikely to pass Congress but could serve as a rallying point for Democrats heading toward the election and to underline the differences between the two parties. Both parties are aware of polls showing the public deeply disenchanted with the bickering that surrounded the recent debate on raising the federal debt limit. Both have sought in recent days to show they're willing to reach across party lines, as Mr. Obama did Monday. \\"I still believe both parties can work together to solve our problems,\\" said the president. \\"Given the urgency of this moment, given the hardship families are facing, we've got to get together.\\" He balanced that with strong words for Republicans, addressing a concern among many rank-and-file Democrats that the president has not done enough to challenge Republicans. \\"We're going to see if we've got some straight-shooters in Congress,\\" Mr. Obama said. \\"You say you're the party of tax cuts. Prove you'll fight as hard for tax cuts for working families as for oil companies and most affluent Americans. Show us what you've got.\\" In recent days, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.) has said Republicans could support at least parts of Mr. Obama's infrastructure plans, particularly a proposal to give states more control over such projects. He has also cited Mr. Obama's support of a Georgia program, popular with Republicans, that allows companies to audition workers for eight weeks while the workers receive unemployment checks. The next few months could be critical for both parties. Congress will struggle to strike another budget deal, Republicans will try to sort out their presidential field, and Mr. Obama will work to regain his footing—and all will wait to see if the economy shows more signs of life. After the Thursday speech, Mr. Obama plans to travel the country promoting his job-creation ideas. It starts Friday with a trip to Richmond, Va.

These techniques have been employed to transform multiple McDonald's establishments in different Spanish cities into a spectacular display. To provide you with specific details, let's delve into the strategies and processes involved in this transformation. First, it is essential to analyze the location and demographic of each Spanish city where a McDonald's establishment is present. Oftentimes, a city's culture, history, and dominant age group can influence the overall atmosphere and marketing strategies that would be effective. One technique used is the incorporation of the local culture and architectural styles in the interior and exterior design of the McDonald's establishments. By blending with the city's historic and cultural appeal, McDonald's creates an atmosphere that resonates with local patrons. This could include elements such as Spanish-tiled floors, intricate ironwork accents, or even incorporating regional artworks and materials. Another technique is to create a digital, immersive experience within the McDonald's establishments. This can include interactive touchscreens showcasing the local city's highlights, upcoming events, or special promotions. These digital features can keep customers engaged while waiting for their orders, enhancing their overall experience and visiting frequency. Customizing the menu and offerings according to regional preferences and local seasonal ingredients is another technique McDonald's adopts in different Spanish cities. By offering regional dishes and adapting to local tastes, McDonald's demonstrates its commitment to understanding and catering to the unique preferences and needs of various Spanish communities. Focusing on local artistic and theatrical scenes, McDonald's may also opt to host events, sponsor shows, or support community initiatives in these Spanish cities. This could involve collaborating with local talents and artists, creating unique events, or sponsoring relevant celebrations. The aim is to connect with the locals and create a sense of community and belonging around the McDonald's brand. In line with the idea of collaboration, McDonald's may also partner with local schools, universities, or businesses to offer internships, scholarships, or other opportunities. This fosters goodwill and allows the brand to form strong connections with the community while providing valuable resources and support. Finally, sustainability initiatives can also be implemented in these McDonald's establishments. By adopting eco-friendly practices such as energy-efficient LED lighting, using solar panels, recycling waste, or installing electric vehicle charging stations, McDonald's demonstrates its dedication to environmental responsibility and stewardship, which can attract environmentally-conscious customers. In conclusion, transforming McDonald's establishments in different Spanish cities into spectacular shows implicates a combination of various techniques, including the incorporation of local culture and history, offering a customized menu, partnering with local businesses and schools, and implementing sustainability initiatives. These strategies not only enhance the customer experience but also build strong connections with the local community, ensuring a more profound integration of the McDonald's brand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: Article: The owner of a missing cat is asking for help. \\"My baby has been missing for over a month now, and I want him back so badly,\\" said Mrs. Brown, a 56-year-old woman. Mrs. Brown lives by herself in a trailer park near Clovis. She said that Clyde, her 7-year-old cat, didn't come home for dinner more than a month ago. The next morning he didn't appear for breakfast either. After Clyde missed an extra-special lunch, she called the police. When the policeman asked her to describe Clyde, she told him that Clyde had beautiful green eyes, had all his teeth but was missing half of his left ear, and was seven years old and completely white. She then told the officer that Clyde was about a foot high. A bell went off. \\"Is Clyde your child or your pet?\\" the officer suspiciously asked. \\"Well, he's my cat, of course,\\" Mrs. Brown replied. \\"Lady, you're supposed to report missing PERSONS, not missing CATS,\\" said the _ policeman. \\"Well, who can I report this to?\\" she asked. \\"You can't.

There was an empty billboard at the end of her street just off the interstate highway. The billboard had a phone number on it.

I went to this salon for the first time because my boyfriend lives in the apartment complex located behind the shopping plaza that Modern Salon is in. I made an appointment with the idea to get my hair cut and some fun color added into my long hair, kind of a rose gold ombre effect that is so popular right now. My appointment was with Janine. She is fantastic. Since I wanted something a little more complex she was very honest telling me that she does not quite have the skill level to give me the ombre coloring that I wanted and checked to see if there was another stylist available to do the color. Thankfully there was a senior stylist available to do the color. Janine went ahead and cut my hair beautifully and I would definitely go back to Janine for another hair cut. The senior stylist that squeezed me in for my color was awful. I regret that I do not remember her name. She had no patience for me. I had some pictures of the type of color effect I wanted and she kept arguing with me that all of the pictures were different and that I needed to pick one. I finally settled on one of the pictures as an example and she got to work. She did not talk to me the entire time, just to her assistants that were helping her juggle 3 clients at the same time. She added the color to my hair and as I sat with foil in, I realized she only did the top half of my head when she and I discussed doing the bottom around the face more. I got her attention again and asked if she was going to add more to the bottom and again she started arguing with me about how this is exactly what the picture showed and that I would see once she was done. Needless to say that it was not exactly what the picture was and not at all what I wanted. Since I have very dark hair and my hair took longer to lift to the desired color, she told me that I would have to go home and come back later that day or tomorrow for her to finish! I HAD TO GO HOME HALF BLONDE HALF BRUNETTE. It was NOT a good look for an Asian girl to have. I went to the front counter and when I was told what the total was for the day, I burst into tears (not my proudest moment). They immediately got the manager and I told her that her Senior Stylist was not listening to me and that I was horrified that I had to go home with half of a hair color. The manager was great and understood completely. She ended up comping the entire thing and scheduled me an appointment for the next day with a different stylist completely. The second stylist was Victoria. She was fantastic and listened and gave me exactly what I wanted. I would definitely go back to her.

Write an article with the title: \\"Obesity Rates Keep Rising, Troubling Health Officials\\"","completion":"Title: Obesity Rates Keep Rising, Troubling Health Officials Once upon a time, there lived a big group of people called Health Officials. These people had a job to take care of everyone's health. They made sure that everyone stayed fit and strong. But these days, they are feeling worried. This is because, more and more people are becoming obese. Obese means becoming very overweight. It's like having too much air in a balloon, making it bigger and bigger. Obesity rates mean how many people are obese in a given area, like a town or a country. Now, these rates are increasing, which means that more and more people are becoming obese. The Health Officials are unhappy about this because obesity can lead to many health problems. When you're obese, it can be hard to walk, run, or play with friends. It can also make you feel tired more easily. Obesity can also cause some other health problems like heart issues, diabetes and other illnesses. It's like trying to carry a big, heavy bag with you everywhere you go - it's not good for your body. There are many reasons why people become obese. One reason is eating too much of unhealthy food. Unhealthy food has less good stuff in it, like vitamins and minerals that make our bodies strong and healthy. Instead, they have lots of sugar, salt, and fat. These things can make us gain weight very fast. It's like watering a plant too much - it won't grow well if you give it more than it needs. Another reason for obesity is not exercising enough. Exercising is like a magical potion for our bodies - it helps us stay fit, healthy, and full of energy. But if we don't exercise, our bodies can become weak, and obesity may sneak in. To help people avoid becoming obese, the Health Officials are working on many plans. They want to teach everyone about eating healthy food and exercising regularly. They also want to help people who are already obese to become healthier again. When everyone works together to eat healthy and exercise, the obesity rates will not rise anymore, and the Health Officials will be happy again. So let's all do our part and live healthy lives, make good choices and stay strong!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing. What are dog teeth best suited for?","completion":"Dog teeth are best suited for catching, tearing, and grinding food. Let's break down the steps to justify this statement: Step 1: Analyze dog teeth structure and function Dogs have four main types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, each serving a specific purpose. Step 2: Connect teeth types to their functions - Incisors: These small, sharp teeth are situated at the front of the mouth and are used for nibbling and grooming. - Canines: Located on either side of the incisors, these long, pointed teeth can sink into prey and hold it firmly. They are primarily designed for stabbing, catching, and tearing food. - Premolars and molars: These teeth are located further back in the mouth and are designed to shear, crush, and grind food into smaller, more digestible pieces. Step 3: Take into account the carnivorous nature of dogs Dogs are predators and their teeth have evolved specifically for a carnivorous diet: catching, tearing meat, and breaking down bones. Step 4: Consider adaptation to domestication and diet changes Although domesticated dogs today might consume a wider range of food, their teeth still primarily function for their original carnivorous purpose. Modern dog diets include kibble and other processed dog foods that still require the use of tearing and grinding teeth for proper digestion. In conclusion, dog teeth are best suited for catching, tearing, and grinding food, adapted for their carnivorous nature and diet. Their different types of teeth work together to help dogs capture prey, tear meat, and break down food for easier digestion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"Jefferson's Statute of Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill, chiefly supported by Patrick Henry, which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination, but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What did Patrick Henry want to require Virginians to pay taxes to support?\\"","completion":"While the provided statement does indeed answer the question, it could be further expanded and explained in a more detailed manner for better understanding. Here is a more comprehensive response: Patrick Henry wanted to require Virginians to pay taxes to support a designated church or religious denomination. This concept was reflected in a proposed bill known as the \\"general assessment bill\\" or the \\"Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,” which Henry was a key supporter of. The bill aimed to give Virginians the freedom to choose a Christian denomination, but it would have also required them to financially support their chosen church through taxes. The assessment bill was rooted in the long-standing practice of using tax money to fund the established church in the early American colonies. In Virginia, the Anglican Church (the Church of England) was the official state church and was funded by public taxes. However, after the American Revolution, many people began to disapprove of the government's support for a single church, and they called for a disestablishment of the state religion. As a result, the assessment bill was introduced as a compromise, giving Virginians the choice to support different Christian denominations but still requiring them to fund one through taxes. In opposition to Patrick Henry's supported bill, Thomas Jefferson drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which advocated for the complete separation of church and state. This statute opposed the government's collection of taxes for religious purposes and emphasized an individual's right to determine their religious beliefs without interference from the government or mandatory funding for any religious institutions. Jefferson's Statute for Religious Freedom was eventually enacted in 1786, leading to the disestablishment of the state religion in Virginia. This landmark legislation would go on to influence the First Amendment of the US Constitution, ensuring freedom of religion and preventing the government from establishing or endorsing any specific religious denomination. In summary, Patrick Henry wanted Virginians to pay taxes in support of a chosen Christian denomination, reflecting the compromise position in the assessment bill he supported. However, Thomas Jefferson's Statute of Religious Freedom ultimately triumphed, ensuring the separation of church and state and the freedom to practice religion without mandatory financial support."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The US Air Force Fitness Test (AFFT) is designed to test the abdominal circumference, muscular strength/endurance and cardiovascular respiratory fitness of airmen in the USAF. As part of the Fit to Fight program, the USAF adopted a more stringent physical fitness assessment; the new fitness program was put into effect on 1 June 2010. The annual ergo-cycle test which the USAF had used for several years had been replaced in 2004. In the AFFT, Airmen are given a score based on performance consisting of four components: waist circumference, the sit-up, the push-up, and a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run. Airmen can potentially earn a score of 100, with the run counting as 60%, waist circumference as 20%, and both strength test counting as 10% each. A passing score is 75 points. Effective 1 July 2010, the AFFT is administered by the base Fitness Assessment Cell (FAC), and is required twice a year. Personnel may test once a year if he or she earns a score above a 90%. Additionally, only meeting the minimum standards on each one of these tests will not get you a passing score of 75%, and failing any one component will result in a failure for the entire test.

Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in.

The purges targeted perceived political adversaries, as well as Soviet citizens from various social backgrounds, who were accused of disloyalty and other charges. These actions led to mass incarceration, deportations, and executions, affecting a significant portion of the Soviet population. Joseph Stalin directed the purges on a national level, while his associates and regional leaders carried out the orders at local levels. During this period, Stalin began purging the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of anyone he deemed a threat or was dissatisfied with. He sought to rid the party of any remaining followers of Leon Trotsky or any external influences. This campaign of political repression targeted not just party members but also military personnel, intelligentsia, cultural figures, and ordinary citizens. Noteworthy individuals involved in carrying out the purges at various levels include Nikolai Yezhov, who headed the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) and oversaw the arrests and executions during the height of the purge. Another prominent figure was Lavrentiy Beria, who took over the NKVD after Yezhov and continued the purges on a smaller scale. Bobojon Ghafurov, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, held his position from 1946-1956, after the peak of the Great Purge. Although he was a prominent Tajikistani politician during the Soviet Era, he neither directed nor executed the purges in the Soviet Union."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When multiplying the force applied by the perpendicular component of the moment arm, we are finding the torque. Torque is a measure of rotational force, often represented by the Greek letter tau (τ). Step-by-step explanation: 1. Recognize that the multiplication of force and the perpendicular component of the moment arm is described in the formula for torque: τ = F × d, where F is the force applied and d is the perpendicular distance between the axis of rotation and the line of action of the force. 2. Determine the answer using the given choices: - radiation is not related to force and moment arm - intensities usually refer to the strength or concentration of a physical quantity, not force or moment arm - pressure is the force per unit area, not calculated by multiplying force and the moment arm - torques are related to force and the moment arm, as they measure rotational force Therefore, the correct answer is D: torques."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The figure makes it the strongest worldwide debut ever - marginally overtaking the 529m (£421.8m) taken by Star Wars: The Force Awakens. However, the film's US takings were down sharply on the previous movie. Furious 7 opened with 147.2m (£117.3m) in the US when it was released in 2015 - but the latest instalment of the series debuted with 100.2m (£80m). The Fate of the Furious - titled Fast & Furious 8 in some territories - stars Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel, who said he felt \\"grateful, humbled and blessed\\" after the film's success. Why is the Fast & Furious franchise so popular? Rhianna Dhillon, film critic and host of BBC Radio 4's Seriously... podcast, said the success of the Fast & Furious franchise is down to its \\"universal appeal\\". \\"They're films people of all ages can enjoy, because they have that pure, unadulterated escapism about them, children and adults alike are quite happy to watch things get blown up and smashed up,\\" she said. \\"A lot of what drags movies like The Avengers down is the plot, and Fast & Furious isn't trying to compete with those heavy, convoluted storylines. This is just cars smashing into each other and it's okay to enjoy that. \\"This franchise isn't trying to be anything it's not. Ultimately, from the bottom up, it doesn't take itself too seriously.\\" Dhillon said the diversity of the cast is one of the key reasons the film series has seen continued box office success. \\"Hollywood really underestimates minority audiences,\\" she said. \\"For example, if you break down the figures, the Latino audience is huge, what with Vin Diesel's following. I think that has so much to do with it, because not many films offer that.\\" She added: \\"The franchise still attracts huge stars each time - this year as the villain we have Charlize Theron, there's an appearance from Helen Mirren. These aren't people you've never heard of, they have the most bankable movie stars in the world. \\"And Dwayne Johnson has given the films a new lease of life - when you buy a star like him, you're buying his fans as well.\\" Find out more: The Secret of The Fast and The Furious Despite the drop of nearly a third on the seventh film, the US performance of The Fate of the Furious is still pretty impressive - it accounted for nearly two-thirds of all US box office takings over the weekend. Its nearest competitor was The Boss Baby, which took a further 15.5m (£12.4m) to land second place. The film's worldwide performance was boosted by opening in China on the same weekend as other major markets, unlike the Force Awakens, which did not start screening there until several weeks later. The Fate of the Furious saw three-day takings of 190m (£151m) in China. More chapters in the Furious franchise, which began in 2001, are planned for release in 2019 and 2021.

In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Answer this question: what are loan originations? The answer is:","completion":"Loan originations refer to the process of creating a new loan or credit agreement between a borrower and a lender. This process involves several steps, including the borrower's application for the loan, the lender's evaluation of the borrower's creditworthiness, the negotiation of loan terms and conditions, and the signing of the loan agreement by both parties. Loan originations occur when individuals or businesses seek financing for various purposes, such as purchasing a home, buying a car, starting a business, or funding educational expenses. The process typically begins when the borrower submits an application to a lender, such as a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. This application includes information about the borrower's financial history, income, employment status, and other relevant factors. Once the lender receives the application, it conducts an assessment to determine the borrower's creditworthiness, which is their ability and likelihood to repay the loan. This evaluation may involve checking the borrower's credit score, reviewing their financial history, and verifying their income and employment status. If the lender determines that the borrower is a suitable candidate for the loan, it then presents the loan terms and conditions to the borrower. The loan terms and conditions include various details about the lending agreement, such as the loan amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, and any applicable fees or penalties. The borrower and lender negotiate these terms until they reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. Once the terms are finalized, the borrower and lender sign the loan agreement, which legally binds them to the contract. Upon signing the agreement, the lender disburses the loan funds to the borrower, who is now responsible for repaying the loan according to the agreed-upon terms and conditions. The loan origination process is thus complete, and the borrower can use the funds for their intended purpose. It is essential to note that loan originations can vary depending on the type of loan and the specific requirements and regulations applicable to that loan. For example, the origination process for a mortgage loan (home loan) will differ from that of a student loan or a personal loan. Regardless of the loan type, however, the primary objective of loan originations is to create a legally binding credit agreement that outlines the borrower's obligation to repay the loan and the lender's rights in the event of default."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: \\"Are the beginning and ending dates for DST the same or changing every year?\\" Context: \\"Beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere.

Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency claims he tried to complain 10 times to his superiors. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden claims that he tried 10 times to make formal complaints about government spy programs but no one listened to him. According to testimony given to the European Parliament released on Friday the former NSA contractor claims that as a contractor, rather than a government worker, he was not protected from raising concerns and decided to take matters into his own hands. Instead of benefiting from Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 19, under which federal employees can question classified programs, Snowden felt that 'individuals like me were left with no proper channels.' 'As an employee of a private company rather than a direct employee of the U.S. government, I was not protected by U.S. whistle-blower laws, and I would not have been protected from retaliation and legal sanction for revealing classified information about lawbreaking in accordance with the recommended process,' Snowden said in his testimony according to the Washington Post. Snowden previously worked for the CIA before joining the NSA in Hawaii as a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton. Private: The Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp office building is seen in McLean, Virginia June 11, 2013. Contracting firm Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp fired Edward Snowden, after he admitted to releasing information on the U.S. government's broad monitoring of American's phone and Internet data. It was from there that he leaked information about the extent of NSA spying programs to the press before fleeing to Hong Kong and then seeking asylum in Russia. In his testimopny Snowden claimed that he was warned that his concerns were dangerous for his career and that he should keep his head down and maintain a low profile. 'The first were well-meaning but hushed warnings not to 'rock the boat,' for fear of the sort of retaliation that befell former NSA whistle-blowers like Wiebe, Binney, and Drake,' he said, according to the Post, before adding that the other responses were suggestions that he, 'let the issue be someone else's problem.' Snowden said that the culture of silence at the NSA was all-pervasive. Snowden testified, 'there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.' The NSA disputes this account, telling The Washington Post that, 'after extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.' 'Everyone in the intelligence community is aware of what happens to people who report concerns about unlawful but authorized operations,' he wrote. In the past, Snowden has mentioned that he tried to take four of his superiors to task over the spying program. 'I asked these people, ‘What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?' he said. 'How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?' Controversial: A float displaying giant likenesses of US President Barack Obama (L) and US Intelligence leaker Edward Snowden (R) makes its way during the traditional Rose Monday parade in Duesseldorf, western Germany. Snowden said that no one wanted to be associated with any complaints at the NSA. 'Even among the most senior individuals to whom I reported my concerns,” he continued, “no one at N.S.A. could ever recall an instance where an official complaint had resulted in an unlawful program being ended, but there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.' The Justice Department has charged Mr. Snowden with violating the Espionage Act and the fugitiver reiterated his claim that he has taken no documents with his to Russia. 'I didn’t take any documents with me from Hong Kong, and while I’m sure they were disappointed, it doesn’t take long for an intelligence service to realize when they’re out of luck,' he said. 'I would also add, for the record, that the United States government has repeatedly acknowledged that there is no evidence at all of any relationship between myself and the Russian intelligence service,' Mr. Snowden said. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, claims that he attempted to make formal complaints about government spy programs ten times before leaking information about them. Snowden alleges that as a contractor, rather than a government employee, he was not protected under whistleblower laws, nor protected from retaliation for revealing classified information. Snowden was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton, a private company, which placed him outside the protections granted to federal employees under Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 19. After being met with numerous warnings about the consequences of raising concerns about the NSA's spying programs, Snowden chose to leak information about the extent of the NSA's spying to the press and subsequently sought asylum in Russia. The NSA disputes Snowden's claims, stating that they have found no evidence to support his claim that he brought these matters to his supervisors' attention."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first post-Reconstruction era Republican elected to Congress from Florida was William C. Cramer in 1954 from Pinellas County on the Gulf Coast, where demographic changes were underway. In this period, African Americans were still disenfranchised by the state's constitution and discriminatory practices; in the 19th century they had made up most of the Republican Party. Cramer built a different Republican Party in Florida, attracting local white conservatives and transplants from northern and midwestern states. In 1966 Claude R. Kirk, Jr. was elected as the first post-Reconstruction Republican governor, in an upset election. In 1968 Edward J.

Q:Article: If you want to watch and know something about birds, you must find a good place near the bird nest . Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how to make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards . Don't make the boards too slippery . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to color the nest.

Article: In South Africa, the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes, resulting in mixed-race children. As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans, they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: Black, White, Asian (mostly Indian), and Coloured. The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European descent (with some Malay ancestry, especially in the Western Cape). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa. It imposed a system of legal racial segregation, a complex of laws known as apartheid. Now answer this question: What was a result of these marriages?","completion":"The result of the unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes during the period of colonization in South Africa was the creation of a mixed-race population. This mix of Bantu, Khoisan, European, and, in some cases, Malay ancestry contributed to the formation of a distinct racial group known as \\"Coloured.\\" The Coloured population occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White populations in South Africa. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaner-dominated government imposed a system of legal racial segregation, called apartheid, which classified the population under four main racial groups: Black, White, Asian (mostly Indian), and Coloured. The apartheid system aimed at dividing the population and maintaining white supremacy and control over the country's economy, resources, and political power. This classification system, along with the discriminatory laws and policies that it entailed, placed the Coloured group, as well as other non-white populations, into second-class status. As a consequence of these classifications and the apartheid system, the mixed-race Coloured population faced discrimination, social and economic marginalization, and limited political representation. This significantly impacted their access to education, housing, healthcare, and employment opportunities compared to their white counterparts. The apartheid system enforced racial segregation, including separate schools, neighborhoods, and public facilities, perpetuating racial divisions and disparities in South Africa. In summary, the result of the unions and marriages between European men and African women during the colonization period in South Africa led to the emergence of a mixed-race population classified as Coloured. This racial categorization, as well as the apartheid system, severely impacted the lives of the Coloured community, relegating them to second-class status and subjecting them to social, economic, and political discrimination and marginalization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Candy Movie plot: A poet named Dan (Heath Ledger) falls in love with an art student named Candy (Abbie Cornish) who gravitates to his bohemian lifestyle â and his love of heroin. Hooked as much on one another as they are on the drug, their relationship is alternating states of oblivion, self-destruction, and despair. The film is organized in 3 acts of roughly 3 scenes each, titled Heaven, Earth, and Hell: In Heaven, the young lovers ecstatically experience sex and drugs. Constantly seeking drug money, they borrow from Candy's parents or eccentric university professor Casper (Geoffrey Rush), selling things, stealing, even prostituting when desperate. In Earth they are married and confront the realities of addiction and family life. Dan purchases the drugs; Candy becomes a prostitute. Dan steals a credit card and gets the owner's PIN, then steals money from his bank funds. Candy becomes pregnant, and despite their efforts to \\"go clean\\", the baby is delivered stillborn at 23 weeks. They finally stop taking drugs with huge effort, going through agonizing withdrawal symptoms in the process. Despite poor living conditions, constant struggles for money, and frequent disputes, they love each other very much. In Hell they experience the dissolution of their relationship and recovery. They choose to move to the country to \\"try methadone\\" as a way to ease into a more normal life. After a disastrous Sunday lunch, Candy fights with her parents, breaks down, and screams at them to leave. Eventually, she becomes involved with a neighbor, a fellow drug user, and relapses to her previous lifestyle. She has a complete mental breakdown and becomes extremely distant toward Dan. He looks up Casper again, but he has died of a drug overdose; this forces Dan to reconsider his life. While Candy recovers in a clinic, Dan gets clean and gets a dishwashing job. When Candy returns to Dan, he says \\"There's no going back. If you're given a reprieve, I think it's good to remember just how thin it is\\" and she stands up and leaves.

However, given that it's mentioned as a \\"rug-hooking\\" get-together, it is reasonable to infer that the attendees engaged in the art of rug-hooking. Rug-hooking is a craft where rugs are made by pulling loops of yarn or fabric through a stiff woven base such as burlap, linen, or rug warp. The loops are pulled through the backing material by using a crochet-type hook mounted in a handle for leverage. This is a craft that has been popular in various cultures for centuries, often passed down from generation to generation, and often conducted in a social setting, much like quilting bees were in the past. So, at the get-together, the people would have likely gathered in a suitable space within the old house mentioned in the passage, a house described as one-third ancient log cabin and two-thirds epic add-on. Here, they would spread out their rug-hooking materials, which would include burlap, linen, or rug warp for the base; yarn or fabric for the loops, and the special hooking tool, and commence their rug-hooking. Participants would work on their individual projects, possibly sharing tips and techniques, trading yarn and fabric scraps, discussing designs, colors and patterns, or solving problems they have encountered with their projects. The host, the owner of the Irish Wolfhound dogs, might have shared stories of the dogs or allowed the guests to interact with them. As described, the dogs might have been laying around like speed bumps, adding a quaint charm to the environment. These types of get-togethers not only allow for work to be done on projects but also provide a social outlet for participants to talk, share, learn, and enjoy the companionship of like-minded people. The craft becomes a shared interest around which friends and acquaintances can bond, share a mutual love for creativity, and enjoy a pleasant social event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to find the answer to the question, we need to explore the Persian Empire's relationship with the northern India subcontinent further. Cyrus the Great's expedition marked the beginning of the Achaemenid Empire's control over the region. The Achaemenid Empire extended to cover parts of the northern India subcontinent, mainly through the actions of Darius I (also known as Darius the Great), who is said to have conquered the Punjab region around 518 BC. The Achaemenid Empire’s influence over the northern India subcontinent continued until the empire's eventual downfall in 330 BC when it was conquered by Alexander the Great. Alexander's conquest led to the end of the Achaemenid Empire and the beginning of the Hellenistic period. Based on this information, we can now determine how long the Persian empire controlled the northern India subcontinent. From the initial conquests during Cyrus the Great's reign in 530 BC to the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC, the Persian Empire's control lasted approximately 200 years. In conclusion, the given statement does not directly answer the question but provides context. To answer the question, we needed to explore the history of the Achaemenid Empire's control and determine that they ruled the northern India subcontinent for about 200 years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: How to Stay Safe and Healthy with Allergies: A Guide for Little Explorers Did you know that allergies are like little monsters in your body that can make you sneeze, itch, or feel not so good? Don't worry! We can outsmart those little monsters by following some easy rules. Let's learn how to keep ourselves safe and healthy when we have allergies. 1. Avoid your triggers Allergies happen because our body doesn't like something, and we call these things \\"triggers\\". Triggers can be things like pollen, dust, or animal fur. Imagine them like cooties that we have to avoid! To stay safe, we need to know what our triggers are and keep away from them as much as possible. 2. Use caution when preparing food Sometimes, allergies can come from the food we eat. To help keep the allergy monsters away, it's important to always wash our hands and clean our cooking areas. This helps make sure there isn't any leftover food that might cause an allergic reaction. 3. Cut down on dust in your home Dust is like a playground for allergy monsters! They love to hide and play there. To keep the monsters away, we can ask our grownups to help us clean our homes, toys, and bedding regularly. This helps make sure our home is a safe place to play and rest. 4. Control the movements of family pets Our furry friends like dogs and cats can accidentally bring in allergens, like pollen, on their fur. To help keep the allergy monsters away, we can ask our grownups to help us create a pet-free area in our home. This gives us a special place to play without worrying about allergies. 5. Avoid insect bites when spending time outside When playing outside, it's important to protect ourselves from bugs that can cause allergies, like bees, wasps, and mosquitoes. We can ask our grownups to help us put on bug spray, wear long sleeves, and avoid places where these bugs live, like flowers or standing water. 6. Inform all medical staff if you have a drug allergy Sometimes medicines can cause allergies, too. To stay safe, always tell your doctor and nurses if you're allergic to any medicines. They can give you other options to make you feel better without the allergy monsters coming to play. 7. Keep your EpiPen with you An EpiPen is like a superhero's tool to fight allergy monsters! If you know you have a very strong allergy, your doctor might give you an EpiPen. Always keep it with you, just like a superhero would, and ask your grownups to help you use it if you need to. 8. Take your medication as directed If your doctor gives you special medicine to help with allergies, be sure to take it exactly as they tell you to. This will help keep the allergy monsters from causing any trouble. 9. Get allergy shots Sometimes, we can train our body to fight the allergy monsters by getting shots called \\"allergy shots\\" or \\"immunotherapy\\". These shots help our body get used to the allergy triggers, so they won't bother us as much. Remember, allergies can be tricky, but by following these rules, we can keep those little monsters away and stay safe and healthy while having fun! Always ask your grownups for help and let them know how you're feeling if you think allergy monsters might be bothering you. Together, we can outsmart allergies!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands. - Scott David Radinsky (born March 3, 1968) is a left-handed former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball, who had an 11-year career from and .

The voice speaking the phrases was so soft, especially on the Spanish side, that we figured we got a broken one right out of the box. Franklin customer service promptly sent me a replacement, and I was shocked to see it has exactly the same problem -- even when the volume is turned up full you can barely hear the voice you are supposed to learn from.

During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable.

Question: Information: - The carrot (\\"Daucus carota\\" subsp. \\"sativus\\") is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow varieties exist. Carrots are a domesticated form of the wild carrot, \\"Daucus carota\\", native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot. - Silphium (also known as silphion, laserwort, or laser) was a plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning and as a medicine. It was the essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin (\\"laser\\", laserpicium, or lasarpicium). - Lovage, Levisticum officinale, is a tall perennial plant, the sole species in the genus Levisticum in the family Apiaceae, subfamily Apioideae, tribe Apieae. - Parsley or garden parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is a species of \\"Petroselinum\\" in the family Apiaceae, native to the central Mediterranean region (southern Italy, Greece, Algeria, and Tunisia), naturalized elsewhere in Europe, and widely cultivated as a herb, a spice, and a vegetable. - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Dill (\\"Anethum graveolens\\") is an annual herb in the celery family Apiaceae. - Caraway, also known as meridian fennel, and Persian cumin, (\\"Carum carvi\\") is a biennial plant in the family Apiaceae, native to western Asia, Europe, and North Africa. - Apium (including celery and the marshworts) is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with a subcosmopolitan distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia. They are medium to tall biennials or perennials growing up to 1 m high in the wet soil of marshes and salt marshes, and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels. Some species are edible, notably \\"Apium graveolens\\", which includes the commercially important vegetables celery, celeriac and Chinese celery. \\"Apium bermejoi\\" from the island of Minorca is one of the rarest plants in Europe, with fewer than 100 individuals left. - Centella asiatica, commonly known as centella, is a small, herbaceous, frost-tender perennial plant of the family Mackinlayaceae or subfamily Mackinlayoideae of family Apiaceae, and is native to wetlands in Asia. It is used as a medicinal herb in Ayurvedic medicine, traditional African medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine. It is also known as the Asiatic pennywort or Indian pennywort in English, among various other names in other languages. - Pastinaca ( parsnips ) is a genus of flowering plant in the Apiaceae , comprising 14 species . The economically most important member of the genus is Pastinaca sativa , the parsnip . - Chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium), sometimes called garden chervil to distinguish it from similar plants also called chervil, or French parsley, is a delicate annual herb related to parsley. It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture fines herbes. - Celery (\\"Apium graveolens\\"), a marshland plant in the family Apiaceae, has been cultivated as a vegetable since antiquity. Celery has a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves. Depending on location and cultivar, either its stalks, leaves, or hypocotyl are eaten and used in cooking. - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm. - Asafoetida is the dried latex (gum oleoresin) exuded from the rhizome or tap root of several species of \\"Ferula\\", a perennial herb that grows tall. The species is native to the deserts of Iran and mountains of Afghanistan and is mainly cultivated in nearby India. As its name suggests, asafoetida has a fetid smell, but in cooked dishes, it delivers a smooth flavour reminiscent of leeks. - Anise ('), also called aniseed\\"', is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia. Its flavor has similarities with some other spices, such as star anise, fennel, and licorice. - Cicely or sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata) is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the celery family Apiaceae. It is one of two accepted species in the genus Myrrhis. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - Endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants following fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in the human diet. For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source of sugars for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut \\"meat\\" and coconut \\"water\\", and corn. Some plants, such as orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The parsnip (\\"Pastinaca sativa\\") is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged. - Apiaceae or Umbelliferae, is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants commonly known as the celery, carrot or parsley family. The family, which is named after the type genus \\"Apium\\", is large, with more than 3,700 species spread across 434 genera; it is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants. Included in this family are the well-known plants: angelica, anise, arracacha, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, \\"Centella asiatica\\", chervil, cicely, coriander (cilantro), culantro, cumin, dill, fennel, hemlock, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip, cow parsnip, sea holly, giant hogweed and silphium (a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct). - Fennel (\\"Foeniculum vulgare\\") is a flowering plant species in the carrot family. It is a hardy, perennial herb with yellow flowers and feathery leaves. It is indigenous to the shores of the Mediterranean but has become widely naturalized in many parts of the world, especially on dry soils near the sea-coast and on riverbanks. - The gymnosperms are a group of seed-producing plants that includes conifers, cycads, \\"Ginkgo\\", and gnetophytes. The term \\"gymnosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word \\"\\" ( gymnos, \\"naked\\" and sperma, \\"seed\\"), meaning \\"naked seeds\\", after the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). Their naked condition stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, often modified to form cones, or at the end of short stalks as in \\"Ginkgo\\". - Angelica is a genus of about 60 species of tall biennial and perennial herbs in the family Apiaceae, native to temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, reaching as far north as Iceland and Lapland and Greenland. They grow to tall, with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels of white or greenish-white flowers. - Coriander (or ; \\"Coriandrum sativum\\"), also known as cilantro or Chinese parsley, is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae. All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most traditionally used in cooking.

Mary Chapin Carpenter (born February 21, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter. Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Carpenter was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to Chapin Carpenter Jr., a Life Magazine executive, and Mary Bowie Robertson. Carpenter lived in Japan from 1969 to 1971 before moving to Washington, D.C. She attended Princeton Day School, a private coeducational prep school, before graduating from The Taft School in 1976. Carpenter described her childhood as \\"pretty typical suburban\\", with her musical interests defined chiefly by her sisters' albums of artists such as The Mamas & the Papas, The Beatles, and Judy Collins. When Carpenter was 16 her parents divorced, an event that affected Carpenter and that she wrote about in her song \\"House of Cards\\". Carpenter spent much of her time in high school playing the guitar and piano; while at Princeton Day School, her \\"classmates threatened to cut her guitar strings if she played 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' one more time.\\" Despite her interest in music, Carpenter never considered performing publicly until, shortly after graduating from Taft, her father suggested that she perform at a local open-mic bar, a stressful experience for the shy Carpenter, who recalled, \\"I thought I was going to barf.\\" Carpenter also hosted an open-mic night at a bar in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, DC for a number of years. Carpenter graduated from Brown University in 1981 with a degree in American Civilization. Carpenter played some summer sets in Washington's music scene, where she met guitarist John Jennings, who would become her producer and long-time collaborator. However, she considered music a hobby and planned on getting a \\"real job\\". She briefly quit performing, but after several job interviews decided to return to music.

Milady brings the Cardinal information regarding the notorious affair between the queen of France and the English Duke of Buckingham. Outside their window, the queen's seamstress, Constance Bonacieux, stands watching the conversation between the two characters, when she is attacked by Rochefort, one of the Cardinal's loyal men. She is rescued by the young musketeer d'Artagnan and taken away to his abode, where Constance briefly explains her troubles and asks for d'Artagnan's help. Cardinal Richelieu, wanting to convince King Louis XIII that his wife, the queen, is unfaithful to him and in love with the Duke of Buckingham, suggests that he should ask his wife to wear the diamonds he had given her for an upcoming ball. The queen, shocked and dismayed, confesses to Constance that she had sent the diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham, and her confidant goes to d'Artagnan for help. With the help of his companions, three of the finest musketeers in France, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, d'Artagnan makes his way to England to seek the Duke himself, so that he may recover the diamonds and restore the queen's honor. Still, when all problems seem overcome, the English Duke of Buckingham plans to invade France, remove King Louis XIII and marry the queen; on the other hand, Cardinal Richelieu and Milady want revenge on d'Artagnan and Buckingham.

Please answer the following question: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece.

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Centastage helping playwrights find their voice, audience Twenty-five years ago, Boston playwrights had few outlets for their work. And yet, says playwright, director, and teacher Joe Antoun, a lot of people were writing plays. So Antoun and John Schumacher launched Centastage, a theater company dedicated exclusively to producing world premieres of plays by New England writers. The company’s latest production is “Academy Fight Song,” by Andrew Clarke, which runs Sept. 10-26 in the Calderwood Pavilion. “Once the word got out about our mission, we had 50-60 scripts sent to us every year,” says Antoun, who serves as artistic director while Schumacher is executive director. The company produced two or three plays each season, sometimes grouping short works together, such as “The Xmas Files” (holiday-themed plays) and “Boston Sings Boston” (cabarets of new songs by local songwriters. Centastage also co-produced the Women on Top Festival with Underground Railway Theater for six years, showcasing new work by women. Award-winning playwright Melinda Lopez, whose first full-length play, “The Order of Things,” was produced by Centastage in 2000, calls Antoun “a tireless champion of interesting, challenging, quirky new voices.” “Joe saw a very early draft of the play, which was about quantum physics and cancer and Cuba,” Lopez says, “and he thought that was a perfectly natural subject.” With Antoun’s help, the play went on to win the Kennedy Center Fund for New Plays award. “It was the first time I realized maybe there is something to this new play thing,” Lopez says. “Maybe a person can write plays for a living.” While Antoun says he focuses on the script, Lopez and others say he often sees something in writers at a critical early phase of their career. “Centastage produced ‘Emerald City,’ one of my first plays, in 2001,” says award-winning playwright John Kuntz. “Emerald City” was a very loose adaptation of “The Wizard of Oz” that included a first-act climax with the cast dancing to “Downtown” by Petula Clark. “It was a wacky, ambitious play,” says Kuntz. “I’m not sure who would have produced it besides Joe. I didn’t know I could write a play like that at the time, so it was a very important moment for me as a playwright.” Antoun also provided a platform for artists new to the Boston theater scene, including the Gold Dust Orphans’ first production of “How Mrs. Grinchley Nearly Swiped Christmas” in 1999. “Joe was always very kind to me,” says award-winning playwright Ryan Landry. “We were quite the demanding ladies back in those days, and we might have driven him a bit crazy, but he encouraged us, which was so important then.” After several years of producing a regular season of plays, including “Heart of Jade” by Gip Hoppe, “More Than What” by Janet Kenney, “Boy X Man” by Ed Bullins, and “Dancing Downstream” by Bill Lattanzi, Centastage stepped away from mounting full seasons. “We felt we weren’t serving the playwrights,” says Antoun. “Selecting the plays began to feel like a contest, and sometimes we were pushing plays out there too early.” Centastage shifted its energies into play development, launching Write On!, a writing group for playwrights, hosting a Dark Night series of play readings, and producing plays only when Antoun felt they were ready, which now means once every couple of years. “That approach allows us to latch onto a script, either through the writing group or in the staged readings, and then we can work together on it,” Antoun says. “That’s how we found ‘Fakus’ [by Joe Byers, which Centastage produced in 2013] and ‘Academy Fight Song.’ ” “Academy Fight Song” follows a college professor who agrees to appear at an academic conference with a former student who has become a literary star, in the hopes of receiving job security. His appearance, however, goes horribly wrong, and trouble ensues. Clarke says he’s worked with Antoun on the script on and off for the past five years, but he’s known him for nearly 20 years, as they both teach playwriting at Emerson College. “I trust Joe’s instincts,” says Clarke. “Besides, he knows exactly who to cast, and I’m always amazed at what actors bring to the table.” “The plays that appeal to me have a strong voice,” says Antoun. “I’m glad we’ve been able to help some writers get their work onstage, but I’d be just as happy to see other theaters in other cities produce these plays.” At Nicholas Martin Hall, Calderwood Pavillion, Boston Center for the Arts, What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Hypothesis: One of the new opportunities gained from this piece of legislation is the ability to purchase ice cream from the cafeteria.","completion":"The given context does not provide any information or evidence that could lead to your proposed hypothesis. There is nothing mentioned in the details that stipulates one of these new opportunities as being the ability to purchase ice cream from the cafeteria. From the context, the primary anticipation and expectation surrounding the new legislation appear to be the potential for greater freedom from the bureaucracy and red tape of Ottawa, implying that there might be regulatory, procedural, operational or even legislative hindrances that have previously affected some individuals or entities, reducing their efficiency, progress or general ease of operations. The given context implies that these hindrances have somehow hampered the freedom of these entities or individuals, and the expectation is for more streamlined operations, functions or activities - a comparative ease compared to the status quo, in the wake of the legislation. However, it does not draw any direct or indirect references to ice cream, cafeterias, or related industries, processes or outcomes. Contextual interpretations, therefore, should generally be drawn logically, based on the information explicitly provided or implicit. One can delve into potential outcomes of greater freedom from red tape – like the potential for streamlined operations, enhanced efficiency, lower costs and service delays, perhaps even increased innovation due to less bureaucracy. However, it's important to stick to the information provided, making reasonable and verifiable conclusions. The hypothesis about the ability to purchase ice cream from the cafeteria, unfortunately, lacks the necessary contextual grounding and support to be a valid presumption from the given context.

The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past.

Nintendo Entertainment System: To differentiate Nintendo's new home platform from the early 1980s' common perception of a troubled and shallow video game market, the company freshened its product nomenclature and positioning, and it established a strict product approval and licensing policy. The overall system was referred to as an \\"Entertainment System\\" instead of a \\"video game system\\", which was centered upon a machine called a \\"Control Deck\\" instead of a \\"console\\", and which featured software cartridges called \\"Game Paks\\" instead of \\"video games\\". The 10NES lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck, deterring the copying or production of NES games which had not first achieved Nintendo's licensed approval. The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bore pictures of a very close representation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game, which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own. Symbols on the launch games' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game, in order to reduce consumer confusion. A 'seal of quality' was printed on all appropriately licensed game and accessory packaging. The initial seal stated, \\"This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product\\". This text was later changed to \\"Official Nintendo Seal of Quality\\". Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What will man be like in the future --- in 5,000 or even 50,000 years from now? We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, because man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average , men are about three inches taller. 500 years is relatively a short period of time, so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modern world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still use only about 20% of the brain's capacity . As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and finally we shall need our brains more and more, and finally we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring a physical change too. The head, especially the forehead , will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are used too much. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a long time it is possible that man's eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we make use of our arms and legs less. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a lot in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both men and women are likely to be hairless. Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive person to look at! This may be true.However, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a person, with thoughts and feelings similar to our own. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about man in the future?

(Associated Press) France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius speaks during a press meeting at the Quai d' Orsay, in Paris, Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2013. Fabuis said France will float a resolution in the U.N. Security Council... (Associated Press) The surprise Russian proposal, which Syria and the United States both accepted, would put President Bashar Assad's regime's chemical stockpile under international control before its eventual dismantling. The initiative _ also cautiously endorsed by Britain and France _ appeared to offer a way out of a crisis that raised the prospect of U.S.-led military action against Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack last month. But the plan ran aground as the world powers haggled over the crucial element of how to enforce it. Wary of falling into what the French foreign minister called \\"a trap,\\" Paris and Washington are pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution to verify Syria's disarmament. Russia, a close Assad ally and the regime's chief patron on the international stage, dismissed France's proposal as unacceptable. The dizzying diplomatic maneuvering threatened what had been growing momentum toward a plan that would allow President Barack Obama to back away from military action. Domestic support for a strike is uncertain in the United States, even as Obama seeks Congress' backing for action _ and there has been little international appetite to join forces against Assad. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said early Tuesday during a trip to Moscow that Damascus \\"agreed to the Russian initiative as it should thwart the U.S. aggression against our country.\\" Before departing Moscow in the evening, al-Moallem told Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV that Syria would place its chemical weapons locations in the hands of representatives of Russia, other unspecified countries and the United Nations. Syria will also declare the chemical arsenal it long denied having, stop producing such weapons and sign conventions against them. Mindful that Damascus could only be seeking to avoid Western military strikes, France said it would put forward a draft resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, making it enforceable with military action. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the French resolution would demand that Syria open its chemical weapons program to inspection, place it under international control, and ultimately dismantle it. A violation of that commitment, he said, would carry \\"very serious consequences.\\" The resolution would condemn the Aug. 21 attack and bring those responsible to justice, he said. \\"We do not want this to be used as a diversion,\\" Fabius said. \\"It is by accepting these precise conditions that we will judge the credibility of the intentions expressed yesterday.\\" Obama threw his support behind the French resolution and discussed the matter with French President Francois Hollande and British Prime Minister David Cameron. At the same time, he continued to push his original plan to win congressional authorization for U.S. airstrikes against Assad's regime in case the diplomatic efforts fail. Obama was to address the nation from the White House on Tuesday night. The prospect of a deal that could be enforced militarily met swift opposition from Russia, which has provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Assad throughout the 2 1/2-year conflict. President Vladimir Putin said the plan can only work if \\"the American side and those who support the U.S.A, in this sense, reject the use of force.\\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told his French counterpart that it is unacceptable for the resolution to cite Chapter 7, the U.N. resolution authorizing force, his ministry said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in turn, said the U.S. rejects a Russian suggestion that the U.N. endorsement come in the form of a non-binding statement from the Security Council president. The U.S. has to have a full resolution _ one that entails \\"consequences if games are played and somebody tries to undermine this,\\" he said. Obama is sending Kerry to Geneva to discuss the issue with Russia's foreign minister, a State Department official said. The two are to meet Thursday. The official was not authorized to discuss the mission publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in statement that Lavrov and Kerry spoke by telephone and the two \\"agreed to continue contacts, including the possibility of holding a personal meeting in the coming days.\\" The U.S. and its allies have insisted Assad must be punished for last month's chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. The Obama administration, France and others blame the regime, but Damascus says rebels _ not its forces _ were behind the attack. The U.S. has said more than 1,400 Syrians died; even conservative estimates from international organizations put the toll at several hundred. Obama, who was to deliver a national address on Syria later Tuesday, cautiously welcomed the initial Russian proposal. But he said the U.S. is still prepared to go ahead with strikes if it falls through. \\"The key is, to paraphrase Ronald Reagan, that we don't just trust, but we also verify,\\" Obama told CBS on Monday. \\"The importance is to make sure that the international community has confidence that these chemical weapons are under control, that they are not being used, that potentially they are removed from Syria and that they are destroyed.\\" Obama said the idea had been broached in his 20-minute meeting with Putin last week on the sidelines of an economic summit in St. Petersburg, Russia. Obama said he directed Kerry to have more conversations with the Russians and \\"run this to ground.\\" What has been left unaddressed in the flurry of diplomacy is the broader civil war in Syria, a conflict that has already claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people and forced more than 6 million Syrians _ nearly a third of the population _ to flee their homes. The Syrian National Coalition, the main Western-backed opposition group, dismissed the Assad government's turnaround as a maneuver to escape punishment for what it called a crime against humanity. The coalition had been hoping for military strikes from abroad to tip the balance in the war of attrition between rebels and Assad's forces. In a statement Tuesday, the Coalition said Moscow's proposal \\"aims to procrastinate and will lead to more death and destruction of the Syrian people.\\" \\"Crimes against humanity cannot be dropped by giving political concessions or by handing over the weapons used in these crimes,\\" the group said. The plan would allow Assad to avoid the damage that U.S.-led strikes, no matter how narrow and limited, would likely inflict on a Syrian military already stretched thin and under tremendous strain from the civil war. While Assad would be forced to relinquish his chemical arms stockpile, doing so is unlikely to deal a devastating blow to his war machine. Nor is it likely to stanch the bloodshed. The U.S. and the Syrian opposition accuse the regime of using such weapons on several occasions, but the casualties from those attacks have been a mere fraction of the total death toll from the conflict. \\"What does it change if you take the chemical weapons from Bashar Assad? Does it stop the real danger?\\" asked Loay al-Mikdad, a spokesman for the Western-backed Free Syrian Army. \\"He's not just killing us with chemical weapons. Bashar Assad is killing us with all of his weapons, by all his forces.\\" ___ Hinnant reported from Paris.

The surprise Russian proposal, which Syria and the United States both accepted, would put President Bashar Assad's regime's chemical stockpile under international control before its eventual dismantling. The initiative was also cautiously endorsed by Britain and France, and it appeared to offer a way out of a crisis that raised the prospect of U.S.-led military action against Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack last month. The plan, however, stalled as the world powers haggled over the crucial element of how to enforce it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information: - Austrofascism was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934, which ceased with the annexation of the newly founded Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement. - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892 July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938. - The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded from 1861, when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy, to 1946, when a constitutional referendum led civil discontent to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state. - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\". - Italian Fascism, also known simply as Fascism, is the original fascist ideology, as developed in Italy. The ideology is associated with the National Fascist Party, which under Benito Mussolini ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, the Republican Fascist Party that ruled the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945, the post-war Italian Social Movement and subsequent Italian neo-fascist movements. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional leftright spectrum. - The National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\", PNF) was an Italian political party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as \\"Fasci\\"). The party ruled Italy from 1922 when Fascists took power with the March on Rome, to 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism. - Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (29 July 1883 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\"; PNF), ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as \\"Il Duce\\" (The Leader), Mussolini was the founder of Italian Fascism. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897 18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - The Italian Social Republic, informally known as the Republic of Salò, was a state with limited recognition that was created during the later part of World War II (in existence from 1943 until 1945). Mussolini had originally intended to call his new republic the Italian Socialist Republic. It was the second and last incarnation of the Fascist Italian state and was led by Duce Benito Mussolini and his reformed Republican Fascist Party. The state declared Rome as its capital, but was \\"de facto\\" centered on Salò (hence its colloquial name), a small town on Lake Garda, near Brescia, where Mussolini and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was headquartered. The RSI exercised nominal sovereignty in northern and central Italy, but was largely dependent on German troops to maintain control. - The Republican Fascist Party (PFR) was a political party led by Benito Mussolini during the German occupation of Central and Northern Italy. It was founded as the successor of former National Fascist Party as an anti-monarchist party. It considered King Victor Emmanuel III to be a traitor after he had signed the surrender to the Allied powers. - The Fatherland Front ( German : Vaterländische Front , VF ) was the ruling political organisation of \`\` Austrofascism '' . It claimed to be a nonpartisan movement , and aimed to unite all the people of Austria , overcoming political and social divisions . Established on 20 May 1933 by Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss as a one - party along the lines of Italian Fascism , it advocated Austrian nationalism and independence from Nazi Germany on the basis of protecting Austria 's Catholic religious identity from what they considered a Protestant - dominated German state . The Fatherland Front which was strongly linked with Austria 's Catholic clergy , absorbed Dollfuss 's Christian Social Party , the agrarian Landbund and the right - wing paramilitary Heimwehren , all of which were opposed to socialism , free - market capitalism and liberal democracy . It established an authoritarian and corporatist regime , the Federal State of Austria , which is commonly known in German as the Ständestaat ( \`\` corporate state '' ) . According to the Fatherland Front , this form of government and society implemented the social teaching of Pope Pius XI 's 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno . The Front banned and persecuted all its political opponents , including Communists , Social Democrats -- who fought against it in a brief Civil War in February 1934 -- but also the Austrian Nazis who wanted Austria to join Hitler 's Greater German Empire . Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazis in July 1934 . He was succeeded as leader of the VF and Chancellor of Austria by Kurt Schuschnigg , who ruled until the invigorated Nazis forced him to resign on 11 March 1938 . Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany the next day .

Given the question: Given the following context: In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force. They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham? The answer is:","completion":"Ethan Ethan Allen was the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham during the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. Allen was one of the leaders of the Patriot forces, which included the Green Mountain Boys, militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut. Together with Benedict Arnold, they managed to surprise the small British garrison stationed at the fort, which led to its capture and the acquisition of cannons and armaments essential for the Patriots in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The letterhead on correspondence still bears the Bexar County Legal Aid name, even though the organization is no longer. Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said. Question: \\"What are the functions of Hall's firms in the Rio Grand Valley?\\" Answer: \\"Assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation, assist migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation, as well as to operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many haikus are inspired by objects in the natural world, such as trees, rocks, mountains, and flowers. To get ideas for your poem, take a walk in a park nearby or go for a hike in the woods. Can we infer the following? Haikus are often inspired by the Earth.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that haikus are often inspired by the Earth, particularly by elements found in nature. Haikus are a form of traditional Japanese poetry that typically focus on the natural world, its beauty, and its transient nature. This deep connection to the environment and ecosystem is a hallmark of haiku poetry. When writing a haiku poem, there are certain steps and guidelines you can follow to create a piece that embraces this rich poetic tradition. 1. Familiarize yourself with the structure: Haikus typically follow a 5-7-5 syllable pattern across three lines. The first line contains 5 syllables, the second line has 7 syllables, and the third line has 5 syllables. It's essential to adhere to this format when composing a traditional haiku. 2. Choose a subject from nature: As mentioned earlier, most haikus are inspired by the natural world. Use a scene or image from nature as the primary focus of your poem. An aspect of the changing seasons, the behavior of an animal, or the characteristics of a plant or landscape are all suitable subjects. 3. Employ sensory details: A successful haiku creates a vivid, sensory experience for the reader. To achieve this, use concrete, descriptive words that evoke the scene you're trying to depict. Focus on the sights, sounds, smells, and textures that the scene or object presents. 4. Emphasize the present moment: Haikus often capture a brief, in-the-moment experience, creating a sense of immediacy. As you write your poem, focus on a single moment and strive to express it with clarity and simplicity. 5. Incorporate a sense of contrast or surprise: A key aspect of haiku is the juxtaposition of two contrasting images or ideas, which often creates a sense of surprise or revelation for the reader. This technique, known as \\"cutting,\\" can be achieved through the use of punctuation or by positioning the contrasting elements on separate lines. 6. Embrace simplicity: Haikus are characterized by their simplicity and brevity. Avoid using flowery language or overly complicated expressions. Instead, aim for clarity and conciseness when expressing your ideas. 7. Practice and revise: As with any form of writing, practice is essential. Write multiple drafts of your haiku to refine your language, imagery, and structure. Share your work with others for feedback and take the time to edit and revise your poem until you're satisfied with the final result. With these guidelines and an appreciation for the beauty of the natural world, you'll be well on your way to crafting a haiku poem that captures the essence of the Earth and its myriad wonders."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chris Pearce, a Getty photographer who happened to be there, initially thought the yacht's crew were attempting to drop someone off. But he heard a child and an adult on board exclaiming, \\"Come help, come help,\\" as their boat rapidly filled with water. At this crucial moment, members of the nudist community sprung into action, wading in to lend a hand. A woman and a child were rescued and, with the help of the bare-skinned heroes, the boat was successfully pulled ashore. This amusing and unconventional rescue played out with a backdrop of amused onlookers and bystanders. Pearce explained, \\"Everyone basically just stopped and watched and looked as this happened.\\" He added that many people initially found the whole scene comical due to its unique setting, but quickly became serious as the rescue unfolded. The incident lasted around five minutes, during which a few hundred people watched the heroic efforts of the nude rescuers. One of the men aboard the sinking yacht was seen grinning as the naked helpers surrounded the boat, demonstrating the light-hearted and extraordinary nature of this unusual maritime rescue. Thus, a potential disaster was averted all thanks to the quick-thinking nudist community and their unhesitating willingness to help fellow humans in need, providing both a memorable moment for all who experienced it and, above all, a celebration of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: Needs Improvement - An Underwhelming and Confusing Experience I recently downloaded the app \\"org.sufficientlysecure.keychain\\" after hearing about its potential in managing my encryption keys in a secure and efficient manner. To be fair, the idea behind the app is commendable, and I appreciate the developers' intentions to provide a tool to help users maintain their privacy and protect their data. However, I must say that my experience with the app was underwhelming and often caused confusion due to its subpar interface and lack of proper guidance. I am giving it 2-stars because I believe there is some potential, but there is substantial room for improvement. Firstly, the user interface of the app is rather outdated and not very intuitive. It took me quite a while to figure out how to navigate and perform basic tasks. New users like myself may find it difficult to understand how the app functions and locate essential features such as creating, importing, or managing keys. Moreover, there's a lack of helpful prompts or tooltips to guide a user. A more streamlined design would significantly improve the usability and overall experience. Secondly, the absence of a comprehensive user manual or tutorial leaves a lot to be desired. For an app that deals with encryption and key management, it is essential to have proper guidance to ensure users, especially those who are new to encryption, can learn to use the app effectively and leverage its full capabilities. In its current state, the app does not provide enough information to assist users in understanding how to use it or provide examples of real-life use cases. Additionally, I encountered multiple bugs and crashes while using the app, which further diminished my confidence in its reliability. There were instances when the app would freeze or crash, requiring me to restart it repeatedly. Furthermore, there were occasions when the app failed to import some of my keys or to properly encrypt or decrypt messages. A more robust error handling system should be implemented to improve the app's reliability and ensure users' satisfaction. Despite my negative experience, I must say that the app's developers have the right idea in creating a tool to manage encryption keys securely. With some improvements in the user interface, the addition of a comprehensive tutorial or manual, better handling of errors, and addressing the reported bugs, I believe the app could become an indispensable tool. In conclusion, I can only give the \\"org.sufficientlysecure.keychain\\" app a 2-star rating. I hope that the developers will take my feedback into consideration and improve the app in future updates. With proper attention and enhancements, the app has the potential to become a reliable and useful tool for secure key management and end-to-end encryption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

This year, I've done 163,581 miles of it. I love that when you fly a lot, the airport social media staff say 'hello' on Twitter when you arrive and the cabin crew on your home route (or even on the Brisbane-Dubai non-stop route) recognise you from last time. I like getting great service, and see so many things about systems-thinking that work well in airlines, that I'm happy to forgive small indiscrepancies when they occur. All that said, flying strangles our planet as much as eating too much red meat, and for many, many reasons, I've wanted to stop flying quite so much, while not restricting the spread and growth of the ideas from our firm, NoTosh. I'm quite sure that nobody reading this blog really cares about how much I travel, but keeping an annual count on it has become a new year habit. When I started working at Channel 4, and then continuing when I created NoTosh, I wanted to keep track of what seemed like an interminable number of miles on the road and in the air. By 2012, 2013 and last year, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever be able to get the number of miles down when they seemed to represent even more trips to the moon and back each and every year. When you run a company based in Edinburgh with a great team living in Melbourne, you could easily spend your life on a plane - one flying to Melbourne feels better than two or more flying to Edinburgh. Indeed, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 it felt like I really did spend my life on a plane, as I went to the moon and back in my annual travel, with anything up to seven trips a year to Australia. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does the author feel about flying to Melbourne?

Later that evening, second vice president Keyser, upon the request of the strikers, addressed a workingmen's meeting at Cross Street Market Hall, and presented the company's written response reprinted in the papers for the public. The letter, signed by both King and Keyser, stated the company's position as follows: the company would not negotiate on the matter of the 10 percent wage reduction, but it would \\"be pleased to address itself to the investigation of any of the minor grievances of which the men complained\\". The Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported a general hope that, owing to the imminent increase in traffic due to the transport of harvested crops, the firemen would be able to make daily round trips, thus avoiding layovers, and that the company could arrange for them to return home on passenger trains when this was not feasible.Keyser's reprinted response advised that the ten percent cut was \\"forced upon the company\\", but that he was confident they would be able to provide more full employment, and thus increase wages, due to an abundance of freight to be moved. He said that a system of passes would be arranged to address the issue of idle time caused by delays. He entreated the men that if the situation could not be resolved, it must \\"bring want and suffering upon all; suffering from which you and your families cannot hope to be exempt.\\" He asserted that, although 90 percent of rail workers had accepted the reduction, the whole business of the railroad and city had been halted due to the 10 percent rejecting them, and resolving to not allow the rest of the men to continue work.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance? ? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge .

The idea of a 75-year-old man traveling the country-side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than \\"The Straight Story.\\" The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl. She's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago. He had them each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them. \\"That bundle,\\" he said, \\"is family.\\" So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger. \\"The Straight Story\\" realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions. Alvin's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un-Hollywood character interactions. Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey. It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets--to their benefit and ours.

My sister and two brothers had the same mean mother as I did. My mother insisted upon knowing where we were at all times. She had to know who our friends were and where we were going.

We had to wear clean clothes and take a bath every day. The other kids always wore their clothes for days. We reached the height of disgrace because she made our clothes herself, just to save money. I believe she laid awake at night thinking up mean things to do to us. Through the years, things didn't improve a bit. We could not lie in bed \\"sick\\" like our friends did, and miss school.

Poor Geri was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first gaffe. Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet c1ients casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools.

Gabrielle Giffords among the wounded and a federal judge among the six dead, police said. The dead in the shooting outside a Tucson grocery included U.S. District Judge John Rolf, Gabe Zimmerman, a Giffords aide, and a 9-year-old girl who died at a Tucson hospital from her injuries, CNN reported. The Pima County Sheriff's Office said six people were killed and 13 wounded. Giffords, D-Ariz.,was shot in the head at close range and was still in critical condition at 6 p.m. Saturday. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, at a news conference in Tucson, identified the suspect as Jared Lee Loughner, 22, of Tucson. Dupnik also said police were searching for a \\"person of interest\\" who may have driven Loughner to the scene and aided him in other ways. The Arizona Republic reported Loughner posted a number of disturbing messages on his MySpace account and on YouTube. A few hours before the shooting outside a Tucson grocery, he posted a farewell on MySpace: \\"Goodbye. Dear friends . . . Please don't be mad at me.\\" One posting on YouTube said \\"Don't trust the current government, listener.\\" The White House was monitoring the situation, and FBI agents have been dispatched to the scene, CNN reported. Giffords was holding an event outside a Safeway supermarket when the shooting started. The congresswoman had previous brushes with violence. Her office was vandalized in March after she voted for the Obama healthcare plan, shots were fired at an Arizona office during the 2008 campaign and an armed protester was removed by police from a 2009 event. Meanwhile, in Washington, Capitol Police released a statement advising all members of Congress to take \\"prudent precautions\\" for their personal security. Related UPI Stories ||||| U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head Saturday when an assailant opened fire outside a grocery store during a meeting with constituents, killing at least five people and wounding several others in a rampage that rattled the nation.

Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., Saturday, Jan. 8, 2011, at a Safeway grocery store in Tucson, Ariz. (AP Photo/Chris... (Associated Press) Giffords was among at least 10 people wounded, and the hospital said her outlook was \\"optimistic\\" and that she was responding to commands from doctors. The hospital said a 9-year-old child was among those killed, and a U.S. Marshal said a federal judge was also fatally shot in the attack. Giffords spokesman C.J. Karamargin said an unspecified number of her staff members were injured in the shooting. Congressional officials said an aide to Giffords was killed, and President Barack Obama said five people died in all. Police say the shooter was in custody, and was identified by people familiar with the investigation as Jared Loughner, 22. Pima County Sheriff's officials said he used a pistol to carry out the shooting spree. U.S. officials who provided his name to the AP spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release it publicly. The shooting prompted an outpouring of sympathy from politicians and people around the country. Obama called the shooting \\"an unspeakable tragedy\\" and that such \\"a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society.\\" Obama sent his FBI director to oversee the investigation. \\"It's not surprising that today Gabby was doing what she always does, listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors,\\" Obama said in a nationally televised news conference. \\"That is the essence of what our democracy is about.\\" Federal law enforcement officials were poring over captured versions of a MySpace page that belonged to Jared Loughner and over Youtube video published to the Internet weeks ago under an account \\"Classitup10\\" and linked to him. The MySpace page, which was removed within minutes of the gunman being identified by U.S. officials, included a mysterious \\"Goodbye friends\\" message published hours before the shooting which exhorted his friends to \\"Please don't be mad at me.\\" In one of several Youtube videos, which featured text against a dark background, Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords' congressional district in Arizona. Two spellings of his last name were given in the aftermath of the shooting _ Loughner and Laughner. \\"I know who's listening: Government Officials, and the People,\\" Loughner wrote. \\"Nearly all the people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency, aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn't have happen (sic).\\" Three hours after the shooting, the L-shaped shopping center in Tucson was blocked off by police and had fire trucks and other vehicles in its parking lot that blocked the view of the store's front door. No shell casings could be seen from the area 500 yards (460 meters) from the store where reporters and photographers were kept. Outside Giffords' office on Capitol Hill, a handful of congressional staffers could be seen walking into her office without comment, some with roller bags and one who was in tears. About a half dozen yellow flowers, placed by one mourner, sat outside the door. U.S. Marshal for Arizona David Gonzales confirmed to the Associated Press that U.S. District Judge John Roll also died in the attack. Giffords, 40, was re-elected to her third term last November. She was a member of the Arizona House and Senate before coming to Washington. Giffords tweeted shortly before the shooting, describing her \\"Congress on Your Corner\\" event: \\"My 1st Congress on Your Corner starts now. Please stop by to let me know what is on your mind or tweet me later.\\" Giffords is married to astronaut Mark E. Kelly, who has piloted space shuttles Endeavour and Discovery. The two met in China in 2003 while they were serving on a committee there, and were married in January 2007. In a statement of condolence, Sen. Bill Nelson, chairman of the Senate Commerce Space and Science Subcommittee, said her husband is training to be the commander of the next space shuttle mission slated for April. His astronaut brother is currently serving aboard the International Space Station, he said. Giffords was first elected to Congress amid a wave of Democratic victories in the 2006 election, and she won a narrow victory against a favorite of the ultraconservative tea party movement in the 2010 election. She has been mentioned as a possible Democratic nominee in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Jon Kyl, who has not said whether he'll run again, or for the governor's office in 2014. The shooting comes amid a highly charged political environment that has seen several dangerous threats against lawmakers but nothing that reached the point of actual violence. A San Francisco man upset with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's support of health care reform pleaded guilty to threatening the Democratic congresswoman and her family, calling her directly on March 25 and threatening to destroy her Northern California home if she voted for health care reform. In July, a California man known for his anger over left-leaning politics engaged in a shootout with highway patrol officers after planning an attack on the American Civil Liberties Union and another nonprofit group. The man said he wanted to \\"start a revolution\\" by killing people at the ACLU and the Tides Foundation. Giffords herself has drawn the ire of the right, especially for her support of Obama's health care reform bill from politicians like Sarah Palin. Her Tucson office was vandalized a few hours after the House vote to approve the health care law in March, with someone either kicking or shooting out a glass door and window. In an interview after the vandalism, Giffords referred to the animosity against her by conservatives. Palin listed Giffords' seat as one of the top \\"targets\\" in the November elections because of the lawmakers' support for the health care law. \\"For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they have to realize that there are consequences to that action,\\" Giffords said in an interview with MSNBC. In the hours after the shooting, Palin issued a statement in which she expressed her \\"sincere condolences\\" to the family of Giffords and the other victims. Capitol police responded to the shooting by advising lawmakers and their staff to \\"take reasonable and prudent precautions regarding their personal security.\\" Despite her clashes with the right, Giffords describes herself as a former Republican and current Blue Dog Democrat. The Blue Dogs are moderate centrist Democrats. \\"You know, actually as a former Republican, you know, I consider myself someone who is pretty in the middle, I'm a blue dog Democrat, and one that is interested in making sure that our country maintains our prosperity and frankly, our superiority over other countries and that's where we look at these threat, obviously our defense budget, our level of education,\\" she said in an interview with Fox News earlier this week. ___ Associated Press Writers Jacques Billeaud, Pauline Arrillaga and Paul Davenport in Phoenix and Matt Apuzzo in Washington contributed to this report.

Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] I am facing a new situation today: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.

The war, the pre-eminent episode of Sultan Selim II's reign, began with the Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell quickly to the considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only Famagusta in Venetian hands. Christian reinforcements were delayed, and Famagusta eventually fell in August 1571 after a siege of 11 months. Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, but was unable to take advantage of this victory. The Ottomans quickly rebuilt their naval forces, and Venice was forced to negotiate a separate peace, ceding Cyprus to the Ottomans and paying a tribute of 300,000 ducats.","completion":"What was the Fourth Ottoman-Venetian War, also known as the War of Cyprus, and who were involved in the battles between 1570 and 1573?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Malcom Milliones says he had one thing on his mind. \\"Get my son out,\\" he told Channel 2’s Tom Jones. Video surveillance from the Murphy USA gas station on Old National Highway and Flat Shoals recorded Milliones holding onto the Silver 2014 Kia Optima Sunday around 11 a.m. He says it all began when he pulled up to the gas pumps. \\"I was parked here. My fiancée pulled up directly behind me bumper to bumper,\\" he said. He says his fiancée went into the store and he began pumping gas for his car. Milliones says that's when the thief, who appeared to be a teenager, jumped in his fiancée’s car and took off. \\"I'm kind of like this, hopping with it and running with it,\\" he said, describing how he was holding on for dear life as the car thief drove his fiancé’s SUV out of the gas station.

Write an email with the subject line \\"CNG Fuel Waivers\\".","completion":"Subject: CNG Fuel Waivers [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you today regarding the sought-after Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fuel waivers and our plans to utilize this cleaner and more environmentally friendly fuel source within our organization. As you may be aware, transitioning to CNG has a myriad of benefits, including reduced emissions, cost savings, and improved air quality. I wanted to share vital information about available waivers and the potential impact that this transition may have on our business operations. As part of our commitment towards environmental sustainability, we have been exploring options to shift our existing fleet of vehicles to those powered by CNG and make a substantial reduction in our carbon footprint. In addition, the adoption of CNG offers long-term financial savings, given the typically lower fuel costs when compared to traditional gasoline or diesel. These benefits align well with both our economic and environmental objectives. To assist organizations like ours in adopting CNG as an alternative fuel, various governmental and non-governmental agencies offer waivers and incentives. Here are some of the primary CNG fuel waivers and incentives we may be eligible for: 1. Alternative Fuels Tax Credit: This federal program provides tax credits for businesses that utilize alternative fuels, such as CNG. Eligible parties can claim up to 0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) of CNG used in their fleets. 2. Clean Cities Coalition Network: This network of coalitions promotes the use of cleaner transportation alternatives, including CNG. They provide technical, financial, and informational assistance to organizations looking to transition their fleets to CNG fuel. 3. Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program: As part of the Federal Highway Administration's CMAQ program, funds are allocated to local and state transportation agencies to finance projects that improve air quality and reduce congestion. These agencies may offer incentives for CNG vehicle purchases and fueling infrastructure development. 4. State and Local Grants: Various states and local agencies offer grants to organizations that demonstrate a sincere commitment to alternative fuel adoption. The availability and terms of these grants vary depending on the local jurisdiction. To fully benefit from these waivers and incentives, our company needs to evaluate and determine which options would yield the highest return on investment and align with our strategic goals. In order to accomplish this, I suggest forming a task force that will conduct the following: 1. Assess existing fleet requirements and identify suitable CNG vehicle models. 2. Investigate initial investment costs related to CNG vehicles, infrastructure, and maintenance. 3. Analyze potential savings, GHG emissions reductions, and environmental benefits of transitioning the fleet to CNG. 4. Determine applicable CNG fuel incentives, waivers, and grants while reviewing deadlines and stringent qualification requirements. 5. Develop a comprehensive plan for the adoption of CNG vehicles, and submit required documentation and applications to relevant government agencies to secure waivers and incentives. I look forward to discussing this initiative further and collaboratively identifying the next steps towards transitioning our fleet to CNG fuel. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I will be more than happy to address them. Our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility can only be strengthened by pursuing opportunities such as these. Thank you for your consideration.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger\\". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. After the Beatles' return to London, George Harrison replied to a question about their long-term plans: \\"We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans.\\" His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup. Upon the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.","completion":"This text is about the Beatles, an English rock band.

Here the People Rule In fact, “There is a broad public consensus regarding the causes of the current problems with financial institutions and markets: 79 percent say people taking on too much debt has contributed a lot to the crisis, while 72 percent say the same about banks making risky loans.” This seems sensible. Indeed, as Sept. 11 did not result in a much-feared (by intellectuals) wave of popular Islamophobia or xenophobia, so the market crash has resulted in remarkably little popular hysteria or scapegoating. And considering what has happened, the vulgar public on Main Street has been surprisingly forgiving of those well-educated types on Wall Street — the ones who devised and marketed the sophisticated financial instruments that have brought the financial system to the brink of collapse. Most of the recent mistakes of American public policy, and most of the contemporary delusions of American public life, haven’t come from an ignorant and excitable public. They’ve been produced by highly educated and sophisticated elites. Needless to say, the public’s not always right, and public opinion’s not always responsible. But as publics go, the American public has a pretty good track record. In the 1930s, the American people didn’t fall — unlike so many of their supposed intellectual betters — for either fascism or Communism. Since World War II, the American people have resisted the temptations of isolationism and protectionism, and have turned their backs on a history of bigotry. Now, the Pew poll I cited earlier also showed Barack Obama holding a 50 percent to 40 percent lead over John McCain in the race for the White House. You might think this data point poses a challenge to my encomium to the good sense of the American people. It does. But it’s hard to blame the public for preferring Obama at this stage — given the understandable desire to kick the Republicans out of the White House, and given the failure of the McCain campaign to make its case effectively. And some number of the public may change their minds in the final two weeks of the campaign, and may decide McCain-Palin offers a better kind of change — perhaps enough to give McCain-Palin a victory. The media elites really hate that idea. Not just because so many of them prefer Obama. But because they like telling us what’s going to happen. They’re always annoyed when the people cross them up. Pundits spent all spring telling Hillary Clinton to give up in her contest against Obama — and the public kept on ignoring them and keeping her hopes alive. Why do elites like to proclaim premature closure — not just in elections, but also in wars and in social struggles? Because it makes them the imperial arbiters, or at least the perspicacious announcers, of what history is going to bring. This puts the elite prognosticators ahead of the curve, ahead of the simple-minded people who might entertain the delusion that they still have a choice. But as Gerald Ford said after assuming the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974, ”Here the people rule.” One of those people is Joe Wurzelbacher, a k a Joe the Plumber. He’s the latest ordinary American to do a star turn in our vulgar democratic circus. He seems like a sensible man to me. And to Peggy Noonan, who wrote that Joe “in an extended cable interview Thursday made a better case for the Republican ticket than the Republican ticket has made.” At least McCain and Palin have had the good sense to embrace him. I join them in taking my stand with Joe the Plumber — in defiance of Horace the Poet.

Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) heads out with his local Jindabyne, Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest, recreation, and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body floating face-down in a river, things appear to have turned out for the worst. The largest casualty of the weekend is the men's commonsense. They don't hike out of the ravine, and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches. Then they head out and report the body. The town and the men's lives quickly turn into a mess. The local media swarms them, and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives. Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but has to battle with it through her own mental illness. Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, splayed out on a morgue slab. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and outcast. The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids: Stewart and Claire's son who is being led around by a half-breed Aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before. The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this (again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised). Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface, yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface). None, that is, until Claire forces them to. The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted. There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done; too many loose threads. The acting was okay, but the filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production. I enjoy symbolic films, NORTHFORK being one of my all-time favorites in that vein.

To address the second part of the question, let me gather information on the recovery time for Adem disease. Step 1: Look for information on the recovery time for Adem disease from reliable sources, such as medical journals, research articles, and reputable websites. Step 2: Analyze the information found to determine whether \\"The average time to recover is one to six months\\" is a reasonable answer. According to my research, the recovery time for Adem disease indeed varies from person to person.

However, in more severe cases, the recovery process may take longer, or some symptoms may persist. The prognosis for recovery is generally favorable, with the majority of patients achieving partial or complete recovery.

CHAPTER VI A GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK There was a game of hide and seek that Danny Meadow Mouse once played with Buster Bear. It was a very dreadful game for Danny. But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter in the Green Forest. In the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to keep out of reach of Buster. As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe. Then, too, Danny is a very small person. He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves. Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort. His small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek. It certainly does. But Lightfoot the Deer is big. He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide. Moreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him. He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them. He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life.

Make use of the article to answer the questions. (CNN) -- Mohammad Idrissou put Cameroon on course for a spot in the African Nations Cup quarterfinals with a late winner in a topsy-turvy 3-2 Group D victory over Zambia. Zambia bossed the first half and went ahead inside 10 minutes through Jacob Mulenga. A terrible mistake from Zambia keeper Kennedy Mweene allowed Geremi to equalise and Samuel Eto'o gave Cameroon the lead in the 72nd minute. Christopher Katongo thought he had earned a point with an 82nd-minute penalty but Idrissou had the last word for Cameroon just four minutes later. The Indomitable Lions were looking to ignite their campaign after a shock 1-0 defeat by Gabon in their opening match, which was also a first loss for manager Paul Le Guen. But it got worse for the four-time champions in only the eighth minute, and it was experienced center-back Rigobert Song who was the architect of his own side's downfall. Felix Katongo swung in a great cross from the left and, in attempting to head behind, Song instead drew a point-blank save from his keeper. Carlos Kameni, though, could only push the ball out to Mulenga, who was left with a simple tap-in. Zambia should have doubled their lead before half-time. Rainford Kalaba's fierce free-kick was pushed back into the danger area by Kameni but Christopher Katongo could not direct his shot away from the keeper. And that was made to look very costly in the 68th minute when a calamitous mistake from Mweene saw Cameroon draw level.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Clashes in China's restive Xinjiang region have left 21 people dead, including 15 police officers and officials, authorities say. The violence occurred on Tuesday afternoon in Bachu county, Kashgar prefecture. The foreign ministry said it had been a planned attack by a \\"violent terrorist group\\", but ethnic groups questioned this. There have been sporadic clashes in Xinjiang in recent years. The incidents come amid rumbling ethnic tensions between the Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese communities. In 2009 almost 200 people - mostly Han Chinese - were killed after deadly rioting erupted. Analysis Nothing is stopping foreign journalists from booking flights to Xinjiang after hearing reports of violence there. However, simply travelling to the region doesn't guarantee the ability to dig out the truth behind this story. In 2009, dozens of foreign reporters were permitted to join an official tour of Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, after clashes between minority ethnic Uighur residents and majority Chinese Hans killed 197 people. Their experiences were mixed. Some reporters were able to speak to a variety of people on the ground, while others faced harassment and intimidation. The situation remains the same today. Reporters who travel to the area are closely followed by government minders. Locals often hesitate to answer questions, fearing reprisals from government authorities. Uighur exile groups often provide accounts that differ from the official Chinese government reports. Reconciling the two can be tricky. The situation isn't any easier for Chinese journalists. China's propaganda departments have warned domestic news outlets against conducting their own independent reporting on sensitive Xinjiang stories, ordering them to reprint official stories from China's major state news agencies. It is very difficult to verify reports from Xinjiang, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton. Foreign journalists are allowed to travel to the region but frequently face intimidation and harassment when attempting to verify news of ethnic rioting or organised violence against government authorities. 'Terrorism' Hou Hanmin, director of the Xinjiang government's propaganda department, said Tuesday's clashes began as officials described as community workers searched homes for weapons. She told the BBC's Chinese service that three of the workers were killed as they were investigating reports of suspicious individuals at the home of a local resident. Unarmed police then arrived to investigate the workers' earlier reports and were attacked, said Ms Hou. Three \\"thugs\\" died and nine police officers were cornered in a house which was then set on fire, she said, calling the incident a \\"planned terrorist attack\\" on innocent victims. There was no information on the identity of the assailants. Ten of the officials and police killed were ethnic Uighurs, the local authorities said. Eight people were arrested. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said initial police investigations showed it had been \\"a premeditated attack carried out by a violent terrorist group\\". She said the security situation in Xinjiang was \\"good in general, but a small cluster of terrorist forces are still doing their very best to upset and sabotage Xinjiang's stability and development\\". \\"I believe their plan goes against the will of the people and is doomed to fail,\\" she told a news conference. But Dilxat Raxit, a spokesperson for the World Uighur Congress, an umbrella organisation of Uighur groups, told the BBC the incident was caused by the killing of a young Uighur by Chinese \\"armed personnel\\" as a result of a government clean-up campaign. Uighurs and Xinjiang Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims They make up about 45% of the region's population; 40% are Han Chinese China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East Turkestan Since then, large-scale immigration of Han Chinese Uighurs fear erosion of traditional culture Uighurs make up about 45% of the region's population, but say an influx of Han Chinese residents has marginalised their traditional culture. Beijing authorities often blame violent incidents in Xinjiang on Uighur extremists seeking autonomy for the region. Uighur activists, meanwhile, accuse Beijing of over-exaggerating the threat to justify heavy-handed rule. In March, 20 people were jailed on terrorism and separatism charges in the region. Last August courts jailed another 20 people on similar charges in Xinjiang. ||||| Twenty-one people, including police officers and social workers, have been killed in violent clashes in China's ethnically divided western region of Xinjiang in what the government is calling an act of terrorism. Al Jazeera's Marga Ortigas said on Wednesday police were investigating an arson attack in the region where the violence began. \\"The region has been the focal point for ethnic and racial tensions for quite some time now,\\" Ortigas said. A local official confirmed to the AFP news agency on Wednesday that the battle had taken place. \\"Twenty-one persons were killed in all... including social workers and policemen,\\" the official said. He told the news agency that the violence broke out on Tuesday when three local officials reported a group of suspicious men armed with knives hiding inside a home in Selibuya township outside the city of Kashgar. The death toll was the highest for a single incident in months in Xinjiang, which sees recurrent outbreaks of violence pitting Muslim minority Uyghurs against the authorities and majority ethnic Han Chinese migrants. 'Uyghur repression' Tianshan Net, a government-run news website, described the fighting as a \\"violent terror incident\\". It said 15 of those killed were either police or social workers, with 11 of them being members of China's Uyghur ethnic minority, who mainly live in Xinjiang. Six \\"gang members\\" were shot dead in the violence, while eight more were captured, the report said. The source who spoke to AFP confirmed the contents of the report, but said he did not know how many police were among the dead. The incident points to the chaotic nature of much of the Xinjiang violence, as well as problems with how authorities respond. Armed units are often stationed in larger towns and barracks and must be specially summoned by commanders before they can respond. The Uyghurs have long alleged discrimination in China because of their culture, language and Muslim religion. Last week, the US State Department released a report claiming \\"severe official repression of the freedoms of speech, religion, association, and harsh restrictions on the movement\\" of Uyghurs by the Chinese government. Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, said the case is still being investigated, but accused those involved for plotting \\"to carry out violent terrorist activities\\". \\"China is a country ruled by the law,\\" said Hua. \\"Cracking down on crimes and ensuring the safety of citizens and their property is what the constitution and the law of China entitles the public security authorities to do\\". ||||| BEIJING (Reuters) - A confrontation involving axes, knives, at least one gun and ending with the burning down of a house left 21 people dead in China's troubled far-west region of Xinjiang, a government spokeswoman said on Wednesday, calling it a \\"terrorist attack\\". Nine residents, six police and six ethnic Uighurs were killed in Tuesday's violence, said Hou Hanmin, spokeswoman for the Xinjiang government. It was not immediately clear how many burnt to death. Hou did not name any group, but China has blamed previous attacks in energy-rich Xinjiang - strategically located on the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Central Asia - on Islamic separatists who want to establish an independent East Turkestan. Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people native to Xinjiang, chafe at Chinese controls on their religion, language and culture. Three \\"community workers\\" were patrolling a neighborhood of Bachu County, known as Maralbexi by Uighurs, in Kashgar after a tip-off that there were \\"suspicious people\\" in a private house, Hou said. One of the three used a phone to call for help after they found a number of knives, resulting in their being killed by 14 Uighur \\"rioters\\" in the house, Hou said. \\"The community people were just conducting regular checks, but the action from the rioters was planned and well prepared,\\" Hou said. \\"It's certainly a terrorist attack.\\" Several police and other \\"community workers\\" came in different groups to the home where the Uighurs used axes and large knives to slash the police officers and workers, Hou said. Only one police officer was armed with a gun, she said. The battle ended with the gang members burning down the house, killing the rest of the people there, Hou said. Eight people had been detained. Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the exiled World Uyghur Congress, said the violence was sparked by the shooting and killing of a young Uighur by \\"Chinese armed personnel\\", prompting the Uighurs to fight back. \\"To suppress the fight among the Uighurs, China can engage in arbitrary shootings,\\" Raxit said in an emailed statement. Some Chinese officials also blame such attacks on Muslim militants trained in Pakistan. But many rights groups say China overstates the threat to justify its tight grip on the region.

Who are the Uighurs? Image copyright AFP The Uighurs are Muslims. They regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. The region's economy has for centuries revolved around agriculture and trade, with towns such as Kashgar thriving as hubs along the famous Silk Road. In the early part of the 20th Century, the Uighurs briefly declared independence. The region was brought under the complete control of communist China in 1949. Xinjiang is officially designated an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south. What are their grievances? Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing accuses exiled Uighurs including Rebiya Kadeer of whipping up trouble Activists say central government policies have gradually curtailed the Uighurs' religious, commercial and cultural activities. Beijing is accused of intensifying a crackdown after street protests in Xinjiang in the 1990s, and again in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Over the past decade, many prominent Uighurs have been imprisoned or have sought asylum abroad after being accused of terrorism. Mass immigration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang had made Uighurs a minority in Xinjiang. Beijing is accused of exaggerating the threat from Uighur separatists in order to justify repression in the region. What is the view from Beijing? Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing has poured investment into Xinjiang, but has also flooded the region with security personnel China's central government says Uighur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest. Since the 9/11 attacks in the US, China has increasingly portrayed its Uighur separatists as auxiliaries of al-Qaeda, saying they have received training in Afghanistan. Little evidence has been produced in support of these claims. More than 20 Uighurs were captured by the US military after its invasion of Afghanistan. They were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay for years without being charged with any offence and most have now been resettled elsewhere. When was the last major outbreak of violence? Image copyright AFP Image caption Uighur women protested in a bid to discover the fate of their loved ones Almost 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, the administrative capital of Xinjiang, in July 2009. One of the sparks for the violence seems to have been the deaths of two Uighurs in clashes with Han Chinese at a factory thousands of miles away in southern China. The authorities blame Xinjiang separatists based outside China for the unrest, and they singled out exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer, saying she incited the violence. She denied any responsibility for the violence. Uighur exiles say police fired indiscriminately on peaceful protests, leading to violence and deaths. What is the current situation in Xinjiang? Image copyright AFP Image caption Xinjiang's reputation as an exotic outpost on the famed Silk Road still attracts Han Chinese tourists Xinjiang has received huge state investment in industrial and energy projects, and Beijing has been keen to highlight these as major steps forward. But many Uighurs complain that the Han are taking their jobs, and that their farmland has been confiscated for redevelopment. The activities of local and foreign journalists are closely monitored by the state and there are few independent sources of news from the region. However, occasional attacks on Chinese targets suggest Uighur separatism remains a potent and potentially violent force. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In China's Xinjiang region, there have been violent clashes that left 21 people dead, including 15 police officers and officials. The foreign ministry claimed this was a planned attack by a \\"violent terrorist group\\". Xinjiang has faced sporadic clashes in recent years due to ethnic tensions between the Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese communities. It is difficult to verify reports from Xinjiang as foreign journalists often face intimidation and harassment when attempting to report on ethnic rioting or violence against government authorities."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - Charlotte Fich ( born 26 September 1961 ) is a Danish stage , film and television actress .

Please write a short summary for the following article: An unexpected look into Cambodian rock before the killing fields “When we were young, we loved being modern,” an unseen female narrator says at the start of “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock & Roll,” the 2014 documentary film directed by John Pirozzi. The words are spoken in Khmer, Cambodia’s official language, and translated onscreen, accompanied by stark graphics and ominously rumbling music composed by Scot Stafford. “Then Pol Pot took over Phnom Penh in 1975,” the narrator continues. “I was a singer.” An old photograph of a lovely young woman, smiling and chic, materializes slowly, its sepia tone connoting faded memories. There is a surprise waiting in “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten,” a labor of love that Pirozzi painstakingly assembled over a span of close to a decade, although the story it tells holds no mystery. Anyone who knows the history of modern Cambodia — its peaceful liberation from French occupation in 1953, its rush to modernization under the culturally enlightened monarch Norodom Sihanouk, the incursion of the Vietnam War, and the blood-soaked rise to power of Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge regime, which exacted a horrific toll on intellectuals and artists in particular — will understand that Pirozzi’s topic is not the stuff of happy endings. photo from personal collection of Mol Kamach The band Baksey Cham Krong in the film “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock & Roll.” The surprise, then, is how much tangible evidence of a thriving, joyous Cambodian musical scene the director was able to retrieve and bring to light. Pirozzi, who became aware of Cambodian pop while working on Matt Dillon’s feature film “City of Ghosts” in 2001, pursued his subject with a detective’s resourcefulness and a music nerd’s gusto. In a previous documentary, “Sleepwalking Through the Mekong” (2007), he took the members of Dengue Fever, a Los Angeles band inspired by vintage Khmer pop, to Cambodia, the native land of its lead singer, Chhom Nimol, and tracked down some of the surviving artists of that era. Some of the biggest names in Cambodian pop, understandably, were no longer around to participate — in particular Sinn Sisamouth, a suave, prolific, and trend-setting singer who might be considered the Khmer Sinatra, and who is presumed to have died in the Killing Fields. But Pirozzi located and interviewed witnesses, scholars, and a key handful of musicians, such as Sieng Vanthy. Hers, it turns out, are the voice and the image that open the film. In a gripping interview, Vanthy, who died in 2009, reveals that she’d survived an encounter with the Khmer Rouge by claiming to be a banana merchant. Through miraculously preserved film footage, as well as old photographs and album covers, we are introduced to a lively, swinging milieu that suits perfectly Cambodia’s embrace of all things modern in the ’50s. Its participants — artists and listeners alike — are young and happy, their adoption of French and English styles, Latin American influences, and American appropriations adept and joyous. Viewers will delight in discovering acts like the twangy Baksey Cham Krong, Cambodia’s eminent surf-guitar combo, and the heavier, funkier Drakkar — both of which have reunited to reap unexpected benefits provided by screenings of Pirozzi’s film. The music, the stuff of cultish collectors for decades, is thrilling. And although there is genuine horror in the way that many of these luminaries were cast into shadow, prematurely and brutally, there remains a certain triumph to be had in Pirozzi’s film. It offers confirmation, if not exactly consolation, that brighter efforts of the human spirit can sometimes persevere. • ‘The Look of Silence’ revisits the 1965 Indonesian genocide • Following the path of justice in Florida in ‘3½ Minutes, Ten Bullets’ • In ‘The Tribe,’ a school for the deaf becomes the world Summary:","completion":"\\"Don't Think I've Forgotten: Cambodia's Lost Rock & Roll\\" is a 2014 documentary film directed by John Pirozzi that explores the vibrant Cambodian musical scene prior to Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime. The documentary is a result of painstaking work done by Pirozzi over nearly a decade to locate tangible evidence of a thriving musical scene that was lost during the political turmoil. The film offers confirmation that the brighter efforts of the human spirit can sometimes persevere, despite the tragic end experienced by many of the musicians featured in the documentary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: On December 8, 1991, at Viskuli near Brest (Belarus), the President of the Russian SFSR and the heads of Byelorussian SSR and Ukrainian SSR signed the \\"Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States\\" (known in media as Belavezha Accords). The document, consisting of a preamble and fourteen articles, stated that the Soviet Union ceased to exist as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality. However, based on the historical community of peoples, relations between them, given the bilateral treaties, the desire for a democratic rule of law, the intention to develop their relations based on mutual recognition and respect for state sovereignty, the parties agreed to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR by an overwhelming majority: 188 votes for, 6 against, 7 abstentions. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and recalled all Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The legality of this act is the subject of discussions because, according to the 1978 Constitution (Basic Law) of the Russian SFSR, the Russian Supreme Soviet had no right to do so. However, by this time the Soviet government had been rendered more or less impotent, and was in no position to object. Although the December 12 vote is sometimes reckoned as the moment that the RSFSR seceded from the collapsing Soviet Union, this is not the case. It appears that the RSFSR took the line that it was not possible to secede from an entity that no longer existed. Question: What body ratified the Belavezha Accords on December 12?","completion":"The Belavezha Accords were ratified on December 12, 1991, by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR (Soviet Federative Socialist Republic), which was the legislative body of the Russian SFSR. The ratification received an overwhelming majority of 188 votes in favor, 6 against, and 7 abstentions. This event marked a significant step in the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the fact that: When we add resistors in parallel to each other the total resistance decreases and the current increases. Answer the question: If current increases, that means resistance is increasing or decreasing? The answer to this question is:","completion":"When current increases, that means resistance is decreasing. Here's the step-by-step explanation and justification: 1. Ohm's Law states that Voltage (V) is equal to the product of Current (I) and Resistance (R), which is V = IR. 2. When resistors are added in parallel, the total resistance (R_total) decreases. This occurs because the inverse of the total resistance is equal to the sum of the inverses of each individual resistance: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn. Consequently, R_total will always be less than the smallest individual resistance in the parallel circuit. 3. With a constant voltage, as R_total decreases, according to Ohm's Law (V = IR), the current (I) must increase to maintain the same voltage across the circuit. 4. So when the current increases in a parallel circuit, it's a result of the total resistance decreasing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.
